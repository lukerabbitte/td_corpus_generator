#EndaKenny	2017-12-05	dail	32	Personal Explanation by Member	dbsect_36	In the Dáil on 17 November 2004 statements were allowed on the abduction and murder of Margaret Hassan, an Irish national in Iraq. During the course of those statements I said Margaret Hassan had converted to Islam. This statement was untrue. Margaret Hassan was a devout Catholic who continued to practice her religion during the years she was in Iraq. I wish, therefore, to have the Official Report for the Dáil of 17 November 2004 corrected to indicate that Margaret Hassan had not converted to Islam but was, in fact, a devout and practising Catholic. I regret not having done so prior to this. While her body has never been recovered, I hope some day that will happen and that she will receive a Christian burial.	spk_264

#EndaKenny	2017-06-14	dail	32	Resignation of Taoiseach	dbsect_2	A Cheann Comhairle, tá orm a chur in iúl duit gur éirigh mé as oifig mar Thaoiseach inné trína chur sin in iúl don Uachtarán de bhun an Bhunreachta. Yesterday I resigned from the office of Taoiseach by placing my resignation in the hands of the President, pursuant to the Constitution.	spk_2
#EndaKenny	2017-06-14	dail	32	Nomination of Taoiseach	dbsect_3	Tairgim:Go n-ainmneoidh Dáil Éireann an Teachta Leo Varadkar le bheith ceaptha ag an Uachtarán mar Thaoiseach. I move:That Dáil Éireann nominate Deputy Leo Varadkar for appointment by the President to be Taoiseach. Having worked closely with Deputy Varadkar throughout his political career I am confident that he will carry out the role of An Taoiseach with energy, integrity and skill. From his deep involvement in the Young Fine Gael movement as a young student to his election to Fingal County Council in 2004 and his election to this House, Dáil Éireann, in 2007, Deputy Varadkar has demonstrated the drive and the commitment that are required to succeed in politics. Immediately upon his election to this House I appointed him to the Fine Gael Front Bench, first in the enterprise brief and later as spokesman on energy and communications. In both roles he worked diligently in developing new and innovative policy proposals. Since then I had the privilege of being first elected Taoiseach in 2011 and have had the privilege of appointing Deputy Varadkar to three separate Cabinet positions, as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Minister for Health and more recently as Minister for Social Protection. In each of these Ministries Deputy Varadkar has had significant achievements, whether the revitalisation of the tourism industry, the oversight of The Gathering, stabilising the health service and rolling out free general practitioner, GP, care for children younger than six years or increasing the weekly payments to those dependent on social welfare. In 2011 the Irish people elected a new Government to rescue the economy, to get Ireland working again and Deputy Varadkar in his Ministries was central to that work. Today our country is in a much stronger position than previously, the troika has left, unemployment has fallen dramatically and the public finances are in very good shape. However, many challenges remain, not least in areas such as health and housing and child poverty. We must continue to manage the economy carefully so that it generates the resources that we need to rebuild our essential public services. As Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar will meet these challenges head on, including Brexit and Ireland's future place in the European Union. As the country's youngest holder of this office he will speak for a new generation of Irishwomen and Irishmen. He represents a modern, diverse and inclusive Ireland and will speak for it like no other, an Ireland in which each person can fulfil his or her potential and live his or her dreams. I wish Deputy Varadkar and his team every success in the challenges that lie ahead. I have no doubt but that he will build on the solid foundations on which our country now stands and that he will see that it is managed carefully in the people's interests and that the decisions his Government will make will always hold the people as central to those decisions. I therefore commend his name to the House for selection as Taoiseach of Ireland.	spk_3
#EndaKenny	2017-06-13	dail	32	Resignation of Taoiseach	dbsect_2	"Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Nach iontach ar fad go bhfuil slua mór anseo inniu. Ba mhaith liom a chur in iúl duit, a Cheann Comhairle, tar éis ghnó na Dála seo, go mbeidh mé ag dul amach go hÁras an Uachtaráin, go dtabharfaidh mé litir ag éirí as an bpost seo chuig an Uachtarán agus go mbeidh sé sin ag dul i bhfeidhm láithreach.I was hoping that having said that much, I could leave quickly and quietly but the business of the Dáil is such that I no longer have any control over how it is to be conducted. The prospect of making a speech or listening to them, either of glorification or flagellation, is not something that I really relish because this has never been about me. It has always been about the problems and challenges our people and country face. That said, I am very happy to have the opportunity to thank the Ceann Comhairle, his predecessors and all the staff of the House for their assistance and unfailing courtesy not just over the last six years as Taoiseach but over the past 42 years since I have been a Member of the House. It was Teddy Roosevelt who said ""Far and away the best prize that life has to offer is the chance to work hard at work worth doing."" I have been truly blessed I have had that chance. I am eternally grateful to the Irish people and particularly the people of Mayo for repeatedly giving me that opportunity. I really believe that politics is work worth doing, a noble profession. Despite the many scandals and disappointments, I believe the vast majority of people elected to this House are here because we have an interest in and love for our communities and country and we wish to make a difference. For me, cynicism is always an easy cop-out. The true measure of worth and courage is to keep trying again and again, knowing that much of that effort will go unrewarded. I understand the people's disillusionment with politics and the political process. I believe that a first step towards overcoming that might be for us as politicians to treat one other with a greater degree of respect. We can argue vehemently the merits of issues or measures without questioning one another's motives or intent. Politics is always about people and government is always about making decisions. For my own part, I am the first to acknowledge I have not got everything right but I can honestly say my motivation was always what I believed was in the best interests of the Irish people. I thank my colleagues in government for their efforts and support in trying to make an unprecedented and difficult situation work. I also wish to recognise the contributions of the Members opposite, of the Fianna Fáil Party with their leader, Deputy Micheál Martin. It would be remiss of me not to mention the Labour Party for its enormous contribution to the success of the last Government, which under the leadership of Eamon Gilmore and Deputy Joan Burton, with the central involvement of the current leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Brendan Howlin, played a critical role in the rescue of the economy. I thank them all for that. To my party colleagues, I want to say it has been a privilege and a pleasure to have had the opportunity to lead the party for 15 years, and the last six years in government. I wish them all good health to continue the work to overcome and deal with the many challenges that lie ahead.  I passed through Strade recently, which is the birthplace and final resting place of Michael Davitt. To paraphrase what he said in his will to the Irish people, to all my friends I leave kind thoughts, to others I express my fullest forgiveness and to Ireland my undying prayer for absolute freedom and independence, which it has always been my ambition to achieve for her. I hope that in the two Governments I have led, we have made a modest contribution towards that ambition. "	spk_2
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_20	Deputy Martin is asking what action the Government took on the basis of the circumstances in which we found ourselves in 2011. Some €20 billion had been invested by the taxpayer. Jobs were haemorrhaging by the tens of thousands, interest rates on money borrowed by the country were 15% and unemployment was rising. We set out to improve that position, and that is what has happened in terms of the interest rates on the promissory note and the leverage we have at a European level. As I said, €20 billion of taxpayers' money was put into what was supposed to be the greatest deal of all, that is, a €64 billion debt burden on our people. We recovered €6.6 billion through capital repayments, interest, income and fees. The State still owns 99.9% of the ordinary share capital and a further €0.2 billion has been paid to the State through the bank levy. The primary objective of the State was to recover all of the investment from AIB. The Minister for Finance believes that is a realistic objective over a period of time. I said to Deputy Martin yesterday that the sale of the bank shares would not result in any beneficial impact on the general Government balance as it would not be counted as revenue. Therefore, there is no increased capacity to spend. The proceeds from any IPO would be used to pay down debt, and the Minister has made that perfectly clear. We are now in the process of being in a much stronger position than we were, with almost full employment, and the deficit is to be eliminated next year. There are serious challenges in terms of the level of personal debt that applies.  The negotiations are now beginning, with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, on an extension of the Lansdowne Road agreement and a review of the capital programme. Significant amounts of money still remain unallocated. The Government has made decisions on the unprecedented levels of money available for dealing with the housing crisis.  As I have pointed out, the Government has made decisions to work with the European Investment Bank on further, long-term, low interest funds for major pieces of infrastructure. The challenges ahead are ones the Government is already looking at, not in the way Governments of the past looked at the development of a spatial strategy. People on this side wrote down 53 towns to be developed, but nothing ever happened.  Ireland will increase its population by 1 million people over the next number of years and we will need 500,000 houses. We have to consider how those people will be transported. The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment is delivering elements of the programme for broadband and a national contract is to be issued for that next year. There is a contract in place with Eir for the provision of fibre broadband to homes in many places. The Minister has been very clear that now is the optimum time to dispose of a portion of AIB, leaving the State with a very significant holding. Obviously, advice was received on a constant basis but the opportunity did not present itself in the way it does now. It is not a case of not examining the infrastructure requirements we have. They are very big priorities for Government. In this particular case, as has been pointed out, it is a transaction that does not result in any increased spending money and will, therefore, be used to write down debt, as the Minister has confirmed on many occasions.	spk_86
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_20	The Minister for Finance has repeatedly identified the particular demographics of this country having regard to these rules. Money has to be paid back and capital is treated differently from current funding. It is not a case of not focusing on the priorities we have all identified. The Government has put forward €5 billion for housing.	spk_88
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_20	The problem here is to get the system moving from the total collapse of a number of years ago to provide the number of houses, social and everything else, that is now needed. The Minister has raised the question of the treatment of capital at European level in his discussions with finance ministers but it has to be paid back. I know Deputy Martin supports the proportionate sale of AIB here. Obviously, the question of demographics has been raised by us repeatedly and we have identified the kind of country we would like to see and the infrastructure it will require over the next ten, 15 and 20 years. There is a need for increased capital expenditure, but one has to have the engine of an economy to drive that. Clearly from a European point of view, investments that will come from the loan process with the European Investment Bank will have a significant impact on some of the very major infrastructure projects that lie ahead.	spk_91
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_20	I am not sure what kind of speech that is. I thank the Deputy for his words. If I recall properly, I remember Deputy Adams as president of his party, coming in here week after week saying we should default.	spk_98
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_20	"His mantra was ""burn the bondholders"" and he was opposed to everything European. He campaigned actively against nine referenda in which the Irish people voted."	spk_100
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_20	He was opposed bitterly to having the taxpayer put money into AIB and now he is opposed to getting the money back. That is consistency I suppose from the leader of Sinn Féin.	spk_102
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_20	I have not mentioned the Northern Bank. I am not sure if it was Irish money or sterling but I did not mention the Northern Bank. Deputy Adams has been consistent about burning bondholders-----	spk_104
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_20	-----that Ireland should default, that our economy would never recover, that we are a Third World country and that nothing was ever right here. I do not know if he even sees the sun shining on these summer days. The previous Government and this one have continued the process of rectifying an unholy and unprecedented mess that was inherited. We have dealt with that-----	spk_106
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_20	-----to the point that the country is in a much stronger position than it was previously.	spk_108
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_20	There are still many challenges ahead and I hope the Government continues to do its duty in office. It will focus entirely on decisions that will be made in the interests of the people. This is one decision that is in the interests of the people. The Minister has taken advice over a long period and the optimum time is now. The economic circumstances are very good and this is a test of the value - it will be floated on the stock exchange - of what a 25% offering for AIB will bring in. Over the next decade or so, it will bring about a situation in which private banking offers competition in the interests of a strong economy and an opportunity for people. Deputy Adams can stick with his mantra. He spoke to me last week about long goodbyes and I offered to wait for him. I understand the movement is now asserting that Deputy Adams should stand up and make a declaration as to his future intentions also.	spk_110
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_20	I thank him for his consistency. I do not share his view. This is the right thing to do with AIB and now is the right time to do it.	spk_112
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_20	We favour a situation where the bank would be restored to being a private banking enterprise and where it would provide competition in the interests of the country. If I recall correctly, another of the Deputy's mantras was that the troika should be sent home.	spk_118
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_20	I agree because one of the saddest days I attended here was the day our sovereignty was taken from us-----	spk_120
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_20	-----when the late Minister for Finance and the former Taoiseach walked off the Government stage and were replaced by the troika, led by Mr. Chopra. The call was that they should be sent home. They are gone. The previous Government was in a position to exit the bailout programme, despite the fact that people had stated we could not do it and that very difficult conditions would be imposed.	spk_122
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_20	They have left our shores and we have retrieved our sovereignty and restored our economic independence. Furthermore, we have also given the flag back to the people with a new sense of understanding and respect. Deputy Gerry Adams says this is in the interests of the bankers. There were 225,000 new jobs created in the past few years. The young men and young women of this country work to build our economy and international reputation and send the brand image that we are not afraid to face up to our challenges or make hard decisions and that we are not afraid to make sacrifices in the interests of everybody. While we have many challenges ahead, we are in a much better position than we were. Had we followed the Deputy's line, I hate to think where we would be now.	spk_124
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_20	We have had a lot of discussions about this issue already. The Government made the decision, which the Houses accepted, that the Charleton inquiry should be set up. As I pointed out to Deputy Mick Barry yesterday, the appointment of Mr. Justice Charleton was exceptionally appropriate, having dealt with the Morris tribunal for over a decade in County Donegal. I prefer to let him and his commission do their work. I do not know whether the allegation about the particular phone being missing is true or not, but the justice has set out the timescale and the hearings that are to take place. There will be public hearings of the commission in July on this very issue. The Committee of Public Accounts is meeting this morning and I have heard some of the comments made about the discrepancies in some of the contributions being made. Be that as it may, the House has set up a commission of investigation, a tribunal, to deal with this matter and no better person than Mr. Justice Charleton to deal with it. The Deputy's question about the previous Commissioner was the subject of a full-scale commission of investigation which made its judgment and ruling. Obviously, the current Commissioner is one of the people whom I named yesterday as having legal representation at the Charleton inquiry. The hearings will take place in public in July, which is not too far distant. I expect Mr. Justice Charleton to find out the veracity of the allegations, the facts and the truth. That is why he was appointed.	spk_126
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_20	The Deputy completely underestimates the capacity of Mr. Justice Charleton who is the sole member in charge of a full tribunal. He is not the kind of person who will be led astray by filtered information. Believe me, if the Deputy is suggesting the tribunal liaison group is deliberately filtering information to him that is either irrelevant or not meaningful, he is not the kind of person who will let it pass by.I have every faith in Mr. Justice Charleton doing 100% of what he has been appointed to do. He is not the type of person to accept information that might be filtered or which he might be asked to accept as being the full truth. His job is to find that out and I have 100% faith in him doing that. The people who appear before him had better be very clear in the answers they give him.	spk_128
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_20	How long do I have, a Cheann Comhairle?	spk_135
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_20	I thank Deputy Grealish for his kind comments. I hope to see him in Pearse Stadium on Sunday week and I hope he will be as kind to me then when we take to the field. I have absolutely no regrets about having appointed Deputy Simon Coveney and Deputy Leo Varadkar as Ministers. They are two fine young men who have a real opportunity-----	spk_138
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_20	They might not have been my supporters when my friend Richard took to the field some years ago. Be that as it may, I was happy to appoint them to Front Bench positions, to watch them grow as Ministers and to bring about a situation where they have actively and vigorously campaigned around the country for the last number of weeks for the right to lead this party. Whatever the decision of the Fine Gael electorate is, I hope that whoever is elected leader of the party will continue in government and will always make decisions in the interests of our people. Every decision it makes and every step the Government takes should be about the country and the people. I am sure that is deeply embedded in their political philosophy. From my perspective, I have been a Member of the House for a long time. I have seen all the tensions and all the outbreaks of viciousness and sometimes fisticuffs when people were being either moved on after elections or shoved out the gate. I have always made it clear that instinct is important for politicians and, indeed, sports people. After 42 years in the House, 13 elections, 15 years as leader of a major party and six years as Taoiseach, I am happy to be in a position to transfer responsibility to a younger generation. That is important in all walks of life. As for advice, it is a little later than people think and there is no time to waste. When the new Government is appointed, in whatever structure that might be, it must get on with challenges we face of keeping our economy moving, dealing with child poverty and homelessness, the provision of employment and creating the infrastructure we spoke about for the people who will live in this country over the next 30 or 40 years. As for regrets, I do not have any. Anybody who holds the position of Taoiseach had better have an optimistic and positive outlook. There is no point in going around looking like one is weighed down with the problems of the world.	spk_140
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_20	They existed before us and one must deal with them head-on and make the best decisions one can. I recall the Latin adage,  I thank Deputy Grealish for his comments. I appreciate them.	spk_142
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_20	I appreciate the Deputy's comments. I will pass them on to somebody who is absolutely delighted.	spk_144
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_21	I agree with the Deputy that boxing is not in crisis. The sports capital system has supported boxing clubs during the terms of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments over the years. The number of young boys and girls involved in boxing as a discipline, science and sport continues to increase. On Monday, I was in the north inner city and visited Ballybough Boxing Club. It has brand new facilities and really good coaches and it is doing a wonderful job. I am a big supporter of Bernard Dunne. He is a wonderful example to young people. He rose to become world champion in his weight division. I hope the personalities involved in the matter raised by the Deputy can work this out. As the Deputy rightly pointed out, Irish boxers have been very successful in many Olympic Games. Ireland is recognised by other countries as being outstanding in this regard and one of the top countries in the world. I hope, therefore, that the powers that be, or the personalities within the IABA, along with the Minister of State dealing with this, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, and the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, can come to an understanding that is in the interest of thousands of young people and in order that there will be a body that works in everybody's interest. After all, the Deputy's Government and a succession of Governments have put money into the facilities in Dublin and around the country. Through these, young people learn discipline, character formation and the science of boxing, if that is what they love. It is a sport in which they can rise to be world champions in their respective weight divisions. The Deputy's message is one that I fully understand.	spk_151
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_21	This is an important judgment by the Supreme Court. The Tánaiste, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and the Minister of State with direct responsibility in this area, Deputy David Stanton, have done a lot of work on this. Within the past month, before this judgment, they asked their officials to begin work to identify the options for and the barriers to asylum seekers gaining access to the labour market in particular circumstances. This judgment, therefore, gives this work increased priority. As the judgment has only just become available, as the Deputy is aware, the Department of Justice and Equality officials, together with the Office of the Attorney General, will examine it in the immediate future. It is important to note that the International Protection Act, which introduces the single application procedure for protection applicants, was brought through the Oireachtas by the Tánaiste and commenced on 30 December 2016. That is important legislation. The new Act is specifically designed to address the delays in decision-making on asylum claims. Since the beginning of the year, applications have already been decided with applicants having been recognised as refugees who can access the labour market now. Overall, 92% of the 173 recommendations in the McMahon report are now implemented or partially implemented, or are in progress. That is a significant increase on the figure of 80% in the first audit of progress, which was published last June. One hundred and twenty-one of the recommendations are now implemented, with a further 38 partially implemented or in progress. It includes the key recommendation of the working group, that is, the one on the introduction of the single application procedure within our international protection process. I do not have any difficulty at all in saying to the Deputy that the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, in particular, will be happy to engage with Opposition Members to discuss the outcome of the ruling of the Supreme Court. I expect that once officials from the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Justice and Equality have gone through the judgment in detail, the Minister of State will be very happy to have a discussion with Opposition Members and move on in the context of the findings of the Supreme Court.	spk_153

#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_21	That is very good. The homemaker's tax credit was increased in the budget. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, has commented that she would like to see it increased further in recognition of the value of people caring in the home. I do not want to pronounce further on it at this point. Obviously, with regard to the shape and structure of the new Government, the matter will be addressed in the preparation of the budget for 2018.	spk_167
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_21	I thank the Deputy for his comments. Both Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland were given the resources and the opportunity to recruit extra personnel. Detailed negotiations on Brexit have not yet started-----	spk_169

#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_21	I admit that we have not brought the matter to a conclusion. I am sorry about that, but let me see what we can do in the time remaining to me. In fairness to the Deputy, he has raised it consistently. I know that there are discussions taking place between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Health on the cost and structure of the scheme, but they have drifted for too long without reaching finality.	spk_183
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_21	I will inquire about this. It is not just a case of them lying there. There are matters to be attended to before they can be signed off on. I will get back to the Deputy. Let us have an analysis of the entire scale, not just in the Department of Justice and Equality but in other Departments where legislation dealt with has not been commenced.	spk_187
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_21	The situation regarding recruitment has changed. There is a very active recruitment drive with young nurses now being offered permanent contracts. I am not sure of the details of what the Deputy is referring to in respect of only temporary contracts being offered. I will discuss this with the Minister and come back to her. I take her point about the lady who gave birth at the hospital. I am glad her baby is well.	spk_190
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_21	I will ask the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, who has the detail of this, to respond to the Deputy's query.	spk_192
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_21	It is not a case of allocating funding for a strategic development zone. As he is aware, strategic development zones mean that there are expedited planning permissions. The detail of the strategic development zone in this case outlines the kinds of development that can take place within the almost 500 acres allocated for the zone around the entire airport facility. The local authority has already produced its local plan, which was the advice received a number of years ago, and the proposition through the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government was that the Government should now back this with approval for a strategic development zone. It is not a case of saying here is a certain amount of money. We now have the opportunity to follow through the development of that local authority plan with expedited planning permissions and business and commerce associated with the airline business, be that hangars or hotels.

#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_25	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together. My Department, as outlined in the strategy statement, provides support services for the Taoiseach and the Government. As part of this service, the parliamentary liaison unit was established to perform a liaison function to help ensure that Ministers and Departments are properly and fully informed of new responsibilities and procedures in the Thirty-second Dáil. The unit provides support to Ministers and their Departments on Oireachtas matters with a particular emphasis on assisting Departments with Private Members' business. It provides Departments with detailed information on the rules and procedures with regard to Private Members' business. In performing this function, the unit liaises on a regular basis with advisers to the Independent members of Government, including the chief strategist for the Independent Alliance and the political co-ordinator for the Independent Ministers in Government, to ensure that they are informed of Oireachtas issues and to assist them in engaging with the new processes arising from the Dáil reform changes. In this regard, the parliamentary liaison unit provides detailed information on upcoming matters in the Dáil and Seanad and highlights any new Oireachtas reform issues for their information.	spk_228
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_25	For the information of Deputy Haughey who asked this question previously, arrangements have been made by the Government, which has a different structure of government than any previously in a situation where there is a supply and confidence agreement with the Deputy's party, with Deputy Micheál Martin as leader, and which is set out to be followed. The same applies in the case of the Independent Alliance and any others who support the Government. All of these have been published. This liaison unit does not have anything to do with that. It is staffed by a principal officer, a higher executive officer and a clerical officer. As I said, it provides support for Ministers and their Departments on Oireachtas matters with particular emphasis on helping with Private Members' business. As the Deputy will be aware, amendments can be quite complex and detailed and the structures of that are explained to Ministers and their Departments as to what particular amendments might mean. The unit does not have any political function, for example, in dealing with Beaumont Hospital or a new emergency department there. That is an arrangement that has been agreed, between, in this case, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and the Government, and to fulfil that it must be able to be the subject of discussion by the Minister for Health and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and be in compliance with best practice. However, they all have been published. When Deputy Haughey states there is a need for transparency, openness and accountability, I share that view. The Deputy is long enough in the game to understand that people will jump at the first sign of seeking credit for issues that might just happen. Of course, anybody in politics who looks for credit anyway is a fool because the public will move on to the next item very quickly indeed-----	spk_230
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_25	-----not that Deputy Haughey ever sought that kind of shallow outcome for his politics. All these aspect are published and the staff involved comprises, as I stated, a principal officer, a higher executive officer and clerical officer. They do not have a political policy function. They explain the workings of the new changed Dáil, including Private Members' time and Private Members' legislation, and explain to Ministers the detailed rules and procedures that now surround Private Members' business.	spk_232
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_25	In respect of the issue that the Deputy raises, it is important when an election is over that the judgment given by the people is then considered carefully to see is it possible to put a government together. It took some time to put this one together last year. It is a Government of the Fine Gael Party supported by the Independent Alliance, a number of Independents in Cabinet and some others outside, and of course, the main Opposition party, Fianna Fáil, in respect of a confidence and supply agreement. Part of the discussions that took place at the outset was about a change in the way that members of the Judiciary are appointed. Deputy Nolan will appreciate that the Constitution is clear in that the Government makes the appointments and the Cabinet must have choices when making those appointments.Part of the discussions with the Independent Alliance was about the nature of that structure. As the Deputies are aware, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, has been around for quite a number of years. That board assesses the credentials, legal experience and the kinds of cases that candidates may have heard to determine their suitability for appointment to the District Court, Circuit Court, High Court, Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court. What was approved yesterday by Government was the Judicial Appointments Bill which will now proceed through the Houses and hopefully become law this year. The other Bill in respect of the conduct and the oversight of conduct by members of the Judiciary is the Judicial Council Bill.  This does not represent a Minister stepping outside his brief. In this case, the Minister, Deputy Ross, working with his group of Deputies, said that this was an issue that they considered to be very important. It became a focus of discussion between the parties in terms of including it in the programme for Government. That is why it is there in the published document. In the case of Waterford, this was not an issue that came out of the blue suddenly. There was a very particular letter issued by the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, which had been considered very carefully by the medical personnel in Waterford. The Minister has responded with a mobile unit providing cardiac facilities in Waterford.	spk_234

That meant that whatever arrived in tír na ríthe down in the south could be claimed as being part of the agreement and the deal. All these points have been published and the unit just provides the procedural, detailed information for Deputies, Ministers and their Departments."	spk_238
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_25	Well, his name is Shane Ross, not Walter Mitty. I must say that his brief carries him into stormy as well as calm waters. As someone who has been a national journalist for many years, he has learned a good deal about the responsibilities of politics at ministerial level. I am very happy with the way that he goes about his business. In respect of what Deputy Howlin said, he will be aware from his own experience that Cabinet operates on the basis of collective responsibility. All the candidates whose names came to Cabinet were deemed to be experienced, professionally competent and suitable to be nominated to the particular bench to which they applied. It is not a case of somebody going through the file and the experience of each nominee-----	spk_247
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_25	These have been assessed and cleared by the JAAB.	spk_249
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_25	I can confirm to Deputy Howlin that when the nominees were presented by the Minister for Justice and Equality, they were accepted in the normal way by the Cabinet, unanimously and without any comment. I do not want to say anything about newspaper reports and analysis. All the nominees were cleared by the JAAB as being competent and professional. The new Bill, when it is passed, will reduce the number of nominees for each position but it will still be the responsibility of Cabinet, under the Constitution, to make the choices. I acknowledge the mobile unit is not yet in place. Obviously, the Minister for Health is conscious of that fact and is working on the matter. That was the outcome of the discussions that were held with the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, at the time.	spk_251
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_25	I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive, together. I have restructured my Department to ensure that Brexit is treated as a crucial cross-cutting issue by creating an amalgamated international, EU and Northern Ireland division under a second Secretary General who also acts as the Government's Sherpa for EU business, including Brexit. The work of this division includes supporting the Cabinet committee on Brexit and the Cabinet committee on European affairs. There are 32 staff assigned to this division. The international, EU and Northern Ireland division comprises three sections.The international section advises me on international policy and supports me in my international engagements with a particular focus on driving economic growth, trade, investment and job creation, as well as protecting and strengthening Ireland’s strategic relationships, interests and reputation overseas. The EU section supports me in my role as a member of the European Council and provides a coherent, whole-of-Government strategic direction on priority EU policies, including on Brexit. The Britain and Northern Ireland affairs section supports my work and the work of the Government in helping to maintain peace and to develop new relationships on the island of Ireland and between Britain and Ireland. This section supports me and the Government in ensuring there is a whole-of-Government response to the UK’s decision to leave the EU and the implications of that decision for Northern Ireland and the British-Irish relationship. Staff in other divisions also contribute to the work on Brexit. For example, the economic policy division advises me on economic policy aimed at supporting sustainable economic growth, with a particular focus on jobs and competitiveness, including possible economic impacts of Brexit. I have three special advisers, including my chief of staff. The Government Chief Whip has two special advisers. The Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, the EU digital single market and data protection has one special adviser, whose salary is paid by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The Minister of State with responsibility for defence has two special advisers, both of whom are paid by the Department of Defence. The Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora has no special adviser. Although they are not special advisers, the chief strategist for the Independent Alliance and the political co-ordinator for Independent Ministers are also based in my Department.	spk_252
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_25	I can supply Deputy Martin with the audit he mentioned. I will forward him the numbers we have in terms of the appointments of diplomats and other staff who are working in different places. The Deputy made the point previously that it may become necessary to recruit or appoint people with particular experience, for instance, in trade and in the complex issues involved in that area. There is a willingness that when it becomes necessary, we can and will do that. When the issue was raised about Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, as I said, they look for particular types of people, but these negotiations have not started. Deputy Howlin is right on this. We still have a great deal of information to get from those with whom we will negotiate. Deputy Howlin made the point about knowing the thinking of people at a European level. From his experience and from that of Deputy Martin as a former Minister, it is about the building of relationships that last over a long period.	spk_259
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_25	At the end of the day, this Brexit business will have to be decided by the European Council and every country represented on it has a veto. If issues arise that are not acceptable, as I have no doubt they will-----	spk_261
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_25	It has got to be agreed at the European Council.	spk_263
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_25	Yes, but if somebody at the European Council will not accept the outcome of the deal, we will have a real problem. Deputy Howlin made a point about knowing the thinking of other European colleagues, and it takes time to build those relationships, but, as he is aware, it comes down to the European Council's decision, it is the Heads of Government who will make the ultimate decision. I take the Deputy's comments in the spirit that he made them. The presentation of our priorities, as we see them, without having all of the information in so far as what the British Government's thinking is on this, have been reflected in the Commission, Parliament and Council. However, as the Deputy pointed out, in terms of having as close as possible a working relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom, which is what we have now as a member of the European Union, that will be changed by virtue of the fact that the Single Market will be gone and the trading status will be changed. Therefore, when we go around that loop and come back to where we started we will be in a different position. Even if no tariffs will apply in terms of trade, we will still have two different jurisdictions and the complications that would involve are obvious. An Open Skies arrangement will have to be drawn up between the European Union and the United Kingdom, otherwise, aircraft will not be able to take off from here and land in London and go on to collect other passengers. That is an issue that needs to be dealt with and it is being worked upon now. We cannot wait for divorce to be concluded to do that.  The three issues identified by Michael Barnier here and agreed by Europe are the border, modalities and liabilities in terms of what the bill might be and the question of citizen's rights and reciprocal rights. All these matters, as was rightly said, were never put to the people in a way that they would have had a real discussion about understanding them. That is why our common travel area, which has been in place for 90 years covering travel, residence and the right to work and to draw social benefits, is a bilateral arrangement between Ireland and the UK and it is different with respect to rights of the Polish people or Lithuanians or Latvians who live in Great Britain. The European position is that if we want to have a parallel discussion begun, where we get into the meat of trade, we will have to make substantial progress in respect of the first three issues. I hear comments from some people across the water to the effect that progress will not be made on this, which clearly will lead to other complications.	spk_265
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_25	I take the Deputy's point. A no deal situation would be catastrophic for Ireland in, for example, the beef and agrifood sectors. Deputy Nolan spoke about the Brexit position. We did not cause this, we were not responsible for it and we did not want it but we have to deal with it. In respecting the vote of the British electorate, clearly, the issues that are priority have been set out for us. Dr. Pfeiffer is perfectly entitled to his opinion but this is decided at the European Council from a European point of view. One can have all the opinions, all the ideas and all the propositions one wants but at the end of the day, political leaders have to make decisions and the choices sometimes are not very palatable. That is why we were happy to get unanimous support from all the other 26 member states to say that Ireland's priorities are understood and Ireland's unique position is understood. We should remember that Brexit does not interfere with the Good Friday Agreement and we will not let it interfere with it. The Agreement was signed 19 years before Brexit ever became a reality.	spk_267
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_25	Thank you. In recognising the visionaries of the Good Friday Agreement, we have had support from Europe, in that, if the Agreement is ever implemented in full, that is, with a vote for consent by the democratic decision of people to join the Republic, the entire Island would be recognised as an entity of the European Union in full without having to reapply for membership.	spk_269
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_25	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 9, inclusive, together. We are confident that the European Council’s adoption of the EU’s negotiating guidelines on 29 April gives Ireland its strongest hand going into these complex negotiations. The unique circumstances of Ireland have been recognised as part of the negotiations from the outset.  The Government’s priority here has been to ensure that the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, including the Good Friday Agreement which already exists, are recognised and protected within the context of the Article 50 negotiations leading to a withdrawal agreement. The Good Friday Agreement is an internationally recognised treaty, legally binding and registered with the UN. This is a key distinguishing factor regarding what is a unique political and constitutional framework on the island of Ireland. As the Government has consistently said, the only way for us to influence this process and protect our national interests, including with regard to Northern Ireland and the common travel area, is to win the understanding and support of EU partners for Ireland’s unique concerns. From the outset, these concerns have been recognised as part of the negotiation guidelines, and we have achieved this understanding through the extensive programme of outreach and engagement undertaken with our EU partners. There will be a separate agreement on the UK’s future relationship with the EU, which is likely to cover a broad range of policy areas, including trade, and which is likely to take longer to conclude than the EU-UK exit agreement. Depending on the nature of this agreement, which is subject to negotiations, approval by each member state may be required in accordance with their own domestic procedures. It is also important to remember that the future relationship agreement will require ratification by all 27 member states, including Ireland. An EU-UK exit agreement will be approved by a majority in the European Council, therefore no one member state will be in a position to block or veto a deal. Even if it were possible to veto a deal, it would not mean that the UK would not leave because under Article 50, it would simply mean that the UK would depart without appropriate arrangements in place.	spk_271
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_25	"I will answer the last question first and the answer is ""Yes"". As the Deputy is aware from sitting very close to where Mr. Barnier spoke, this is one of the three priorities that needs to be dealt with. The first priority is the question of modalities and liabilities and the charge on the United Kingdom for leaving the European Union. This refers to a range of issues where contracts are in place or moneys are paid out of the European budget. There will be a difficulty in that if there is a €12 billion hole in the budget on a yearly basis, who is going to pay the extra or what programmes will be cut? Mr. Barnier stated that no country currently contributing to the European Union budget wants to pay any more and all of those in receipt of capital, grants and so on from the European Union do not want to receive any less. There will be a real problem if that is the scale of what is involved. The Deputy asked if the matter was discussed and it was. Mr. Barnier is a negotiator for Ireland and the Border is one of the first priorities. One of the second priorities relates to the rights of citizens and reciprocal rights for people from the UK living in the EU and  Deputy Howlin set out the position about the majority, equating to 72% of member states and 65% of the population. He is correct in that it would be a hollow victory. We do not want to have the case of negotiations coming to a finality at the European Council and finding ourselves stranded. That is why we have people on the negotiating task force who are in very close contact with our committee of permanent representatives to the EU, COREPER, and sherpa people in Brussels, so we know what is going on at all times in respect of the negotiating stances. I take the point of Deputies Howlin and Donnelly that it is very important for us in building those relationships to have our position cleared very early on. In fairness, most of the other European countries may not have as much interest as we do in Brexit because we are so close to Britain and for so many other reasons but they will become very interested if the hole in the budget will have an impact on programmes and structures in their countries. They might not have associated that with Brexit but if scheme X or Y is cut back or abolished altogether, people could become very interested politically. I agree with the sentiments that we need to do the work now and this will absorb so much political time from so many leaders over the next number of years. It need never have happened but it has happened."	spk_275
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_25	I made a very clear decision that we should not appoint a Brexit Minister as the European Council leaders are the ones who make the decision. The European Parliament must pass the outcome and the Singapore agreement also has an impact. These mixed agreements mean the European Union has competence in some areas but individual and regional parliaments must ratify the matters at the end of the day. We have some really good people operating in London, Brussels and throughout Europe generally. They are very competent and fully focused. Whoever is the new leader of the Fine Gael Party - I hope he will become Taoiseach, with whatever structure of Government is involved - will have at his disposal all that expertise on a constant basis and be really fully informed. It will be up to that person to build relationships with the individual leaders, who seem to change on a pretty regular basis at a European level. In my experience anyway, every second or third European Council meeting has another two or three people I might not have seen before because elections take place on a very regular and irregular basis throughout Europe. I wish the best to whomever the party selects as leader. I hope it will be a focus in putting together a Government.I will finish by saying-----	spk_277
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_25	-----the agenda for the European Union goes beyond Brexit. It also includes the Single Market, the digital single market, Economic and Monetary Union, opportunities to create jobs and for investment and very effective trade negotiations with other countries, including the United States and Canada and others towards the east, leading to the creation of millions of jobs. Brexit is not the be-all and end-all, but it is a real problem. While we must deal with it, we must also think beyond it	spk_279

#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_27	I can supply Deputy Martin with the audit he mentioned. I will forward him the numbers we have in terms of the appointments of diplomats and other staff who are working in different places. The Deputy made the point previously that it may become necessary to recruit or appoint people with particular experience, for instance, in trade and in the complex issues involved in that area. There is a willingness that when it becomes necessary, we can and will do that. When the issue was raised about Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, as I said, they look for particular types of people, but these negotiations have not started. Deputy Howlin is right on this. We still have a great deal of information to get from those with whom we will negotiate. Deputy Howlin made the point about knowing the thinking of people at a European level. From his experience and from that of Deputy Martin as a former Minister, it is about the building of relationships that last over a long period.	spk_259
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_27	At the end of the day, this Brexit business will have to be decided by the European Council and every country represented on it has a veto. If issues arise that are not acceptable, as I have no doubt they will-----	spk_261
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_27	It has got to be agreed at the European Council.	spk_263
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_27	Yes, but if somebody at the European Council will not accept the outcome of the deal, we will have a real problem. Deputy Howlin made a point about knowing the thinking of other European colleagues, and it takes time to build those relationships, but, as he is aware, it comes down to the European Council's decision, it is the Heads of Government who will make the ultimate decision. I take the Deputy's comments in the spirit that he made them. The presentation of our priorities, as we see them, without having all of the information in so far as what the British Government's thinking is on this, have been reflected in the Commission, Parliament and Council. However, as the Deputy pointed out, in terms of having as close as possible a working relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom, which is what we have now as a member of the European Union, that will be changed by virtue of the fact that the Single Market will be gone and the trading status will be changed. Therefore, when we go around that loop and come back to where we started we will be in a different position. Even if no tariffs will apply in terms of trade, we will still have two different jurisdictions and the complications that would involve are obvious. An Open Skies arrangement will have to be drawn up between the European Union and the United Kingdom, otherwise, aircraft will not be able to take off from here and land in London and go on to collect other passengers. That is an issue that needs to be dealt with and it is being worked upon now. We cannot wait for divorce to be concluded to do that.  The three issues identified by Michael Barnier here and agreed by Europe are the border, modalities and liabilities in terms of what the bill might be and the question of citizen's rights and reciprocal rights. All these matters, as was rightly said, were never put to the people in a way that they would have had a real discussion about understanding them. That is why our common travel area, which has been in place for 90 years covering travel, residence and the right to work and to draw social benefits, is a bilateral arrangement between Ireland and the UK and it is different with respect to rights of the Polish people or Lithuanians or Latvians who live in Great Britain. The European position is that if we want to have a parallel discussion begun, where we get into the meat of trade, we will have to make substantial progress in respect of the first three issues. I hear comments from some people across the water to the effect that progress will not be made on this, which clearly will lead to other complications.	spk_265
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_27	I take the Deputy's point. A no deal situation would be catastrophic for Ireland in, for example, the beef and agrifood sectors. Deputy Nolan spoke about the Brexit position. We did not cause this, we were not responsible for it and we did not want it but we have to deal with it. In respecting the vote of the British electorate, clearly, the issues that are priority have been set out for us. Dr. Pfeiffer is perfectly entitled to his opinion but this is decided at the European Council from a European point of view. One can have all the opinions, all the ideas and all the propositions one wants but at the end of the day, political leaders have to make decisions and the choices sometimes are not very palatable. That is why we were happy to get unanimous support from all the other 26 member states to say that Ireland's priorities are understood and Ireland's unique position is understood. We should remember that Brexit does not interfere with the Good Friday Agreement and we will not let it interfere with it. The Agreement was signed 19 years before Brexit ever became a reality.	spk_267
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_27	Thank you. In recognising the visionaries of the Good Friday Agreement, we have had support from Europe, in that, if the Agreement is ever implemented in full, that is, with a vote for consent by the democratic decision of people to join the Republic, the entire Island would be recognised as an entity of the European Union in full without having to reapply for membership.	spk_269
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_28	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 9, inclusive, together. We are confident that the European Council’s adoption of the EU’s negotiating guidelines on 29 April gives Ireland its strongest hand going into these complex negotiations. The unique circumstances of Ireland have been recognised as part of the negotiations from the outset.  The Government’s priority here has been to ensure that the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, including the Good Friday Agreement which already exists, are recognised and protected within the context of the Article 50 negotiations leading to a withdrawal agreement. The Good Friday Agreement is an internationally recognised treaty, legally binding and registered with the UN. This is a key distinguishing factor regarding what is a unique political and constitutional framework on the island of Ireland. As the Government has consistently said, the only way for us to influence this process and protect our national interests, including with regard to Northern Ireland and the common travel area, is to win the understanding and support of EU partners for Ireland’s unique concerns. From the outset, these concerns have been recognised as part of the negotiation guidelines, and we have achieved this understanding through the extensive programme of outreach and engagement undertaken with our EU partners. There will be a separate agreement on the UK’s future relationship with the EU, which is likely to cover a broad range of policy areas, including trade, and which is likely to take longer to conclude than the EU-UK exit agreement. Depending on the nature of this agreement, which is subject to negotiations, approval by each member state may be required in accordance with their own domestic procedures. It is also important to remember that the future relationship agreement will require ratification by all 27 member states, including Ireland. An EU-UK exit agreement will be approved by a majority in the European Council, therefore no one member state will be in a position to block or veto a deal. Even if it were possible to veto a deal, it would not mean that the UK would not leave because under Article 50, it would simply mean that the UK would depart without appropriate arrangements in place.	spk_271
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_28	"I will answer the last question first and the answer is ""Yes"". As the Deputy is aware from sitting very close to where Mr. Barnier spoke, this is one of the three priorities that needs to be dealt with. The first priority is the question of modalities and liabilities and the charge on the United Kingdom for leaving the European Union. This refers to a range of issues where contracts are in place or moneys are paid out of the European budget. There will be a difficulty in that if there is a €12 billion hole in the budget on a yearly basis, who is going to pay the extra or what programmes will be cut? Mr. Barnier stated that no country currently contributing to the European Union budget wants to pay any more and all of those in receipt of capital, grants and so on from the European Union do not want to receive any less. There will be a real problem if that is the scale of what is involved. The Deputy asked if the matter was discussed and it was. Mr. Barnier is a negotiator for Ireland and the Border is one of the first priorities. One of the second priorities relates to the rights of citizens and reciprocal rights for people from the UK living in the EU and  Deputy Howlin set out the position about the majority, equating to 72% of member states and 65% of the population. He is correct in that it would be a hollow victory. We do not want to have the case of negotiations coming to a finality at the European Council and finding ourselves stranded. That is why we have people on the negotiating task force who are in very close contact with our committee of permanent representatives to the EU, COREPER, and sherpa people in Brussels, so we know what is going on at all times in respect of the negotiating stances. I take the point of Deputies Howlin and Donnelly that it is very important for us in building those relationships to have our position cleared very early on. In fairness, most of the other European countries may not have as much interest as we do in Brexit because we are so close to Britain and for so many other reasons but they will become very interested if the hole in the budget will have an impact on programmes and structures in their countries. They might not have associated that with Brexit but if scheme X or Y is cut back or abolished altogether, people could become very interested politically. I agree with the sentiments that we need to do the work now and this will absorb so much political time from so many leaders over the next number of years. It need never have happened but it has happened."	spk_275
#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_28	I made a very clear decision that we should not appoint a Brexit Minister as the European Council leaders are the ones who make the decision. The European Parliament must pass the outcome and the Singapore agreement also has an impact. These mixed agreements mean the European Union has competence in some areas but individual and regional parliaments must ratify the matters at the end of the day. We have some really good people operating in London, Brussels and throughout Europe generally. They are very competent and fully focused. Whoever is the new leader of the Fine Gael Party - I hope he will become Taoiseach, with whatever structure of Government is involved - will have at his disposal all that expertise on a constant basis and be really fully informed. It will be up to that person to build relationships with the individual leaders, who seem to change on a pretty regular basis at a European level. In my experience anyway, every second or third European Council meeting has another two or three people I might not have seen before because elections take place on a very regular and irregular basis throughout Europe. I wish the best to whomever the party selects as leader. I hope it will be a focus in putting together a Government.I will finish by saying-----	spk_277

#EndaKenny	2017-05-30	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	Obviously, I am upset about this. The establishment of Tusla as the Child and Family Agency was part of the overall strategy of making children and the family central in Ireland, with the appointment of a senior Minister to the Cabinet, the establishment of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, holding of a referendum on children's rights and passing of subsequent legislation in various respects that would impact on society and social Ireland. Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, is funded by the taxpayer to a substantial amount. Last night's programme made for harrowing viewing, to say the least. It showed the unconscionable circumstances in which some children in this country found themselves. It is unacceptable. This is in the place, their home, where they are supposed to feel most loved, safe and valued. I believe I can speak for everybody here and every parent who watched in saying it was distressing viewing for parents. I say to the social workers who feel they are battling a system and the trainees who feel the same way that they should not be afraid to speak up and speak out. Many feel gagged and unable to speak the truth about what they know might be happening in some places. There are a number of criticisms made in the report, in the audit commissioned by the Garda and in the media coverage of it. They relate, in particular, to the out-of-hours social work service and the level of communication between Tusla and An Garda Síochána. It must be remembered that the period under review is 2008 to the end of 2015 and that there have been continuous improvements in the child protection area and Tusla operations since. Professor Shannon, whom I greatly respect, at the launch of the report on Monday, 29 May, expressed his full confidence in Tusla's child protection framework. On the out-of-hours social work service, a significant enhancement of the service took place in November 2015 and there is now a national service which facilitates 24-hour Garda contact with a social worker in cases where removal of a child under section 12 is being contemplated.There is emergency foster and residential care for a child removed from his or her family under this provision. As part of this service, social workers are available on the ground at night, over weekends and on bank holidays to assist An Garda Síochána in what are the busiest areas, namely, Dublin, Cork city, Kildare and Wicklow. In the remaining counties the volume of calls indicates that contact with Tusla social workers by telephone has been sufficient to date, but this is clearly under review. Some concerns have been expressed about the placement of such children in Garda stations and hospitals. I have been reassured that social admissions to hospital take place only in exceptional circumstances and only where a placement is for the child's own safety. Tusla does not request the Garda to keep a child over part of a night. That is a Garda decision. On the level of communication between Tusla and An Garda Síochána, I am informed that regular strategic liaison meetings take place at senior level to deal with the inadequacy pointed to.	spk_2
#EndaKenny	2017-05-30	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	As far as the Government and I are concerned, the issue should not be about the protection of the structure of Tusla but about the protection of children and accountability and transparency with regard to why the taxpayer puts money into Tusla in the first place. That should be evident to everybody. If that is not the case, we have to deal with the issue. My understanding - the Minister has obviously asked for a full report on it - is that work is already well under way on the many issues commented on by Dr. Shannon in his final report. Tusla will continue to roll out its national child care information system, which will significantly improve the information available on vulnerable children. I understand the Garda national child protection unit is carrying out an audit at local level of the child protection operations between Tusla and An Garda Síochána to see what is happening, or, perhaps more importantly, what is not happening. Divisional protective service units are being established in all 28 Garda divisions and effective liaison with Tusla will be a central feature of these units. Why not? In other places there are people who sit around the table from all of the various sectors to discuss these issues on a regular basis. A joint protocol is being finalised between Tusla and the Garda on the operation of section 12, which is an important section of the Act. This will provide clear and extensive guidance on a range of issues affecting children at risk. It will address many of the issues raised in the report by Dr. Shannon.  Best practice in child protection is evolving all the time. Research and reports like that of Dr. Shannon, commissioned by the Garda, provide a very necessary and valuable opportunity to review, reflect and strive to have an improved service.We are not finished with this at all. This has to be about the protection of children and not about the protection of the structure. I share the Deputy's view on that.	spk_4
#EndaKenny	2017-05-30	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	"I cannot disagree with the central issue of Deputy Adams's comments. This has to be about accountability and not about zero accountability. The Child and Family Agency was set up for a particular purpose as part of the response of Government to placing children and children's voices at the centre of Irish society, with a senior Ministry and Department dedicated directly to children. There was a referendum on children's rights and there is legislation, dealing which issues from sexual abuse to marriage equality, which have covered issues of family and children. The report by Dr. Shannon speaks for itself. It is a very good report, a damning report and a very clear report. He has made 27 recommendations, which must and will be followed through on. The Minister will meet the Minister for Justice and Equality to address the issue of communication between Tusla and An Garda Síochána. As Deputy Adams is aware, section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991 is an essential mechanism under which An Garda Síochána performs its child protection function and is only used as a measure of last resort. The Garda Commissioner must respond to the report in respect of the training of gardaí, including training for diversity, and the PULSE system and the deficiencies identified therein. Deputies will recall that the Government has already dedicated substantial resources for investment in Garda IT infrastructure. A total of €330 million, including €205 million in the capital plan, will be provided between 2016 and 2021. Members will appreciate that the design, commissioning and the delivery of such a large-scale IT project takes time and we must get it right in the first place.  The report comments on deficiencies in child protection training for gardaí, which is very concerning and needs to be seriously addressed. While the design of course provision is a matter for the Garda Commissioner in the first instance, I am advised that the current Garda student and probationer training programme incorporates modules that address issues like sexual assault and the Children First guidelines. The extent to which the existing training programme should be expanded or amended on foot of Dr. Shannon's recommendations must be addressed by the Garda Commissioner and An Garda Síochána in their response to his report.  While acknowledging the serious issues raised for An Garda Síochána in the report, it is worth noting that there have been a number of important developments in Garda structures, including the establishment of the Garda National Protective Services Bureau and the creation of the divisional protective services units. I am advised that it is also proposed to create a national child protection unit within An Garda Síochána so some things are happening. My answer to Deputy Adams's question about whether this will receive a whole-of-Government response is ""Yes"". The answer to the question about whether we will undertake to fulfil the 17 recommendations made by Dr. Shannon is also ""Yes"". "	spk_6
#EndaKenny	2017-05-30	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I did not have time to say it previously but the Garda Commissioner's modernisation and renewal programme from 2016 to 2021 and the policing plan for this year contain a commitment to implement a new Garda diversity and inclusion strategy. I understand that this is expected to be finalised shortly.I am advised that the new Garda strategy will embrace the recommendation from the Ombudsman for Children, arising from its review of the manner in which the Garda Síochána invoked its powers under section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991 with regard to two Roma children, which was an issue of national public discussion and concern some time ago. As part of this work, the Garda Síochána is committed to further training its workforce to develop its cultural competence in interacting with minority communities. I will finally say to the Deputy that in so far as my tenure continues here, I will see to it that this is initiated in respect of children. We have done so much in terms of preparations, and one of the central features of the child strategy issue has been the setting up of the Child and Family Agency, Tusla. We want to see that this is enabled to do its work properly and, as I said to Deputy Micheál Martin, the central issue here is about the protection of children, not the protection of jobs or the protection of a structure. I will see that this happens.	spk_8
#EndaKenny	2017-05-30	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I am not happy about the situation that has arisen here. I am pleased that Dr. Shannon's report is as authentic and straightforward as it is. Tusla was the agency that said that it would be a ferocious corporate parent, looking after children. There are clearly questions to be answered here as to what was happening with public time, public money and public employees when children, as identified in this programme, were in the situation and circumstances in which they found themselves. I thank Deputy Howlin for his comment about being serious about this. It is a case where this structure will, like all other structures, seek to defend itself. The result is that vulnerable children are in very serious circumstances in some cases. It is our responsibility to see that everything humanly possible is done to put that right and if that requires further answers from Tusla, then so be it. As I said to Deputy Martin, this is not about zero accountability; it is about full accountability in respect of the most important people in the country who are our children. I want to meet the principals involved here. I want to speak to Dr. Shannon and to Tusla. I also want to speak to both Ministers. We cannot have a situation where there is a lack of engagement between the authorities and the agencies involved, the Garda and Tusla. I remember attending the launch of Tusla in Dublin Castle with the then Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and we put forward the proposition that Tusla was a radical step forward in the protection of children. Dr. Shannon's report points out serious inadequacies and we have to deal with those. I undertake to do so.	spk_10
#EndaKenny	2017-05-30	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I fully agree. It is about the change of the culture here. The culture has been one of defence and structural protection. The purpose and focus of Tusla was to deal with children and the protection of children and the care and the comfort and facilities for children. As Deputy Howlin rightly says, we should not have to wait for any rapporteur's report to know what is happening here. If there are inadequacies between the Garda communications and Tusla, then I will rectify that. If this requires regular political oversight and monitoring, let us rectify that. One cannot have children living in fear in urine-soaked clothes in situations where they deserve the protection and the support of the State. There is nothing more important than this. I thank Dr. Shannon for his report, but let us see that the 17 recommendations are implemented. I will be speaking to both the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, but also to Tusla. I am not happy about this. It goes to the central issue here. This is about changing a culture from one of protection of structure and jobs to one of protection of children.	spk_12
#EndaKenny	2017-05-30	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	The central point the Deputy makes is that the Government has failed to act on this issue but I disagree. I believe that Mr. Justice Charleton is the most appropriate person to carry out the required investigation. He has already adopted an absolutely no-nonsense approach to dealing with the business before him. He has set out the timelines, the strategy and the focus of public hearings. Deputy Barry has come into this House with a report from a journalist that a phone is missing that was in the possession of the Garda Commissioner. I do not know whether that is true or whether it is an allegation that stands up but I expect that Mr. Justice Charleton will find out the truth of that. He has already pointed out that public hearings on this matter will take place in July. Obviously he is a person of long experience, having worked on the Morris tribunal and having dealt with matters as complex as this in the past. He is the very best person to deal with the matter. I reject the Deputy's assertion that the Government has not done anything about this. The Government has set up a full formal commission of investigation under a very competent sole member to deal with the matter. The terms of reference of the tribunal are comprehensive and Mr. Justice Charleton will not stand on ceremony in getting to the truth of the issue. I would be loath to accept what the Deputy has said because I do not have any idea whether it is true. It is an allegation and a report. I would much prefer to leave the determination of the facts and the truth to Mr. Justice Charleton. I have every faith that he will discharge his duties and responsibilities to the utmost level of satisfaction.	spk_14

They include Sergeant Maurice McCabe; Superintendent David Taylor, who is a former Garda press officer; the Garda Commissioner; and the former Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan. According to the interim report, the Garda Commissioner and the former Garda Commissioner have agreed to waive privilege in respect of records in their possession. A slate of public hearings on this matter will be held in July of this year under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Charleton. That is the place where the accuracy, the veracity and the truth will be established.

#EndaKenny	2017-05-30	dail	32	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_7	I propose to take Questions No. 1 to 6, inclusive, together. Having regard to the confidential nature of the work of the national security committee, it would not be appropriate to disclose information about the dates of individual meetings or about its proceedings. The committee is chaired by the Secretary General to the Government and comprises representatives at the highest level of the Departments of Justice and Equality, Defence and Foreign Affairs and Trade, and of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces.  It is concerned with ensuring the Government and I are advised of high level security issues and the responses to them, but not with operational security matters. The committee meets as required and will continue to do so. In addition to the meetings, the members liaise on an ongoing basis to monitor developments that might have national security implications, in particular in the international arena. As regards the meeting of 25 May, its purpose was to review the State's arrangements and level of preparedness in the event of a major terrorist attack. As well as the Tánaiste and me, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, the Minister for Health, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister of State at the Department of Defence and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment attended, with the Garda Commissioner, the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces and senior officials. The meeting was briefed on the current threat assessment by the security authorities. It was noted that while a terrorist attack was possible, it was unlikely and that there was no specific information on any threat to Ireland from international terrorism. This assessment will remain under continuous review. The authorities remain in daily contact with their counterparts in the United Kingdom, the European Union and beyond. The Garda authorities, supported by the Defence Forces, are engaged in ongoing work aimed at preventing an attack taking place. Detailed preparations have also been made in the event of an attack. Other agencies also have plans in place to deal with the outcome of major incidents. Ministers were also briefed on the overall national emergency management arrangements, involving all of the agencies of the State, and how the arrangements would operate in the event of a major incident. The meeting was advised that the Garda authorities were working closely with event organisers to ensure appropriate safety and security measures were in place at major events. The Garda is asking the public to remain vigilant and report immediately any issue which gives rise to concern. Of equal importance is ongoing work to ensure people do not become alienated from our society and radicalised. Terrorism is caused not by particular religions or peoples but by hatred. The aim of international terrorism is to change our way of life through creating fear. We cannot and will not allow that to happen. It is important that we abide by our values and continue to live our lives to the full in a free society.	spk_124
#EndaKenny	2017-05-30	dail	32	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_7	This is probably one of the most serious matters that can ever be considered here. There are some things one can say and some things one cannot say. Facilities at Shannon Airport have been used for many years by members of the US Air Force, but I have no evidence of rendition flights through it. Deputy Mick Wallace has been there on a number of occasions. Deputy Gerry Adams has stated we cannot consider ourselves to be immune. That is true and there is no complacency. The weapons of bombers have changed and are changing. Clearly, the incidents in France, Belgium, Berlin and Sweden lead us to believe this. There is now the capacity to take remote control of a vehicle and drive it at speed into a crowd of people, with or without a driver. More primitive weapons are being used to carry out the same destruction, leading to international incidents. The question of having a separate security group or force has been raised. I am not sure we want an MI5 or an MI6 here, but the O'Toole commission which is examining the structure, policing and security matters, as raised by Deputies Mícheál Martin, Brendan Howlin and Joan Burton, can consider the matter in a way which allows us to reflect a very dangerous and changing world.  As Deputy Mícheál Martin is aware, the Defence Forces obviously have intelligence available to them on small numbers of people who might be in the country for purposes other than peaceful living. They are under review on a constant basis. That intelligence is made available to the Garda and shared on a very regular basis. Clearly, the Garda and the security forces generally are in constant touch, or daily contact, with Britain, the rest of Europe and beyond, where necessary. Deputy Mícheál Martin referred to the slaughter of innocent victims. While all cases are tragic, one of the differences is that suicide bombers want to be blown up. The Provisional IRA did not want that to happen. It caused the same destruction and no warnings were given and people suffered tragic consequences. The preparations for a serious incident here have covered and do cover a range of options, about which I cannot speak. No matter where one puts the cordon of security, however, people have to gather outside it to get in and these are always issues of grave concern. I expect the O'Toole commission to examine the issue of security or a security element-----	spk_132
#EndaKenny	2017-05-30	dail	32	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_7	As the Deputy is aware, we have had enough discussion here about the structure of the Garda to get it right. If there is to be a second element, which may well be worthwhile, that is another matter. I do not want to prejudge the expertise available to the O'Toole commission. The evolution through the independent Policing Authority and the changes with GSOC and the Garda Inspectorate will all lead to a change in culture in the Garda over a number of years. Whether it would be right to have a second intelligence and security element is a matter I do not want to prejudge, but it is working well in other countries. We have had our own system. Obviously, there have been inadequacies that we are trying to rectify. Radicalisation has been mentioned. It is not a religious issue. The Garda has the capacity to engage with different and diverse communities to understand what is happening and what is likely to be of interest to us. There is a lot of activity in that area. Deputy Mícheál Martin mentioned people coming back to Ireland having fought with ISIS. As I said, there is a small number of people in the country who are certainly under scrutiny.  Deputy Joan Burton raised the question of having an intelligence agency. It will certainly be an element of the focus of the O'Toole commission. I do not want to prejudge it. Let us get the system we have in place right. I assure Members that at the meeting I attended with representatives of the Garda, the Defence Forces and the health, transport and aviation sectors they informed me that they were all very active in looking out for potential incidents that might occur here. The sharing of information is important. It is quite complex and very complicated in terms of the information stored on servers here with major companies. Privacy and the protection of data are very strongly valued by them, yet we have to share information with our UK colleagues who might see potential terrorists passing through Britain, including to case a place with the intention of carrying out an incident later. That is a matter we have to deal with through legislation, which is very complicated. At the same time, we have to and do share information on potential terrorists with our colleagues across the water. That is an issue that is being focused on by the Department of Justice and Equality.	spk_134

#EndaKenny	2017-05-30	dail	32	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_7	Go easy on me now. I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 9, inclusive, together. In A Programme for a Partnership Government, the Government stated its intention to reform Seanad Éireann and committed to pursuing implementation of the report of the working group on Seanad reform, the Manning report. That report was published in 2015 and is available on the Department's website. One of the recommendations of the report was the establishment of an implementation group to oversee implementation of the reforms contained in the report.  As I said previously, I agreed with a suggestion made here some time ago by Deputy Micheál Martin that this group should be based in the Oireachtas and should comprise members of the Dáil and Seanad from all parties and groups, with access to independent expert advice as required. I wrote to party leaders in September last year seeking their agreement to this approach and their intention to participate. Contacts are still continuing with parties to finalise nominations with a view to having the group up and running as soon as possible.	spk_140
#EndaKenny	2017-05-30	dail	32	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_7	I admit that I am guilty of not having put this together. We had questions in the House on 22 February. At that time, I said that there was a dispute over who would chair the group. I think Deputy Martin had one nominee and I had another. Let me renew my activities to see if we can get a chair and get it set up. I would like to do that. Deputy Howlin asked me when the next election is going to be and whether anything will happen before then. I am not sure when that is going to happen actually.	spk_147

#EndaKenny	2017-05-30	dail	32	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_7	I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 17, inclusive, together. I met with Mr. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator for Brexit, in Government Buildings on Thursday 11 May. I was accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the Minister of State for European affairs. The meeting provided an opportunity, following the European Council's adoption of the EU negotiating guidelines and in advance of agreement on the more detailed negotiating directives, to thank Mr. Barnier for his openness to Ireland in relation to our particular concerns arising from Brexit and to highlight our thoughts about the process ahead. We discussed the serious implications in relation to peace and stability in Northern Ireland and the Border, and for the Irish economy, particularly the fisheries and agrifood sector. I commended Mr. Barnier on his address to the Oireachtas that morning and expressed confidence in his ability to negotiate on behalf of the EU 27 and to take account of Ireland's particular concerns.  Mr. Barnier stressed the complexities of the issues involved in the negotiations and outlined his intention to be firm but fair. He committed to ensuring that the task force remains accessible to all Member States and especially to Ireland, given our unique concerns.  There is ongoing daily engagement on Brexit and on other EU issues between the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and, indeed, with the permanent representation in Brussels and our network of missions across the EU, with a view to ensuring a comprehensive approach to EU affairs. There is also of course ongoing interaction across all Government Departments on the range of EU issues, including through regular meetings of the senior officials group on the EU and the inter-departmental group on Brexit, which is chaired by the second Secretary General in my Department.  This is consistent with the approach set out in my Department's statement of strategy, which identified the need for a whole-of-government approach to the Brexit negotiations.  The second Secretary General also acts as Ireland's sherpa and, in this capacity, meets and engages regularly with his EU counterparts. Since the triggering of Article 50 on 29 March, there have been two formal sherpa meetings under the Article 50 format, one on 11 April and another on 24 April. Ireland participated fully in both of these.  The discussions focused on the EU negotiating guidelines, which were subsequently agreed by the European Council on 29 April.  The negotiations on Brexit, which will be conducted by the Commission, will be guided by the European Council in its Article 50 format, that is, the heads of state and government of the 27 member states.  In addition, Ministers at the General Affairs Council now also discuss issues relating to Brexit in the Article 50 format.At official level, the Committee of Permanent Representatives in the European Union, COREPER, and the new working party are also meeting at 27 to discuss issues relating to Brexit. COREPER meets on a weekly basis. The new working party first met on 23 May and it is expected to meet twice a week from now on. Of course, there are also daily meetings of working groups on the full range of EU issues and these groups include representatives of all member states, including Ireland. 	spk_151
#EndaKenny	2017-05-30	dail	32	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_7	Deputy Burton raised the question of AIB. The Minister for Finance has taken a lead role on this. Under EU fiscal rules, the proceeds of any sale may not be used to fund increased expenditure irrespective of whether such expenditure is classified as current or as capital. On the accounting treatment of any proceeds from such a transaction, the position is that the sale of such financial assets does not result in a beneficial impact to the general Government balance under EUROSTAT rules. This is because it is classified as a financial transaction whereby it is essentially the exchange of one form of assets, such as shares, for another kind, such as cash. Consequently, the sale of any share-holding in a bank would not count as general Government revenue, and would not create any scope for increased spending on the basis of the proceeds that are realised. There will be no increased capacity for spending following any sale of bank shares. The Minister for Finance will make his decision on this matter in the next 48 hours.	spk_166

#EndaKenny	2017-05-30	dail	32	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_7	-----cash proceeds from the sale of bank shares would result in a reduced requirement for Exchequer borrowing, which ultimately results in lower debt. A lower debt level is not only beneficial for the fiscal sustainability of the State, but will also lead to reduced interest payments in future years. It is crucial that increases in funding for public investment are based on sustainable economic growth, and the Government is well aware of the challenges that arose in the past when one-off amounts of money were used to fund ongoing commitments to the State.	spk_172
#EndaKenny	2017-05-30	dail	32	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_7	"Deputy Gerry Adams raised the question of papers produced by Mr. Barnier in respect of citizens' rights. We are engaged with Brussels and London on a daily basis about all of these matters. The Government will respond to the papers and they can be debated here. I note the Deputy's comment about Mr. Colum Eastwood, MLA, and the united Ireland referendum. I do not believe that the conditions are right for it at the moment but I was happy that the European Council reflected carefully on the visionaries who put their words together on the Good Friday Agreement such that, if that process ever happens and people decide to have a democratic vote by consent to join the Republic, the entire island becomes a full member of the European Union, irrespective of the decision to leave as part of Britain under the Brexit negotiations. Deputy Brendan Howlin raised the question of the EU agencies here. Clearly, Ireland has applied for both of them, as other countries have. These are European agencies that will be based in a European country. We are competing with Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Luxembourg for the financial one and with other countries for the medical agency and we will compete strongly for those. We tick many of the relevant boxes. That will eventually be decided by the European Council, probably in the autumn. Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly raised the level of meetings in the negotiations. These negotiations have not begun at all yet. All we are doing is setting out the strategy and groundwork, and we have those principles established. When the Deputy says that the IDA and Enterprise Ireland have not taken up all of the approved numbers, they will be employed as needs be, and outside expertise will be employed if necessary. The negotiations have not begun in detail yet. The Deputy also spoke about what he termed ""mounting materiality"", which is not a common phrase used down in the country, I have to say. Deputy Seán Haughey mentioned co-ordination between Departments. There is co-ordination on a daily basis. On having a Minister with responsibility for Brexit, I made the point before that the decisions are made by the European Council. If a Brexit Minister was appointed, he or she could not even attend the General Affairs Council, which makes the initial preparatory decisions before they go to the European Council. Let us say that Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett becomes the Brexit Minister, he cannot attend the General Affairs Council, he cannot attend at the European Council-----"	spk_174

At the end of the day, it is the European Council. Deputy Boyd Barrett raised the matter of the veto. We have a veto because it has to be approved eventually by the entire European Council. Ireland has a veto, along with every other country if they so wish, and that is contained clearly within the rules and regulations. If at the end of the day, when it is all over and done with, and a proposition comes - the European Parliament will have its say - to the European Council, if Ireland is not in agreement, Ireland has a veto, the same as everybody else-----	spk_176

#EndaKenny	2017-05-30	dail	32	National Security Committee	dbsect_8	I propose to take Questions No. 1 to 6, inclusive, together. Having regard to the confidential nature of the work of the national security committee, it would not be appropriate to disclose information about the dates of individual meetings or about its proceedings. The committee is chaired by the Secretary General to the Government and comprises representatives at the highest level of the Departments of Justice and Equality, Defence and Foreign Affairs and Trade, and of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces.  It is concerned with ensuring the Government and I are advised of high level security issues and the responses to them, but not with operational security matters. The committee meets as required and will continue to do so. In addition to the meetings, the members liaise on an ongoing basis to monitor developments that might have national security implications, in particular in the international arena. As regards the meeting of 25 May, its purpose was to review the State's arrangements and level of preparedness in the event of a major terrorist attack. As well as the Tánaiste and me, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, the Minister for Health, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister of State at the Department of Defence and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment attended, with the Garda Commissioner, the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces and senior officials. The meeting was briefed on the current threat assessment by the security authorities. It was noted that while a terrorist attack was possible, it was unlikely and that there was no specific information on any threat to Ireland from international terrorism. This assessment will remain under continuous review. The authorities remain in daily contact with their counterparts in the United Kingdom, the European Union and beyond. The Garda authorities, supported by the Defence Forces, are engaged in ongoing work aimed at preventing an attack taking place. Detailed preparations have also been made in the event of an attack. Other agencies also have plans in place to deal with the outcome of major incidents. Ministers were also briefed on the overall national emergency management arrangements, involving all of the agencies of the State, and how the arrangements would operate in the event of a major incident. The meeting was advised that the Garda authorities were working closely with event organisers to ensure appropriate safety and security measures were in place at major events. The Garda is asking the public to remain vigilant and report immediately any issue which gives rise to concern. Of equal importance is ongoing work to ensure people do not become alienated from our society and radicalised. Terrorism is caused not by particular religions or peoples but by hatred. The aim of international terrorism is to change our way of life through creating fear. We cannot and will not allow that to happen. It is important that we abide by our values and continue to live our lives to the full in a free society.	spk_124
#EndaKenny	2017-05-30	dail	32	National Security Committee	dbsect_8	This is probably one of the most serious matters that can ever be considered here. There are some things one can say and some things one cannot say. Facilities at Shannon Airport have been used for many years by members of the US Air Force, but I have no evidence of rendition flights through it. Deputy Mick Wallace has been there on a number of occasions. Deputy Gerry Adams has stated we cannot consider ourselves to be immune. That is true and there is no complacency. The weapons of bombers have changed and are changing. Clearly, the incidents in France, Belgium, Berlin and Sweden lead us to believe this. There is now the capacity to take remote control of a vehicle and drive it at speed into a crowd of people, with or without a driver. More primitive weapons are being used to carry out the same destruction, leading to international incidents. The question of having a separate security group or force has been raised. I am not sure we want an MI5 or an MI6 here, but the O'Toole commission which is examining the structure, policing and security matters, as raised by Deputies Mícheál Martin, Brendan Howlin and Joan Burton, can consider the matter in a way which allows us to reflect a very dangerous and changing world.  As Deputy Mícheál Martin is aware, the Defence Forces obviously have intelligence available to them on small numbers of people who might be in the country for purposes other than peaceful living. They are under review on a constant basis. That intelligence is made available to the Garda and shared on a very regular basis. Clearly, the Garda and the security forces generally are in constant touch, or daily contact, with Britain, the rest of Europe and beyond, where necessary. Deputy Mícheál Martin referred to the slaughter of innocent victims. While all cases are tragic, one of the differences is that suicide bombers want to be blown up. The Provisional IRA did not want that to happen. It caused the same destruction and no warnings were given and people suffered tragic consequences. The preparations for a serious incident here have covered and do cover a range of options, about which I cannot speak. No matter where one puts the cordon of security, however, people have to gather outside it to get in and these are always issues of grave concern. I expect the O'Toole commission to examine the issue of security or a security element-----	spk_132
#EndaKenny	2017-05-30	dail	32	National Security Committee	dbsect_8	As the Deputy is aware, we have had enough discussion here about the structure of the Garda to get it right. If there is to be a second element, which may well be worthwhile, that is another matter. I do not want to prejudge the expertise available to the O'Toole commission. The evolution through the independent Policing Authority and the changes with GSOC and the Garda Inspectorate will all lead to a change in culture in the Garda over a number of years. Whether it would be right to have a second intelligence and security element is a matter I do not want to prejudge, but it is working well in other countries. We have had our own system. Obviously, there have been inadequacies that we are trying to rectify. Radicalisation has been mentioned. It is not a religious issue. The Garda has the capacity to engage with different and diverse communities to understand what is happening and what is likely to be of interest to us. There is a lot of activity in that area. Deputy Mícheál Martin mentioned people coming back to Ireland having fought with ISIS. As I said, there is a small number of people in the country who are certainly under scrutiny.  Deputy Joan Burton raised the question of having an intelligence agency. It will certainly be an element of the focus of the O'Toole commission. I do not want to prejudge it. Let us get the system we have in place right. I assure Members that at the meeting I attended with representatives of the Garda, the Defence Forces and the health, transport and aviation sectors they informed me that they were all very active in looking out for potential incidents that might occur here. The sharing of information is important. It is quite complex and very complicated in terms of the information stored on servers here with major companies. Privacy and the protection of data are very strongly valued by them, yet we have to share information with our UK colleagues who might see potential terrorists passing through Britain, including to case a place with the intention of carrying out an incident later. That is a matter we have to deal with through legislation, which is very complicated. At the same time, we have to and do share information on potential terrorists with our colleagues across the water. That is an issue that is being focused on by the Department of Justice and Equality.	spk_134

#EndaKenny	2017-05-30	dail	32	Seanad Reform	dbsect_9	Go easy on me now. I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 9, inclusive, together. In A Programme for a Partnership Government, the Government stated its intention to reform Seanad Éireann and committed to pursuing implementation of the report of the working group on Seanad reform, the Manning report. That report was published in 2015 and is available on the Department's website. One of the recommendations of the report was the establishment of an implementation group to oversee implementation of the reforms contained in the report.  As I said previously, I agreed with a suggestion made here some time ago by Deputy Micheál Martin that this group should be based in the Oireachtas and should comprise members of the Dáil and Seanad from all parties and groups, with access to independent expert advice as required. I wrote to party leaders in September last year seeking their agreement to this approach and their intention to participate. Contacts are still continuing with parties to finalise nominations with a view to having the group up and running as soon as possible.	spk_140
#EndaKenny	2017-05-30	dail	32	Seanad Reform	dbsect_9	I admit that I am guilty of not having put this together. We had questions in the House on 22 February. At that time, I said that there was a dispute over who would chair the group. I think Deputy Martin had one nominee and I had another. Let me renew my activities to see if we can get a chair and get it set up. I would like to do that. Deputy Howlin asked me when the next election is going to be and whether anything will happen before then. I am not sure when that is going to happen actually.	spk_147
#EndaKenny	2017-05-30	dail	32	Seanad Reform	dbsect_9	There is a confidence and supply agreement and all the rest of it. Politics has a peculiar way of moving things along.

#EndaKenny	2017-05-30	dail	32	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_10	I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 17, inclusive, together. I met with Mr. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator for Brexit, in Government Buildings on Thursday 11 May. I was accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the Minister of State for European affairs. The meeting provided an opportunity, following the European Council's adoption of the EU negotiating guidelines and in advance of agreement on the more detailed negotiating directives, to thank Mr. Barnier for his openness to Ireland in relation to our particular concerns arising from Brexit and to highlight our thoughts about the process ahead. We discussed the serious implications in relation to peace and stability in Northern Ireland and the Border, and for the Irish economy, particularly the fisheries and agrifood sector. I commended Mr. Barnier on his address to the Oireachtas that morning and expressed confidence in his ability to negotiate on behalf of the EU 27 and to take account of Ireland's particular concerns.  Mr. Barnier stressed the complexities of the issues involved in the negotiations and outlined his intention to be firm but fair. He committed to ensuring that the task force remains accessible to all Member States and especially to Ireland, given our unique concerns.  There is ongoing daily engagement on Brexit and on other EU issues between the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and, indeed, with the permanent representation in Brussels and our network of missions across the EU, with a view to ensuring a comprehensive approach to EU affairs. There is also of course ongoing interaction across all Government Departments on the range of EU issues, including through regular meetings of the senior officials group on the EU and the inter-departmental group on Brexit, which is chaired by the second Secretary General in my Department.  This is consistent with the approach set out in my Department's statement of strategy, which identified the need for a whole-of-government approach to the Brexit negotiations.  The second Secretary General also acts as Ireland's sherpa and, in this capacity, meets and engages regularly with his EU counterparts. Since the triggering of Article 50 on 29 March, there have been two formal sherpa meetings under the Article 50 format, one on 11 April and another on 24 April. Ireland participated fully in both of these.  The discussions focused on the EU negotiating guidelines, which were subsequently agreed by the European Council on 29 April.  The negotiations on Brexit, which will be conducted by the Commission, will be guided by the European Council in its Article 50 format, that is, the heads of state and government of the 27 member states.  In addition, Ministers at the General Affairs Council now also discuss issues relating to Brexit in the Article 50 format.At official level, the Committee of Permanent Representatives in the European Union, COREPER, and the new working party are also meeting at 27 to discuss issues relating to Brexit. COREPER meets on a weekly basis. The new working party first met on 23 May and it is expected to meet twice a week from now on. Of course, there are also daily meetings of working groups on the full range of EU issues and these groups include representatives of all member states, including Ireland. 	spk_151
#EndaKenny	2017-05-30	dail	32	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_10	Deputy Burton raised the question of AIB. The Minister for Finance has taken a lead role on this. Under EU fiscal rules, the proceeds of any sale may not be used to fund increased expenditure irrespective of whether such expenditure is classified as current or as capital. On the accounting treatment of any proceeds from such a transaction, the position is that the sale of such financial assets does not result in a beneficial impact to the general Government balance under EUROSTAT rules. This is because it is classified as a financial transaction whereby it is essentially the exchange of one form of assets, such as shares, for another kind, such as cash. Consequently, the sale of any share-holding in a bank would not count as general Government revenue, and would not create any scope for increased spending on the basis of the proceeds that are realised. There will be no increased capacity for spending following any sale of bank shares. The Minister for Finance will make his decision on this matter in the next 48 hours.	spk_166
#EndaKenny	2017-05-30	dail	32	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_10	The Minister informed the Government of his process to this point. He expects he will keep Government informed and that he expects to make a decision in the next 48 hours.	spk_168

#EndaKenny	2017-05-30	dail	32	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_10	-----cash proceeds from the sale of bank shares would result in a reduced requirement for Exchequer borrowing, which ultimately results in lower debt. A lower debt level is not only beneficial for the fiscal sustainability of the State, but will also lead to reduced interest payments in future years. It is crucial that increases in funding for public investment are based on sustainable economic growth, and the Government is well aware of the challenges that arose in the past when one-off amounts of money were used to fund ongoing commitments to the State.	spk_172
#EndaKenny	2017-05-30	dail	32	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_10	"Deputy Gerry Adams raised the question of papers produced by Mr. Barnier in respect of citizens' rights. We are engaged with Brussels and London on a daily basis about all of these matters. The Government will respond to the papers and they can be debated here. I note the Deputy's comment about Mr. Colum Eastwood, MLA, and the united Ireland referendum. I do not believe that the conditions are right for it at the moment but I was happy that the European Council reflected carefully on the visionaries who put their words together on the Good Friday Agreement such that, if that process ever happens and people decide to have a democratic vote by consent to join the Republic, the entire island becomes a full member of the European Union, irrespective of the decision to leave as part of Britain under the Brexit negotiations. Deputy Brendan Howlin raised the question of the EU agencies here. Clearly, Ireland has applied for both of them, as other countries have. These are European agencies that will be based in a European country. We are competing with Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Luxembourg for the financial one and with other countries for the medical agency and we will compete strongly for those. We tick many of the relevant boxes. That will eventually be decided by the European Council, probably in the autumn. Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly raised the level of meetings in the negotiations. These negotiations have not begun at all yet. All we are doing is setting out the strategy and groundwork, and we have those principles established. When the Deputy says that the IDA and Enterprise Ireland have not taken up all of the approved numbers, they will be employed as needs be, and outside expertise will be employed if necessary. The negotiations have not begun in detail yet. The Deputy also spoke about what he termed ""mounting materiality"", which is not a common phrase used down in the country, I have to say. Deputy Seán Haughey mentioned co-ordination between Departments. There is co-ordination on a daily basis. On having a Minister with responsibility for Brexit, I made the point before that the decisions are made by the European Council. If a Brexit Minister was appointed, he or she could not even attend the General Affairs Council, which makes the initial preparatory decisions before they go to the European Council.

#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I agree with Deputy Micheál Martin. Despite all the criticism of and cynicism about politics, at least there is political answerability in the sense that a Minister in charge of something like this would face instant dismissal. The situation is that this person has been acquitted and is not guilty of any offence. As a result, the taxpayer takes up all the costs involved. The indications given by Judge Aylmer are very clear, as the Deputy has pointed out. The ODCE is a statutory independent body. Its mother Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, has no responsibility or power of enforcement. The ODCE takes its own legal advice. There were gardaí attached to the ODCE in the beginning but they were not involved in the way this case was taken. The judge did point out that the most fundamental error was the way in which they went about taking evidence from the auditors of Anglo Irish Bank, who were both from the firm of accountants involved. He said that it was intended that their statements would be taken in the normal way by members of the Garda Síochána who were then attached to the ODCE. Instead, however, the statements were obtained through solicitors from a legal firm. The ODCE pointed out that it has now undergone substantial organisational change and that it was simply not equipped to undertake parallel investigations on the scale involved. I want to say this: I have not spent the past six years as head of Government and making very difficult decisions only to hear again now the allegation in respect of white-collar crime that people can walk away, that nobody is guilty and that nothing is being done about it.	spk_2
#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	Let us, as a Parliament, decide what we must do with an organisation like the ODCE. I can confirm that when the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, had responsibility for jobs, requests by the ODCE to his then Department for resources were granted. Now I find that the ODCE says it was simply not equipped to take parallel investigations on the scale involved. I can confirm that the Minister has asked the Director of Corporate Enforcement for a full report, including on the role of all professionals involved in this case. That report will cover the issues involved since 2008 when this case commenced - almost ten years ago. Nothing is ruled out. When Deputy Catherine Murphy had her full group, she put forward a proposition for a statutory standing body in the Dáil to deal with matters of corruption and so on.The Minister will bring this before Government in due course. The Government will consider it next week, but I want the Minister to carry out an absolute review of what happened. It is not good enough. I agree with Deputy Micheál Martin. We cannot have a situation where an independent statutory agency that does not take legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General proceeds on its own and seeks resources from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. Despite provision of the latter, this trial collapsed. We know why the first trial collapsed.	spk_4
#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	We heard the condemnation of a judge yesterday who had said that this case cannot proceed any further.	spk_6
#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	The Government will consider the matter on Tuesday next. The Minister will bring her report in due course. I would expect representatives from the ODCE to go before the relevant Oireachtas committee as well.	spk_8
#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	Yes, the Minister will come before the Dáil, make a full statement and answer all questions in so far as she can at this point. Two things are important in this instance. First, the ODCE is an entirely independent statutory authority. Therefore, it is not subject to Government direction. Second, the trial was under way. While concerns were being raised, it would not have been possible to interfere with a trial that was under way in the courts. The comments made by Judge Aylmer speak for themselves. They are an indictment of the ODCE. The ODCE had some success in 2014 and 2016. In April of this year, a person was arrested and charged with fraudulent trading based on an invoice relating to a fraud and entered a plea of guilty. I think that the ODCE looked for resources and expertise, in so far as I can understand this, and that those requests were granted. When the ODCE says that it was simply not equipped to undertake parallel investigations on the scale involved, one would have thought that there would have been a specific request for the capacity to take in necessary expertise or whatever, either through Government or from outside sources, to deal with parallel investigations. In any event, it was not possible for Government to intervene in any way in a pending court case and was not possible for Government to give directions to an independent statutory body. Since the current director was appointed, quite a number of changes have taken place. That does not deal with the fact that this case has gone on for ten years and is one of the longest and most expensive in the history of the State. The taxpayer has to pick up the tab here because the person who was acquitted yesterday has already been declared bankrupt. The Minister will come before the Dáil, make a statement, give a report and answer questions on this. She is to receive a full and detailed report from the Director of Corporate Enforcement-----	spk_15
#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	-----and keep people fully informed -----	spk_17

#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	Deputy Adams makes the point that there was not a seriousness about the investigation. The point is-----	spk_22
#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	-----that this office was set up to oversee companies and to deal with those that stepped out of line. It has its independence and statutory authority and therefore it was not subject, and is not subject, to direction by the Minister or the Government, although it was set up by the Government for a very specific purpose. When the current director was appointed with effect from August 2012, the ODCE's investigation on the FitzPatrick case had been completed and the file passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The scale and complexity of the investigation into the affairs of Anglo Irish Bank was unprecedented in the history of the State, as Deputy Micheál Martin pointed out. In light of the complexities of modern corporate law enforcement, the current director has overseen a number of organisational improvements in the ODCE.Those improvements include reorganising the structures of the office, recruiting additional expertise, most notably five forensic accountants, because clearly in the determination of the case in the first place the forensic analysis was not strong enough. A digital forensic specialist is due to begin with the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement in the coming weeks. Fundamentally, it has amended the investigative procedures used by the office with members of the Garda Síochána now taking the lead on all criminal investigations. This is where there has clearly been a weakness in the system. While the ODCE may deal with civil cases at a lower level, when it comes to serious criminal law, we need to be able to deal with it with serious criminal forensic intent. That obviously was not what was followed here, as outlined by Judge Aylmer in his comments yesterday. There have been a number of successful prosecutions. Clearly, the judge has made a decision. The trial is over and Mr. FitzPatrick is a free man. The taxpayer takes up the tab here. The Minister has requested a full and detailed report from the director of the ODCE. The Minister will come before the Dáil, make her statement and answer questions. The director is prepared to go before the appropriate Oireachtas committee. The Government will reflect on this next week and when the report from the director becomes available to the Minister, it will be published and made available for everybody. We need to reflect on the fundamental question here. 	spk_24

I am informed the European Space Agency supports over 2,000 high-tech jobs in Ireland, with increasing employment and funding when it is necessary.	spk_28
#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	Judge Aylmer made the point the ODCE completely lost sight of the nature and extent of the evidence on guilt and innocence. It completely lost sight of what was involved. The Deputy said there is no robust legislation in place here. In 2014 two gentlemen were convicted for the giving of unlawful financial assistance by Anglo for the purchase of its own shares. In 2016 both of them were convicted for fraudulent trading on foot of a plea of guilty. The second conviction was for failing to maintain a bank register of loans to directors on foot of a plea of guilty. The law in those cases actually worked in respect of white-collar crime. The Deputy mentioned comments made by the then Minister in 2015.When the current director was appointed in 2012, the investigation of the FitzPatrick case had been completed. It is in the space before the current director was appointed that the judge made his damning comments in regard to the structure and management capacity of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, at that time. I would expect that when Mr. Drennan appears before the Oireachtas committee, he will provide every detail necessary to point out the changes in structure that apply now. The question is whether the ODCE is now fit for purpose or whether we need to clarify where the criminal law kicks in.	spk_35
#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	The Deputy mentioned that the investigative procedure should be thorough, accurate and convincing and everybody supports that.	spk_37
#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	Clearly, the position that applied with the investigation carried out by the ODCE in the FitzPatrick case was none of those.The judge himself made the point, which is a damning indictment of the procedure that was followed here, that the ODCE had completely lost sight of the nature and the extent of the evidence in respect of guilt and innocence. Everybody before the Irish courts is innocent until proven guilty. Now, the longest running trial in the history of the State has collapsed, the central individual is now free and acquitted and the taxpayer must take up the tab. All of these issues - a lack of procedural capacity, lack of investigative capacity and lack of forensic analysis competence - were all evident in the structure of the ODCE prior to the current director being appointed in August 2012 where serious changes have taken place. The Minister will outline that to the Dáil and take questions on it. Director Drennan will be happy to go before the Oireachtas committee and have a serious discussion about it. The Government will reflect on this next week. The Minister will produce and publish the report when it is made available to her by the director. The Minister, Deputy Noonan, and the Government have already commented on the IPO in respect of a portion of AIB being sold on and being applied to the reduction of debt. He has already made the point that it is a paper transfer in terms of whatever the value of the 25% being offered amounts to. The Government is not under any pressure to deal with this because the question of infrastructure is one it is now considering in terms of the capital review. All of the extent of the capital programme at the moment is up to €42 billion between State agencies, PPPs and the Exchequer. Yesterday, I pointed out the scale of what is available that is as yet unallocated, which is now the subject of a review here. It is also important, as Deputy Howlin is well aware, that we do not want a situation where we apply so much money to infrastructure that all of the inflation costs then result and developers continue to make the rewards from all of that. It is much more important that the infrastructural needs are dealt with, and we are able to deal with these. Yesterday, both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform were in Europe talking to the European Investment Bank about a number of major infrastructural projects, which can be accommodated through lending from the EIB at low interest rates long term. Issues have already been mentioned, like the development of the metro, like the development of the major motorway from Cork to Limerick and others where potentially there is a stream of income that can come from those to pay off those loans. I respect the fact that the House made a decision last week in respect of a matter in regard to AIB, but Deputy Howlin will also respect the right and the responsibility of Government to make its decisions, and this decision has been publicly announced by Government for quite a long time and will stand in the context of what Government is doing.	spk_39
#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I am glad the Deputy is using his office as leader of his party to talk to others internationally. That is part of an important negotiation in which Ireland has always been involved in order that others fully understand our position. It is applied in the case of Brexit and the main priorities for our country. I hope the Germans have listened carefully to what the Deputy had to say. We voted for the fiscal stability treaty.	spk_41
#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	We voted for the rules here in a referendum, the only country to do so in the middle of a recession, and we voted 60:40 for that. The Deputy is right that it is not about the question of money being available; it is about the extent of how much we can spend. That is a very valid point, and I take that point. In the context of setting out what it is we can do in terms of infrastructure development, we need to consider that.	spk_43
#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	For example, the Government put €5 billion on the table in respect of social housing and we are struggling to get local authorities to measure up to the requirements. We gave them the money to buy houses, to reconstruct houses, to build houses and to have private enterprise come onto public lands to build social housing. It is a real challenge.	spk_45
#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	Many of the developments, such as the Gort-Tuam project and the Rosslare bypass, are under way. These are major developments. The point the Deputy makes about the extent of fiscal space and the capacity to spend money is an issue we are considering and will continue to consider. The question about AIB is a decision we have already made as a Government and we will follow through on it. The question of flexibility is a matter the Minister, Deputy Noonan, is dealing with all of the time.	spk_49
#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	The Deputy is a decent man too. I respect his right to raise in the House any issues he feels strongly about. When the predecessor to this Government was elected, we were blocked out of all the international markets, bond yields were at 15%, the unemployment rate was 15.2%, we were haemorrhaging jobs by the ten thousands, and there was despair and disillusionment all over the place. Now, because of the sacrifice of the people, that has changed considerably. We are now able to borrow money for the State at less than 1%. The unemployment rate is down to 6.3% or 6.4% and is heading in the right direction. More than 225,000 jobs have been created since the Minister, Deputy Bruton, introduced the first Action Plan for Jobs. The Deputy referred to the recruitment of nurses. The Minister, Deputy Harris, has addressed this on a number of occasions. There are now incentives for nurses. Permanent contracts are offered to all new nurses coming out of highly specialised training here in Ireland. There are opportunities for nurses to return home to work in the hospital service here in Ireland. Not everybody will do that. Young people in all walks of life tend to move to other countries for experience in travel and to develop their skills. The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, has been working very hard on the issue of mental health. Yesterday she went to the Linn Dara facility where only half of the 22 beds are occupied. During her visit she was given assurances that any patients discharged from the Linn Dara facility are children who are discharged for clinical reasons only. The HSE confirmed to the Minister of State that no young person will be discharged unless deemed clinically appropriate by their mental health team. Nobody is being discharged to allow a bed to be closed. The HSE has also assured the Minister of State that for patients who are discharged for clinical reasons, dedicated follow-on support is available from the community-based child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS. They will continue to be provided as required on a routine basis. The Health Service Executive will also increase the capacity of the child and adolescent mental health day services during the summer to enhance the level of support available for those children and their families. The core issue facing the Linn Dara facility relates specifically to staff recruitment difficulties for mental health professionals, which unfortunately, as the Deputy has pointed out, reflects wider health system recruitment and retention issues. I assure the Deputy that the problem facing the Linn Dara facility does not relate to funding availability but to staffing availability. Intensive efforts are under way to increase staffing to allow more beds to be reallocated. The HSE is actively engaged in a recruitment process, with a number of staff due to support the service in the near future. I hope that will improve things. An allocation of €15.5 billion is now going into the health services. All nurses coming out of Irish training institutions are offered permanent contracts giving them the opportunity to work at home here in our own hospitals.	spk_51
#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I am very proud of the people of this country for responding to an unprecedented economic crisis in a way that has made us the envy of many in Europe and has left us with the fastest growing economy in the European Union for the past four years running.	spk_53
#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I admit that we have many challenges ahead but the changes that have been brought about have put the country in a much safer position than was the case previously.	spk_56
#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	No doubt Deputy Gino Kenny has spoken to many constituents who have been treated by the health service and who have nothing but praise for the doctors, nurses and attendants who looked after them. The problem has always been to get into the system and to have the capacity to deal with that. That is why the Government has treated the health service as a priority, why €14.5 billion has been allocated and why changes are constantly being made through primary care centres, home-care packages and the provision of community care teams to look after people. In respect of the payment situation the Deputy made for nurses, the same arguments are made for gardaí, members of the Defence Forces, teachers, public servants and others. Those talks are now beginning in full with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the trade unions. The Minister hopes to engage intensively in those talks now with a view to concluding them by the end of June, and getting an extension of the Lansdowne Road agreement where benefits were won and agreed with the unions involved. In respect of the matter relating to pensions, I will, when I leave this seat, continue to be paid as a backbench Deputy.	spk_58
#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_3	It is a valid question. I read the reports to which Deputy Micheál Martin refers and, from what I understand, the perpetrator's family came from northern Africa in order to live in Manchester in England.That has been replicated in a number of other locations here. These savage acts of terrorism were carried out by people from local bases. When one considers any event, concert or major sporting occasion in any country or here, no matter where one puts the perimeter of security people must congregate and move to where the event actually takes place and this movement is always outside of that perimeter. I have looked at the situation and have called a meeting for 7.30 a.m. tomorrow of all the agencies in defence, justice, transport and health. We will look at the situation in Ireland. I was very impressed with the immediate response to the tragedy of the first responders in Manchester.	spk_65
#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_3	The Deputy raised a couple of important points. When the O'Toole commission gets going it will look at security in policing. There is an issue as to whether or not we should have a security and intelligence unit as a separate structure and how it currently operates. We will reflect on that. It is important for the Government of the day to give assurance to people that everything humanly possible is being done and put in place to protect the innocent people and citizens of our country.	spk_67
#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_3	We will do that and we will share the information as far as we can with the House because it is important to get this right.	spk_69
#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_3	While we cannot proceed on the basis that everything is calm and rosy and that nothing could happen here, the levels of security are at moderate which means that it is possible but not likely.	spk_71

#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_3	As I understand it, the Department of Health commenced its policy review of A Vision for Change, beginning with an evidence-based expert review of international evidence of best practice and of existing service development. This was completed in February of this year and will inform the next stage of the policy review process. A review of the Mental Health Act 2001 is also being progressed. I do not have the intended date of publication but I will advise the Deputy of it. She also asked about the oversight committee. I will come back to her on both of those issues, if I may.	spk_87
#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_3	"The Deputy referred to the scrutiny of Bills, which is right and proper. He also referred to the process as ""stuff"". The pre-legislative scrutiny of Bills is very important and enables all Deputies elected to this House to have their say about what might, should or should not be in any particular Bill. The scrutiny to which the Deputy referred is very important. I have had a letter from the Ceann Comhairle requesting that I meet him and the chairpersons of the committees to discuss the question of the process for Private Members' Bills, such as the Bill introduced by the Deputy, of which there are now 140 backed up."	spk_89
#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_3	Whatever the number is, they are delayed. The question is how to prioritise these Bills, including Deputy Kenny's Bill, in order that they can move through the process. I do not accept that there is an attempt to stymie the Bill, to delay it or not to have it put through. What happens is that a number of Private Members' Bills are accepted but when they go through to the next Stage, the Department or the Minister has to do an extensive amount of work on them to make them suitable for purpose, taking into account the original intent of the Private Members' Bill. The members of the committee are not subject to my direction.	spk_92

#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_3	Drogheda is a big town and is growing in size and population. The living city initiative is continually reviewed. We have tried different things in the past 30 or 40 years and have offered various incentives to different locations. There was tax relief, which entailed lines being drawn on different streets. That created its own problems as smart accountants were able to get around the legislation and build developments that were never thought of, while areas outside the delineations suffered. Many premises which are derelict and in need of repair are left that way by owners expecting a payday when the economic situation improves.That question also needs to be looked at. In the first instance, the local authority should prepare a programme justifying why the living city initiative should be extended to Drogheda. It should also point out the initiatives it is taking to improve the lot, perspective and definition in the aforementioned town. There should also be discussions with those who own derelict buildings. The council have a responsibility in that regard and it is not good enough that such buildings in town centres are left for 20 years to rot, fall down and be a disgraceful aspect when they could be put to far better use.	spk_105

#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_3	I believe in ConnectIreland and engaged with it in a very detailed way to get it set up. The theory was that people working abroad for different companies, which were considering investing in Europe, would ask that the companies consider investing in Ireland. If they did decide to invest in Ireland there would be a reward fee for the director to the country here, provided that the jobs were sustainable and that they actually became a reality. It has worked reasonably well in small areas that would not be the focus of the IDA. While it might provide four, ten or 20 jobs in those areas, they had the potential to grow. There were discussions between ConnectIreland and the IDA. There was the question of re-tendering contracts. I cannot provide the up-to-date detail as of today but I will find out. The plan was worth following. It has produced a number of jobs, perhaps not as many as expected, but nonetheless it was important for rural Ireland.	spk_131

#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_3	These measures have been a success, as Deputy McLoughlin is aware. I hope the facilities that have been committed to from Tralee to the Athlone and in the western region will be marketed by IDA Ireland and will attract interest from direct investors into the country. Approximately 1,500 jobs are being created each week. As broadband capacity and the infrastructure opportunity are rolled out, it makes it much more attractive for jobs to be created outside the greater Dublin region. As the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor has pointed out on a number of occasions, the Government's decision has been to invest in creating the vast majority of jobs outside the greater Dublin region in terms of IDA Ireland. That approach is backed up by Enterprise Ireland's being able to expand many of the firms that export at the moment. Deputy McLoughlin's local facility in Sligo is being presented and promoted by IDA Ireland and I hope that process will be successful soon.	spk_148
#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Cabinet Committee Meetings	dbsect_5	I travelled to Canada between 3 and 6 May. This was the first visit to Canada by a serving Taoiseach in more than a decade and it provided an opportunity to develop and strengthen the important bilateral relationship between our two nations, which share deep historic ties and enjoy strong trading relations. Over the centuries, Canada has been an important destination for Irish immigrants. Today, over 4.5 half million Canadians - more than 14% of the country's population – claim direct Irish ancestry. During my visit I had a series of engagements with political, business and civic society representatives in Montreal and Toronto and met a number of existing and potential new IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland client companies. These engagements provided very useful opportunities for me to promote Ireland as a location for trade and investment, as well as to emphasise our commitment to the EU and outline Ireland's priorities in the context of Brexit. While in Montreal, I met Prime Minister Trudeau. We discussed the trade relationship between Ireland and Canada and Ireland's strengths as a location for trade and investment into Europe. We also considered ways to further strengthen the economic and trade relationship between our two countries, and agreed to prioritise the opportunities offered by the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA. I also updated the Prime Minister on Ireland's Brexit priorities and outlined to him the current position in Northern Ireland. The Prime Minister reiterated to me the Canadian Government's continued support for the Northern Ireland peace process. Members will be aware of the part played by John de Chastelain in decommissioning terrorist arms in that process. Also in Montreal, I attended a business lunch with senior members of the Montreal business community at which I met potential and current investors in Ireland. I also visited the school of Irish studies at Concordia University where I met members of the Irish diaspora. In Toronto, I addressed an Enterprise Ireland event and an event hosted by the Ireland Canada Chamber of Commerce, both of which provided me with opportunities to meet current and potential investors in Ireland. I addressed a Tourism Ireland event and visited Ireland Park, the Irish Famine memorial in Toronto, which is a magnificent site. I also paid a courtesy call on the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, Elizabeth Dowdeswell. My programme concluded with a meeting with members of the board of the Irish Canada Immigration Centre and other representatives of the Irish diaspora and an event with representatives of the Ireland Fund in Canada.  This was a very successful visit which I believe will provide a platform to further strengthen the bilateral relations between Ireland and Canada. I expect relations will be further enhanced during the trade mission to Canada that will be led by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, from 30 May to 2 June.	spk_154
#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Cabinet Committee Meetings	dbsect_5	I discussed CETA with the Canadian Prime Minister, Mr. Trudeau. Actually, as Deputy Howlin is aware, Canadian views are very much in line with Irish views on the benefits of trade agreements and the benefits of properly used globalisation for jobs. They are keen to have the agreement operate in the interests of both countries. Some 50% of foreign direct investment from Canada goes directly to Britain. Since the United Kingdom is moving out of the European Union and the Single Market, this is clearly an opportunity for this business to thrive. I gather there are now flights from Montreal, Toronto and St. John's to Ireland on a weekly, if not daily, basis. I think four airlines are coming in. They are keen on that. The agreements provide a range of sectoral opportunities for Irish companies in Canada in financial software, telecommunications, digital technology, agricultural machinery, life sciences and medical devices. CETA was signed on 30 October 2016 in Brussels by representatives from Canada, EU and member states. The EU and Canada have also agreed a legally binding agreement, a joint interpretative instrument, which has been added to CETA to provide further assurances in respect of public services, labour rights, environmental protection and investment. A number of steps remain to be taken on both sides before this becomes fully operational. Meanwhile, aspects of CETA will be provisionally applied by both sides beginning, I hope, this summer. The provisional application of the trade agreement is a standard process in agreements of this sort. It allows those parts of the agreement for which the EU has competence to come into force, including reductions in tariffs on our exports, which will apply to 99% of exports. However, the provisions of CETA relating to investment protection will be excluded from provisional application. The European Parliament voted in favour of the provisional application of CETA in February. The process of ratification is now commencing in member states. Canada is now finalising its internal implementation procedures to allow for ratification. I understand that Canadian Senate approval was secured on 11 May and the Bill now awaits royal assent. I spoke to Canadians about beef, which was an issue here with the Irish Farmers Association. Canada is allowed 15,000 tonnes under the original agreement. Canada finds this difficult to meet because most beef from Canada goes the other way – it goes west to Asia. CETA increases that but it will be difficult for Canadians to meet that level.	spk_156

#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Cabinet Committee Meetings	dbsect_5	The question of refugees was raised. Canada is looking for more people. Those who cross the border from the United States, other than at formal crossings, are received with open arms and are being housed. They include 40,000 Syrians. The community in Ballaghaderreen has responded. They are making wonderful efforts to integrate our Syrian refugee people.	spk_167
#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Cabinet Committee Meetings	dbsect_5	The reason that erupted was that the Italian people were suggesting that we should take refugees or people without any vetting.

#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Cabinet Committee Meetings	dbsect_5	I agree. We will have a debate on free trade with Canada in respect of the Deputy's request. I will see that it happens. It is a very good thing. For the Deputy's information, the provisional application is a standard part of trade agreements and allows those parts of the agreement on which the EU has competence to proceed. CETA provides for provisional application, as the process for ratification across all member states may take a number of years. In Ireland's case, the Dáil will be part of the final decision, which is not what the Deputy was talking about there but a debate on the benefits of free trade. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has observed many times that we export Irish agricultural products to over 180 countries and that is where our strength is built, the Deputy rightly points out. The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation supports the provisional application as it allows for Irish medium-sized enterprises to export tariff-free to Canada. Finally, I point out that 38,000 emigrants from Ireland - immigrants to Canada - went to Toronto in 1847, when the population of that city was only 20,000. They were welcomed with open arms. I want to commend Robert Kearns and his people on the wonderful memorial they have built on the shores of the lake there to those Irish emigrants. They are now moving to commemorate the medics who worked with people from the Irish community, many of whom died from diseases such as typhoid and cholera. This is an important debate which we will have.	spk_181
#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Cabinet Committee Meetings	dbsect_5	I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 5, inclusive, together. Last July, the Government launched a major initiative for the Dublin north inner city with the establishment of a ministerial task force to oversee the long-term social and economic regeneration of the area. At the time of the launch a number of short-term measures were announced to help the community address some of the immediate challenges facing it and these are mostly completed, having been progressed by the responsible Departments and agencies. This has resulted in €1 million invested in sports and youth projects in the area, €700,000 spent on local community projects targeting children and youth, including some drug projects. A further €3 million has been spent on improvement works to the area, including roads, housing areas, parks and lighting and refurbishment of the Sean McDermott swimming pool. Further investment will take place in response to the publication of Kieran Mulvey's independent report in February and the Government's agreement to implement his recommendations in full. The first step has been the establishment in the local area of the programme implementation office with staff assigned from Dublin City Council. In addition, the Secretary General of my Department established an oversight group last month to oversee preparatory work across a number of Departments. The next step is for the ministerial task force, which I chair, to appoint an independent executive chairperson who will lead the work and engage with community structures and local residents. That person will be based in a premises and office in the north inner city.	spk_182
#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Cabinet Committee Meetings	dbsect_5	A number of things are important here. The Mulvey recommendations said to set up a north inner city programme implementation board, a north inner city programme office, a new community consultative forum and a local programme working group. The programme implementation office has been established in the area and has commenced work on a number of actions. An independent executive chairperson, referred to by Deputy Howlin and others, will have the lead responsibility for the programme implementation board. I expect that person to be appointed very shortly and hopefully we can do it before I leave this seat.	spk_187
#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Cabinet Committee Meetings	dbsect_5	The person will be based in the north inner city working closely with community groups, as Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan and Deputy Haughey said, and with Dublin City Council in making these arrangements. Once appointed, arrangements for the remaining board to include community representation will be finalised. A meeting of the community consultative forum will convene following appointment of the chair to ensure there is ongoing wider community participation and feedback on various aspects of the programme. The Secretary General of my Department has established an oversight group to support the work of the ministerial task force and to ensure these actions are monitored and implemented. That group held its first meeting on 6 April and discussed progress and a list of actions from the Mulvey report. It is expected to meet again today. Some of the things that have happened are €1 million was invested in sports and youth projects, a multi-use games pitch in Sheriff Street community centre, a fit-out of the new premises for Ballybough boxing club, improvement works to pitches at Sheriff Street youth club and Larkin Community College. Small grants and equipment were distributed to about 40 local youth groups and sports clubs and a local GAA and soccer coaching programme was supported. I was glad to see the Deputies out at Scoil Uí Chonaill in Clontarf the other day. A full-time local sports co-ordinator was employed to make the most of the local facilities and get people involved. There was €700,000 spent on community projects targeting children, including the successful Bally Mac Sheriff Halloween festival, local library and school based projects targeting reading and digital skills, the Brighter Futures restorative practice projects across two age groups in the area and funding for third level access programmes. There were 15 local drugs projects supported and grants to support local arts projects and men's sheds community garden project, which were all very successful. There was €3 million spent on the physical improvement of Ballybough House and Courtney Place, Ballybough and road resurfacing works at Sean McDermott Street, Railway Street, Cumberland Street North, James Joyce Street, Beaver Street and Buckingham Street Upper to improve the physical aspect of the place. There were improvement works in Mountjoy Square and Portland Place park and internal and external refurbishing of the Sean McDermott Street pool. I congratulate former chief superintendent Leahy who was appointed by the independent Policing Authority to be assistant commissioner. He was a superb policeman, really on top of his job and I hope his successor will do the same. Deputy Haughey raised the issue of gangland crime and the checkpoint. It is unnerving but necessary, given the situation that has applied there for some time. The Garda Commissioner is overseeing the operation of the Garda special crime task force to enhance the response to organised crime. The task force has been in operation since July 2016, has made serious inroads and has a big success rate. Operation Hybrid was established to co-ordinate the response to violent crime in the area and address public concerns about community safety. Operations are reviewed on a weekly basis to maintain that kind of impetus. The Government has approved an extra €55 million for An Garda Síochána to assist in a number of initiatives including concentrated policing which targets gang-related crime. Obviously we will look at the question of Fitzgibbon Street Garda station being opened. It is an iconic building and there is work to be done there. I will go down there on Monday with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, to look at many of these projects. Joe Costello and others are all welcome to turn up in the afternoon.	spk_189

#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Cabinet Committee Meetings	dbsect_5	Deputy Micheál Martin is right that the outcome of Brexit will have profound implications. There is no denying that as this is a totally new situation. When Article 50 was written, no one envisaged that a country would decide to leave the European Union. This has happened, however. In addition, the British Government, in respecting the wish of the electorate, has decided to remove the UK from the Single Market. A changed situation arises in respect of the trading negotiations. It is true that we export 90% of what we produce. Some elements involved in addressing this will be to have a much stronger concentration on the eurozone and arrange trade missions to sell the agricultural and food products we produce. The agriculture sector is already under pressure. As Deputy Micheál Martin is aware, currency fluctuations mean we are down €500 million in six months. Our response has been to provide low interest, longer-term loans and increase the capacity of Enterprise Ireland to further assist exporting companies.	spk_196
#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Cabinet Committee Meetings	dbsect_5	No, €500 million was lost as a result of fluctuations in the value of sterling. In respect of the European Medicines Agency and European Banking Authority, we have applied to have both agencies relocate here and we are obviously in competition with other countries. The matter will go through the normal process and will come before the European Council for final decision in the autumn. There are major implications and opportunities for whichever location is chosen. Ireland has made a case for hosting both organisations and we will compete with many other countries. Deputy Adams referred to customs controls. The official who spoke at the joint committee last week was referring to hypothetical scenarios. We have an agreement politically that there will be no return to the Border of the past. Nobody wants to have a situation such as that which applied at the Killeen crossing and right along the Border for years and which brought with it, as Deputy Adams is aware, sectarian violence and militarisation. As I stated previously, if, arising from the Brexit discussions, tariffs are not applied to goods moving between the Republic and Britain or Britain and the rest of Europe, we will still have two different jurisdictions and a way will have to be found to deal with that. What we agreed with the British Government and Mr. Michel Barnier, who addressed the Dáil only a short time ago while standing next to where Deputy Adams is seated, was that the solution will have to be creative and imaginative. The independent members of the Revenue Commissioners will say that they may well have a job to do here and will look at the different options. However, the committee also agreed that it is not clear what will be the outcome. What is clear is that there is a political  Designated status is an issue I have always referred to in the sense of our particular and unique circumstances, which were outlined to the House by the chief negotiator on behalf of the European Union when he referred to our citizens, economy, jobs and relations with the United Kingdom, the protection of the common travel area, our place in Europe and the fact that we do not want to return to what we had before. We unreservedly condemn the latest atrocity in Manchester. I was glad to hear the First Minister, Ms Arlene Foster, express the hope the other day that an Executive would be formed. While there are political differences, it is important that the Executive faces in the direction of the future and we will be able to have the North-South Ministerial Council, the cross-Border agencies and the development of infrastructure into the North, which are very important for the future.  I will have to revert to Deputy Howlin with some detail on the matter he raised. I do not want to lead him astray but I think the issue is related to the arrival in Ireland of a great deal of intellectual property from corporate firms, which caused a spike in the figures.	spk_198

#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_6	I travelled to Canada between 3 and 6 May. This was the first visit to Canada by a serving Taoiseach in more than a decade and it provided an opportunity to develop and strengthen the important bilateral relationship between our two nations, which share deep historic ties and enjoy strong trading relations. Over the centuries, Canada has been an important destination for Irish immigrants. Today, over 4.5 half million Canadians - more than 14% of the country's population – claim direct Irish ancestry. During my visit I had a series of engagements with political, business and civic society representatives in Montreal and Toronto and met a number of existing and potential new IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland client companies. These engagements provided very useful opportunities for me to promote Ireland as a location for trade and investment, as well as to emphasise our commitment to the EU and outline Ireland's priorities in the context of Brexit. While in Montreal, I met Prime Minister Trudeau. We discussed the trade relationship between Ireland and Canada and Ireland's strengths as a location for trade and investment into Europe. We also considered ways to further strengthen the economic and trade relationship between our two countries, and agreed to prioritise the opportunities offered by the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA. I also updated the Prime Minister on Ireland's Brexit priorities and outlined to him the current position in Northern Ireland. The Prime Minister reiterated to me the Canadian Government's continued support for the Northern Ireland peace process. Members will be aware of the part played by John de Chastelain in decommissioning terrorist arms in that process. Also in Montreal, I attended a business lunch with senior members of the Montreal business community at which I met potential and current investors in Ireland. I also visited the school of Irish studies at Concordia University where I met members of the Irish diaspora. In Toronto, I addressed an Enterprise Ireland event and an event hosted by the Ireland Canada Chamber of Commerce, both of which provided me with opportunities to meet current and potential investors in Ireland. I addressed a Tourism Ireland event and visited Ireland Park, the Irish Famine memorial in Toronto, which is a magnificent site. I also paid a courtesy call on the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, Elizabeth Dowdeswell. My programme concluded with a meeting with members of the board of the Irish Canada Immigration Centre and other representatives of the Irish diaspora and an event with representatives of the Ireland Fund in Canada.  This was a very successful visit which I believe will provide a platform to further strengthen the bilateral relations between Ireland and Canada. I expect relations will be further enhanced during the trade mission to Canada that will be led by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, from 30 May to 2 June.	spk_154
#EndaKenny	2017-05-24	dail	32	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_6	I discussed CETA with the Canadian Prime Minister, Mr. Trudeau. Actually, as Deputy Howlin is aware, Canadian views are very much in line with Irish views on the benefits of trade agreements and the benefits of properly used globalisation for jobs. They are keen to have the agreement operate in the interests of both countries. Some 50% of foreign direct investment from Canada goes directly to Britain. Since the United Kingdom is moving out of the European Union and the Single Market, this is clearly an opportunity for this business to thrive. I gather there are now flights from Montreal, Toronto and St. John's to Ireland on a weekly, if not daily, basis. I think four airlines are coming in. They are keen on that. The agreements provide a range of sectoral opportunities for Irish companies in Canada in financial software, telecommunications, digital technology, agricultural machinery, life sciences and medical devices. CETA was signed on 30 October 2016 in Brussels by representatives from Canada, EU and member states. The EU and Canada have also agreed a legally binding agreement, a joint interpretative instrument, which has been added to CETA to provide further assurances in respect of public services, labour rights, environmental protection and investment. A number of steps remain to be taken on both sides before this becomes fully operational. Meanwhile, aspects of CETA will be provisionally applied by both sides beginning, I hope, this summer. The provisional application of the trade agreement is a standard process in agreements of this sort. It allows those parts of the agreement for which the EU has competence to come into force, including reductions in tariffs on our exports, which will apply to 99% of exports. However, the provisions of CETA relating to investment protection will be excluded from provisional application. The European Parliament voted in favour of the provisional application of CETA in February. The process of ratification is now commencing in member states. Canada is now finalising its internal implementation procedures to allow for ratification. I understand that Canadian Senate approval was secured on 11 May and the Bill now awaits royal assent. I spoke to Canadians about beef, which was an issue here with the Irish Farmers Association. Canada is allowed 15,000 tonnes under the original agreement. Canada finds this difficult to meet because most beef from Canada goes the other way – it goes west to Asia. CETA increases that but it will be difficult for Canadians to meet that level.	spk_156

Sanction has been given and money provided to recruit 114 assistant psychologists to enhance the early intervention primary care counselling services for under 18s in particular and to relieve pressure on the specialist CAMH service. The development of a plan for a 7/7 mental health care improvement nationally has been progressed and is nearing completion. It has prioritised that all areas provide access to a weekend service for current service users and not have situations where nobody has access to a service if he or she needs it. A full mapping exercise is being carried out countrywide. The HSE, at present, is consulting with all of the personnel in the health sector area and assessing the resource implications to develop costed actions. In addition, of course, the construction of the new 120-bed hospital to replace the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum after over a century, along with a new ten-bed forensic CAMHS unit and a new ten-bed mental health intellectual disability unit, has been advanced. The Minister expects to sign that contract very shortly. Award of the construction contract is due to happen quite quickly. It has been recently agreed that in addition, the contract will also include a new 30-bed intensive care rehabilitation unit. These are all positive signs of progress in an area that was neglected for so many years and was, over 30 years, the Cinderella of many Health Service Executive Votes and Department of Health Votes. When former Deputy Dan Neville was in opposition on that side of the House, he raised this matter consistently. I am glad that the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, is making valiant efforts to deal with this. Funding for this area includes youth mental health, improvement of the CAMHS and the adult services, services for older people, out-of-hours services, enhanced service user and carer engagement, perinatal mental health, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, in adults and children, dual diagnosis of those with mental health and substance abuse issues, increased services to meet the needs of those with severe and enduring mental illness with complex presentations and improved specialist clinical responses through clinical programmes. Deputy Martin raised a specific case in respect of 11 beds. I do not have the details of that here, but I will undertake to follow up on that for him. I know it is an issue of concern locally, and Deputy Browne might have referred to that. Believe me, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, is working very hard in this area. The improvements I have outlined are long overdue and it is hoped they will make a significant improvement for the health, in particular the mental health, of children and young adults.	spk_3
#EndaKenny	2017-05-23	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	Let me clear up a few things for Deputy Martin. First, intensive efforts are under way to maintain the services at Linn Dara CAMHS unit at Cherry Orchard, Ballyfermot. The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, is in regular and very close contact with the HSE in regard to the particular difficulties of providing adequate staffing, and meetings are under way this very afternoon. Clearly, however, there are staffing difficulties at this facility. At present, the unit is reliant on providing cover through methods such as staff working additional hours, overtime and agency staff. However, the core issue facing Linn Dara at present relates specifically to staff recruitment difficulties for mental health professionals. I pointed out to the Deputy that 160 have been recruited from January to March this year and an additional 114 assistant psychologists have been approved and are now under recruitment. Let me clear this up for Deputy Martin. The problem facing Linn Dara does not relate to funding availability or the restructuring of any of the CAMHS services.	spk_15
#EndaKenny	2017-05-23	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	Let me assure people that any discharges from Linn Dara are clinical decisions and are planned discharges. No individual will be discharged to close beds. Let us be clear about that. The HSE is actively engaged in a recruitment process for Linn Dara and is meeting this afternoon. It is exploring every option to ensure this excellent service remains fully operational.	spk_17
#EndaKenny	2017-05-23	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	As I said, there has been an increase in moneys and the number of staff this year. Further approval has been given and no child is being sent out of Linn Dara because of either funding difficulties-----	spk_19

#EndaKenny	2017-05-23	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	It is a question of staffing difficulties. Anybody discharged is a planned, clinical discharge.	spk_25
#EndaKenny	2017-05-23	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I have already referred to the Linn Dara situation where a meeting is taking place this afternoon. Sanction has been given for the recruitment of personnel already from January to March this year, including a further 114 assistant clinical psychologists. The difficulty with the Linn Dara facility is not funding but is a question of staffing difficulties. Serious efforts are being made today on a continuing basis to deal with that matter. I hope it can be dealt with conclusively and positively. It is not a case of the usual claim of a shortage of money. Some 1,100 new posts have been provided for mental health and sanctioned and filled between 2012 and 2016. There was additional substantial funding of more than €115 million. Budget 2017 provided further additional funding for mental health, which means that the HSE funding for this key care programme will increase from €826 million in 2016 to more than €850 million this year. In budget 2017, an additional €35 million was allocated for services to be initiated in 2017. The Deputy is talking about north Louth, which, no more than any other part of the country, still has inadequate services. The range of what I have outlined, which is of particular to the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, is evidence of the Government's continuing commitment to dealing with this. The Deputy mentioned A Vision for Change. A review of the 2001 Act is under way.As I mentioned to the Deputy last week, some points made by Deputy Browne are being taken into account. In line with A Programme for a Partnership Government, the Department recently commenced a policy review of A Vision for Change. This began with the evidence-based expert review of international best practice and existing service development. The latter was completed in February of this year and it will inform the next stage of a policy review process and that will take into account the review of the Mental Health Act. The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, chairs a task force that comprises a diverse group of 18 people from a number of different mental health sectors - public, private, community and voluntary. The task force has a balance of age, gender and diversity and is an action-focused group which has been meeting monthly over the past year. As part of the Minister of State's commitment to ensuring that the voices of children and young people are at the very heart of the work of the task force, a series of consultations with young people themselves has now commenced. The task force and the public consultation process organised by the Minister of State are very active. The detail of what the Deputy referred to in north Louth is a matter on which I can follow up. The overall picture is one of increasing funding and approval, sanction and recruitment of qualified staff to provide the best level of service for children and young people on a 7/7 basis so that nobody is left without attention when they need it.	spk_30
#EndaKenny	2017-05-23	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	Nothing is acceptable to Deputy Adams no matter how good or adequate it might be. What is acceptable, however, is the fact that the budget has increased from €826 million to €853 million for this year. What is acceptable is that 1,100 posts have been filled since 2011. What is acceptable is that 160 additional posts have been recruited and filled between January and March of this year and that recruitment campaigns are currently under way and being followed through diligently. What is acceptable is that sanction has been given for an additional 114 assistant psychologists to enhance early intervention primary care counselling services for those under 18 years of age in particular. What is acceptable is the development of a plan to improve 7/7 mental health care nationally. That has been progressed and is nearing completion. What is acceptable is that this has been prioritised in all areas and should be in a position to provide access to a weekend service for current service users, including those in north Louth and many other areas throughout the country. What is acceptable is that a full mapping exercise has been carried out. The HSE is consulting all health sector personnel and assessing the resource implications in order to develop costed actions. I will follow up in respect of the particular issue Deputy Adams mentioned in north Louth but, overall, this was a Cinderella sector of society where there was not a voice to carry it forward. It is evident that this matter is now, and will continue to be, a central priority of the Government.The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, is doing very diligent work in this area and it is proving to be progressive. It is not yet there, by any means, in terms of it being a world-class standard but it is a very significant improvement indeed on what was left lying in isolation for so many years.	spk_32

#EndaKenny	2017-05-23	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	In any event, the Deputy's comments about primary care centres are in the context of a full programme of primary care centres being provided throughout the country. The theory is that people will be able to go to primary care centres to have medical needs which do not require treatment in accident and emergency departments dealt with and that this will help to reduce overcrowding in accident and emergency departments. When primary care centres are up and running they are required to be staffed and to have GPs available. There is little point in building them if they are going to be closed at 5 p.m.. The theory is that a person should be able to go to a primary care centre on a 24-hour basis, as is the case in so many other countries. This issue forms part of the discussions which the Minister for Health is having with the GPs in terms of their contracts and the types of facilities that they require in primary care centres. According to the HSE TrolleyGAR system this morning, there were 331 patients on trolleys in acute hospitals nationally. While this causes distress to patients, their families and to front-line services, the recent data indicates that the national situation is improving, with approximately 5% fewer patients waiting on trolleys at the end of April this year as compared with the same period last year. Notwithstanding this improvement, these figures are still too high and the Department is working assiduously with the HSE to identify measures to reduce overcrowding in our hospitals and to provide key improvement measures that will continue to reduce trolley numbers and improve patient experience. Several hospitals were under pressure this morning, including the Mater Hospital, Beaumont Hospital, St. Luke's General Hospital, Kilkenny, Letterkenny General Hospital and University Hospital Waterford. Lessons have been learned over the last number of years. The winter initiative introduced in an effort to reduce emergency department overcrowding, in respect of which an additional €40 million was provided, brought about an improvement. Lessons have been learned from that and will be implemented into the future. A range of practical measures were included in that initiative, including the provision of 90 additional beds, aids and appliances for approximately 5,000 patients, 1,000 additional home care packages and 615 additional transitional care bed approvals. In regard to the particular issue raised by Deputy Mattie McGrath, I will ask the Minister to follow up on the matter for him.	spk_44

#EndaKenny	2017-05-23	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	We are at the job a long time.I will ensure that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, comes back to the Deputy about the particular issue he raised. When facilities are provided, either by the taxpayer or through PPPs, they are provided for a particular purpose. It is up to management to make them work in the best interests of all the people by giving the best level of service. I take the Deputy's point.	spk_50
#EndaKenny	2017-05-23	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	If all the facilities are there, they should be made to work in the interests of people. I will ensure that the matter is followed up with the Minister for Health.	spk_52
#EndaKenny	2017-05-23	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	This is an important subject. The Government has prioritised disability by appointing Deputy Finian McGrath as Minister of State at the Department of Health to sit at the Cabinet table and articulate the concerns and anxieties relating to this area on a regular basis. Disability funding has increased over the past year and early intervention services and services for school-age children with disabilities need to be improved and organised more effectively. This process is well under way and the HSE is engaged in reconfiguring its therapy resources into geographically-based teams for children aged from birth to 18. The objective of the new model of assessment and intervention is to provide a single, clear referral pathway for all children, irrespective of the disability they have, where they live or the school they attend, as evidence shows that is an important element of progress. Some €8 million in additional funding was invested in 2014-2015 in order to provide 200 additional posts to support the implementation of that model. A further €4 million in additional funding was allocated in respect of 75 therapy posts in 2016 and it is expected that as this reconfiguration of services takes place it will have a significant impact on the HSE's ability to meet the needs of children and young people in a much more efficient, effective and equitable manner. In 2013, 260 front-line primary care staff positions were approved.That included 52 occupational therapists and 52 speech and language therapists. The aim is for that recruitment to continue which will lead to a reduction in waiting lists and times. A further €4 million was provided in that regard in 2014. Since the June 2007 commencement of Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005, the HSE has endeavoured to meet its legislative requirements as specifically referred to by Deputy Healy. The number of applications for assessment under the Act has increased each year since it was introduced. It is anticipated that in excess of 6,000 applications will be received this year. It can take a significant period to determine accurately the nature of a disability which a child might have. Although there has been continual investment in this area, there are significant challenges in meeting the statutory timeframes which apply to the assessment of needs process. The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy McGrath, is dealing with the delay in assessments. He is trying to resolve those delays by direct consultation. There is an ongoing recruitment campaign to combat the issue of staff shortage. The Minister of State is working with the HSE to deal with this in order that the requirements of the Act can be met by the HSE and there are no delays beyond the period for assessment and determination of a disability.	spk_54
#EndaKenny	2017-05-23	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	It is not acceptable for any State agency to be outside the legal requirements of what it has to do. The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy McGrath, who has special responsibility for disability issues, sits at the Cabinet table, has a substantial budget and is working assiduously to deal with this issue. If there are 6,000 assessments to be carried out this year, more than 100 must take place each week. Many of these assessments are quite complex and take a period of time to assess accurately.	spk_56
#EndaKenny	2017-05-23	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	As the Deputy knows, parents have every right to know the nature and scale of the disability that their child or children may have to deal with. The Act itself-----	spk_58
#EndaKenny	2017-05-23	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	There has been much collaboration between the health and education sectors on the issue of children's disability. That is facilitated by the cross-sectoral team and the implementation of the Disability Act. That team comprises representatives of the Department of Health, the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the HSE executive, the National Council for Special Education and the National Educational Psychological Service. As Deputy Healy is aware, a detailed report was compiled by Mr. Eamon Stack, chairman of the National Council for Special Education, which sets out a progressive way of dealing with the issue. While waiting lists are unacceptable and should not exist, the Minister of State is at the forefront of dealing with the delays. In the near future, it is hoped the law in terms of assessment for children will be fully complied with, unlike the current situation where children have to wait for longer than they should.	spk_61
#EndaKenny	2017-05-23	dail	32	Manchester Arena Bombing: Expressions of Sympathy	dbsect_3	This is very distressing. On behalf of the Government and, while the President is away, all of the people of Ireland I would like to extend our deepest sympathy to the people of Great Britain on the dreadful attack which took place in Manchester last night. The atrocity is made all the more appalling by its deliberate targeting of young people and families, the targeting of innocence and enjoyment, as they began to make their way home from the Manchester Arena. For those who have had the opportunity, and indeed privilege, of bringing their children to a concert like this, the excitement goes on for months beforehand. It is a huge adventure for young people and young children. We think of parents who bring their children to a concert venue and leave them outside to go in and participate in the adventure. To think that some of them last night never came back and never will come back is appalling. What was potentially a night of absolute enjoyment was transformed into a nightmare in which at least 22 people have lost their lives and so many others have been injured. These are reminders of the depravity of the views of a few. These beliefs have no place in our society. I spoke with the Tánaiste and the Garda Commissioner early this morning about the situation. I was due to speak to the Prime Minister about other matters earlier this morning but we have rescheduled that conversation for later on this evening. Our embassy had its lines open all night in London and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, and Ambassador Dan Mulhall have been available to offer any assistance that is appropriate. COBRA, the security briefing committee, met this morning with the Prime Minister chairing it. Our security levels here are monitored very carefully by the Tánaiste, the Garda Commissioner and the Garda authorities. That level remains at moderate, which means an attack is possible but not likely. The situation for people around the country is that we have a very detailed level of shared information with other countries. The reason that this level has not been increased in Ireland is that we do not have any evidence of it being beyond the moderate stage. That is not the situation in Great Britain, where evidence of planned attacks exists. The Prime Minister speaks for the British Government in that respect. Last night's attack is a reminder that no one is immune from those whose hatred of our values drives such evil acts. I assure the public that all the necessary measures are being taken by our authorities here to counteract such deadly threats. The Garda authorities will continue to work very closely with our UK and EU counterparts and other countries in responding to the threat of international terrorism and violence inspired by extremists. There can never be any justification for the brutal inhumanity displayed in Manchester last night. The number of children caught up in these events makes it particularly hard to bear for all of those involved. Our thoughts and prayers are obviously with the victims and their families and all of those who are affected by this atrocity. People in our country are heartbroken by this. The city of Manchester has such exceptionally close ties with this country for so many reasons over so many years. We support them absolutely. Listening this morning to the Mayor of Manchester, and the Mayor of Liverpool whose children were at this concert last night, gives us a sense of how a predetermined atrocity can impact in so many ways and cause such devastation for families.I will speak to Prime Minister May later this evening in respect of any details of which we should be aware and any assistance our Government, people and agencies can offer the British people at this time.	spk_63

While it is a matter of rights, it is also a matter of procedures and follow through. We could have ratified the convention without being able to fulfil what it means. In this country, we have always taken the view that we deal with the legislation, put it through and implement it and then ratify conventions so that we can stand over them and say we ratified a convention because the necessary legislation was in place. I have answered questions in the House about this issue for a number of years. A suite of legislation had to be passed. Believe me, the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, has raised this matter at Cabinet on a number of occasions and we are coming close to reaching a conclusion. That is the story. I will have the Minister of State respond to the House on this matter. It is not a case of dragging heels but getting the legislation through properly - the last piece of it is quite sensitive - and then ratifying the UN convention in order that we can stand over it.	spk_78
#EndaKenny	2017-05-23	dail	32	Order of Business	dbsect_4	Deputy Burton is well aware from her time as a Minister of what happens here. These are recommendations from the European Commission. Obviously, the Government takes these things into account but as we speak, the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform are meeting in Brussels with the European Investment Bank about the very issue of infrastructure in order that a proposition can be put forward by which funding and a stream of income resulting from major pieces of infrastructure can be put forward. Elements of that would be, for instance, the metro for Dublin or, for instance, the major motorway required from Cork to Limerick, in respect of which a stream of income would come to fund loans for those propositions and more to follow. Deputy Burton is well aware that there is a €42 billion programme for infrastructural investment here. The review of the capital programme out to 2021 is currently under way. The AIB situation has been referred to by the Minister for Finance on many occasions, a Cheann Comhairle. That is a paper exercise. When the testing of the 25% share sale is gone through, that will be used for debt reduction. The Commission is entitled to make its views known, as it has. It has made its views known on Apple and it has made its views known on other things, but the Government would be very careful to manage prudently our economic affairs in the interests of our people-----	spk_80

One of the issues that has arisen in respect of the Garda, for instance, is for it to have access to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Labour Court. The legislation that is being drafted for that will take into account some serious matters that need to be considered, one of which is what the Deputy refers to, but that is an element of what Government is doing here and willing to do in respect of giving the members of the Garda full representation and hearing at the WRC and the Labour Court.

#EndaKenny	2017-05-23	dail	32	Order of Business	dbsect_4	Deputy Ó Broin raises an important point. Obviously, others have had reductions, but we do not hear about those too often. The heads of this Bill were cleared in April by Government. There has been quite a deal of discussion between the Attorney General's office and the Department. I expect that when the Bill comes before the House and is cleared for discussion, that the intent will be to have a comprehensive response to a situation that I know causes difficulties where increases in rates occur.	spk_106
#EndaKenny	2017-05-23	dail	32	Order of Business	dbsect_4	It is not a matter of legislation. There has been a substantial increase in the number of planning permissions applied for and granted, and these apply in all cases. Clearly, local authorities and the transport authority have an issue in respect of more exits on national routes. We have had occasions in the past where roads have lost their national secondary or primary status because of the incidence of new exits - traditionally through section 4 notices - given that there is a matter of road safety involved where that happens. That is a matter for discussion between local authorities and the transport authority. In respect of the planning guidelines, obviously, any couple or individual applying for planning permission in the Deputy's county or anywhere else goes through a preplanning discussion with their local authority. It is not national guidelines that are imposed in the vast majority of cases. This can be seen in the rate of increase in the number of planning applications applied for and approvals granted, which is substantial.	spk_108

#EndaKenny	2017-05-23	dail	32	Order of Business	dbsect_4	The Deputy raises two issues. One is in respect of the Bill, which is on Committee Stage in the Seanad. While it has not yet come to the Dáil, it will do so in due course. Obviously, Members will have an opportunity to voice their opinions on it. The second point the Deputy raises relates to the statistics that are produced. In the context of statistics involving the Garda Síochána, there is an analysis going on in respect of another element of the statistics, which I expect will be quite detailed, and that can be followed through with regard to these statistics also. Unfortunately, domestic violence is an issue in Ireland. It causes havoc for families and family relationships, with a particularly dramatic and traumatic impact on children.	spk_117

They were obviously unable to contain what happened afterwards and this resulted in massive destruction to property, assets and value, and also in terms of the impact on wildlife and nature in so many ways. For those who have been victimised by these acts of arson, if that is what they were, we cannot expect them to have the State suddenly say, ""You are responsible for this yourself"". If the land is blackened and the trees burned and if people's assets are decimated, I think it is an issue that needs to be looked at with some degree of compassion and consideration.

On 22 February, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs received formal notification from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel that a draftsperson was assigned specifically to work on the affordable childcare scheme Bill. The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs started work together on the drafting of the Bill in March and this work is ongoing. No date is yet confirmed for when the drafting of the Bill will be complete. Nonetheless, the Government is conscious of the position and wants to make arrangements so that payments under the scheme will become effective in September. This is quite a complicated Bill and the timeline is tight, but it is hoped it can be met.	spk_124

The Cabinet committee on infrastructure, environment and climate action has met on five occasions since it was reconstituted in June 2016. The last meeting of the Cabinet committee took place on 15 May 2017. The next meeting of the Cabinet committee will be scheduled shortly.  My Department provides the secretariat to the Cabinet committee on infrastructure, environment and climate action and chairs the associated senior officials' group. The Cabinet committee oversees the development and delivery of key infrastructure and associated policy, including oversight of relevant commitments in A Programme for a Partnership Government. In addition, the committee addresses the climate change challenge in terms of domestic policy and in relation to Ireland's EU and international obligations.	spk_133
#EndaKenny	2017-05-23	dail	32	National Economic and Social Council	dbsect_6	As the Deputy rightly points out, under the mid-term review, the Government will confirm the allocation of the additional €5.14 billion committed for capital investment. Following commitments made in the budget for 2017 and the increase in funding for housing, there is approximately €2.65 billion in uncommitted additional capital through to 2021. Submissions from the Departments are being received by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Public consultation was undertaken in April to inform the view of the capital plan. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will assess the submissions received from Departments and make recommendations to Government in the third quarter of 2017 to inform the Government's final decision on revised capital allocations to be announced in the context of the budget for 2018, which will obviously take place in October. The review of the plan will take place in two stages. Phase 1 will be a focused review of priorities, aimed primarily at advising Government in the context of budget 2018 on how the additional capital funding committed by Government should be allocated over the remainder of the plan.Phase 2 will assess and report on the framework required to underpin longer-term analysis of Ireland's infrastructural planning needs. In my address to the Institute of International and European Affairs, Ireland at the Heart of a Changing European Union, I reaffirmed that the national planning framework for spatial planning due to be finalised later this year will be complemented with a longer-term ten-year capital plan.	spk_140

#EndaKenny	2017-05-23	dail	32	National Economic and Social Council	dbsect_6	In respect of the capital expenditure programme, the six-year capital plan published in 2015 set out an Exchequer capital spend of €27 billion. Including the wider semi-State sector and public private partnerships, the total State-backed capital investment is €42 billion. That will support more than 45,000 construction-related jobs. A Programme for a Partnership Government committed to additional capital investment to be allocated in areas such as transport, housing, broadband, health, education, flood defences etc. on the basis of the outcome of the mid-term review of the capital plan. In the summer economic statement of 2016, the Government committed to an additional €5.14 billion in Exchequer capital funding over the period 2017 to 2021. Clearly, the programme for capital investment is very extensive at €42 billion, including all of the different elements of the sector.	spk_146

It is always difficult to get PPPs that work effectively and that can be streamlined to a point where they deliver well. The bundles of secondary schools, of which the Deputy had some experience himself in his time as Minister, have evolved to a very presentable, effective way of delivering high-class building in a short time. As far as I am aware, they have all been under budget and on time. Some of the schools I have been in are enormous and provide every conceivable facility for people to do their job. The role of the committee is to drive the development and the delivery of key infrastructure and associated policy, including the role of NewERA in support of sustainable economic development, job creation and better quality of life. It plays a role in overseeing Ireland's transition to a low-carbon economy, including co-ordination of international negotiations, obligations on energy and climate change and provides oversight of relevant commitments in A Programme for a Partnership Government. As I indicated previously, there is a €42 billion programme involving 45,000 construction jobs.

A number of important issues were raised regarding the adequacy of the current policy responses and the clarity of national sector plans in meeting Ireland's national and European targets. The Departments are working with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to review the submissions with a view to strengthening the draft plan ahead of its presentation to Government next month. The Minister, Deputy Naughten, is establishing the advisory group - and Deputies are aware of this - to guide the activities of the national dialogue during its initial two-year phase. That membership will be drawn from public, private and NGO bodies. The first meeting of the advisory group is to take place in June this year. The group will be supported by a secretariat within the Environmental Protection Agency, which will also manage the administration of the dialogue. Regional gatherings will take place, to begin in the autumn of 2017, and it is also proposed that the dialogue will include the national climate change action and awareness programme in schools and communities. This includes the Green-Schools scheme, expert lectures, and climate expos and events around the climate implications of spatial choices.

#EndaKenny	2017-05-23	dail	32	National Economic and Social Council	dbsect_6	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 9, inclusive, together. The Cabinet committee on Brexit met three times in 2017, namely, on 26 January, 8 March and 26 April. It has met a total of eight times since its first meeting in September 2016. In addition, Michel Barnier, the EU negotiator, attended a meeting with a number of members of the committee on 11 May. On 2 May, the Government published a comprehensive document on Ireland and the negotiations on the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This document sets out the approach of the Government to the forthcoming negotiations, following the successful campaign to have key Irish issues recognised in the EU negotiating position. Following on from this publication, work is under way to prepare a further paper on economic implications of the Brexit challenge. This will draw on the work to date across Departments, which will be developed to mitigate emerging sectoral challenges. The paper will build on ongoing cross-Government research, analysis and consultations and will reflect the core economic themes of the speech I gave to the Institute of International and European Affairs on 15 February. It will include issues such as sustainable fiscal policies to ensure capacity to absorb and respond to economic shocks, not simply from Brexit. There will be plans for policies to make Irish enterprise more diverse and resilient, to diversify trade and investment patterns and to strengthen competitiveness. It will prioritise policy measures and dedicate resources to protect jobs and businesses in the sectors and regions most affected by Brexit. It will realise economic opportunities arising from Brexit and will help businesses adjust to any new logistical or trade barriers arising. The paper will make a strong case at EU level that Ireland will require support that recognises where Brexit represents a serious disturbance to the Irish economy.	spk_183
#EndaKenny	2017-05-23	dail	32	National Economic and Social Council	dbsect_6	Deputies Burton, Nolan and Martin have raised a number of issues. The priorities, as outlined by Mr. Barnier during his visit to Ireland, follow what we had set out ourselves. I am glad that people recognised that. I thank all concerned for acknowledging that these issues formed part of the European Parliament's documents and the European Council decision. As pointed out by Deputy Martin, these have been approved by the General Affairs Council and will form the basis for the negotiations. The first three issues are the principles and modalities for whatever the liabilities are in respect of the UK, the Border issue, and the question of citizens' rights and reciprocal rights. No one underestimates the scale of what might happen. The impact of Brexit on the Irish economy will be significant, particularly if it is not handled in a proper, orderly and responsible way. We share the view, as does everybody else, regarding the need to maintain the closest possible trading relationship between the UK and the EU, but it will be difficult to retain it the same as it is now because if the UK sheds the Single Market, the status in respect of trade will be changed. Let us be clear about it, Ireland's economic interests lie in a strong and well-functioning European Union with continued and unfettered access to the Single Market. It is where our people have continually said they want to be, as voted for in a referendum in the past. This issue is of immense importance to all our small and medium enterprises and companies that export. There will be a great deal of trading on this issue. Nobody is clear on where the road ahead will lead. If there was to be an end to the divorce proceedings in two years and no deal, what would be the outcome of that? The British Government might say that no deal is better than a bad deal, but no deal would be catastrophic in many respects for Ireland. I hope that the conclusions to the negotiations in respect of the first three priorities will bear fruit in order that we can get on to these details. We are developing an economic paper, to which Deputy Martin referred. A number of issues have already been brought to light. We are working to improve the business environment and are examining new trade and investment strategies, with an intensified programme of trade missions. Enterprise Ireland is working with firms to help support product and service innovation; additional staff have been recruited; a €150 million loan was provided in budget 2017 for low-cost loans to farmers; and the national planning framework 2040 will be delivered this year, complemented by a ten-year national capital plan. I agree that we need to be Brexit ready. This means we must build the roadway to the north west to Derry. While there are some legal complications in that regard, we need to get on with our end of it.	spk_187
#EndaKenny	2017-05-23	dail	32	National Economic and Social Council	dbsect_6	It will be important that we make a case to Europe for assistance in that regard. The reason, in part, the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform are in Brussels today is to discuss a range of possibilities under the European Investment Fund. If we can get the Northern Ireland Executive functioning, the North-South Ministerial Council and cross-Border agencies and organisations can begin to work in that regard. All the scenarios are being examined. On the issue raised by Deputy Nolan, we have said that we do not want a return to the type of Border that existed in the past. Taking the scenario that there will be no tariffs on any goods travelling between the Republic and Northern Ireland or between the Republic and Great Britain or  In terms of what we, as a people, have acquired and what the British, as a people, have acquired since 1922 in the common travel area, we are confident we can retain all of that in a bilateral sense between ourselves and Great Britain. As Deputy Martin has often pointed out, when people voted for the Good Friday Agreement, they voted on the expectation of continuing to have European citizenship. All the people in Northern Ireland entitled to Irish citizenship are also entitled to European citizenship. A great deal of activity will take place on these issues. When I discussed this with European leaders, it was agreed that whatever we would do would be in compliance with European legislation and the European legal system because that is where we are staying. While there may be differences in comment from some members of the British Government, we have called for a recognition of our priorities and the particular and unique circumstances that apply in Ireland, but the outcome will have to be in compliance with European legislation and we will see that that happens.	spk_189
#EndaKenny	2017-05-23	dail	32	National Economic and Social Council	dbsect_6	I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 14, inclusive, together. I have appointed a new National Economic and Social Council, NESC. The new council will meet on 24 May and I expect that it will discuss its work programme and working methods at that meeting. It is a matter for the council to agree its own working arrangements. The council's remit is to analyse and report on strategic issues for Ireland’s economic, social, environmental and sustainable development. I am keen that the council considers longer-term issues such as housing, broadband, climate change, pensions and long-term funding models in education and health. The NESC, with its track record of engagement and consistent and high quality work on contentious issues, has an important role to play. As the Deputies will be aware, the NESC secretariat continues its work on issues relevant to the programme for Government, including jobless households, social dimensions of the crisis, consumer prices, labour market activation and the funding of higher education. The new council has a reduced membership of three members each from the nominating sectors, seven independents and six public servants. This is in line with the views of the outgoing members around the need for smaller, more focused plenary sessions and a strong representation from the Government side. I will circulate membership of the council for the benefit of Members which includes people from the business and employer sector, the ICTU, the farming and agriculture sector, the community and voluntary sector, the environmental sector, public servants and independent experts.	spk_190
#EndaKenny	2017-05-23	dail	32	National Economic and Social Council	dbsect_6	I had better make a comment but I will keep it short. Deputy Burton mentioned shadow borders. I understand the Commissioner, at the meeting last week, was talking about hypothetical situations. There was agreement at the meeting that the political outcomes would be impossible to quantify until the negotiations got started.The political imperative is that there should be no return to what was there. In that context, and as I discussed with Deputy Nolan on the earlier group of questions, we need to examine issues such as dealing with two different jurisdictions even if there are no tariffs. As already stated, the Commissioner was referring to hypothetical situations. I agree with Deputy Eamon Ryan that the NESC should be more flexible and adaptable. The approach should suggest that. That is the message we will give to the group, although it is within its remit to determine its own working arrangements. In view of the current situation, I agree that it should be more flexible and adaptable. Deputy Nolan's question is somewhat premature, particularly in view of the fact that the meeting will take place tomorrow. All of the groups are represented with the exception of farming and agriculture. Nominees to represent the latter are yet to be confirmed. It is up to those groups to make the nominations. As the Deputy will appreciate, there are some very good people involved in this process. They are going to consider the question of housing, broadband, climate change, long-term funding models in education and health, pensions and any other issues that need to be dealt with. The council will look at the issues of jobless households, the social dimensions of the crisis, consumer prices, labour market activation and the funding of higher education. Deputy Micheál Martin made some interesting observations. Nobody foresaw Brexit six years ago. It was not even on the horizon. Until 11 o'clock on the night before the referendum, those in favour of a leave vote believed it was never going to happen. That it did was an indictment of the failure to have proper political involvement in the context of explaining to people what Brexit was about. There were so many different-----	spk_198
#EndaKenny	2017-05-23	dail	32	National Economic and Social Council	dbsect_6	I am aware of that. The Deputy said that nobody foresaw the economic crisis. One could not have foreseen Brexit.

This will draw on the work to date across Departments, which will be developed to mitigate emerging sectoral challenges. The paper will build on ongoing cross-Government research, analysis and consultations and will reflect the core economic themes of the speech I gave to the Institute of International and European Affairs on 15 February. It will include issues such as sustainable fiscal policies to ensure capacity to absorb and respond to economic shocks, not simply from Brexit. There will be plans for policies to make Irish enterprise more diverse and resilient, to diversify trade and investment patterns and to strengthen competitiveness. It will prioritise policy measures and dedicate resources to protect jobs and businesses in the sectors and regions most affected by Brexit. It will realise economic opportunities arising from Brexit and will help businesses adjust to any new logistical or trade barriers arising. The paper will make a strong case at EU level that Ireland will require support that recognises where Brexit represents a serious disturbance to the Irish economy.	spk_183
#EndaKenny	2017-05-23	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_8	Deputies Burton, Nolan and Martin have raised a number of issues. The priorities, as outlined by Mr. Barnier during his visit to Ireland, follow what we had set out ourselves. I am glad that people recognised that. I thank all concerned for acknowledging that these issues formed part of the European Parliament's documents and the European Council decision. As pointed out by Deputy Martin, these have been approved by the General Affairs Council and will form the basis for the negotiations. The first three issues are the principles and modalities for whatever the liabilities are in respect of the UK, the Border issue, and the question of citizens' rights and reciprocal rights. No one underestimates the scale of what might happen. The impact of Brexit on the Irish economy will be significant, particularly if it is not handled in a proper, orderly and responsible way. We share the view, as does everybody else, regarding the need to maintain the closest possible trading relationship between the UK and the EU, but it will be difficult to retain it the same as it is now because if the UK sheds the Single Market, the status in respect of trade will be changed. Let us be clear about it, Ireland's economic interests lie in a strong and well-functioning European Union with continued and unfettered access to the Single Market. It is where our people have continually said they want to be, as voted for in a referendum in the past. This issue is of immense importance to all our small and medium enterprises and companies that export. There will be a great deal of trading on this issue. Nobody is clear on where the road ahead will lead. If there was to be an end to the divorce proceedings in two years and no deal, what would be the outcome of that? The British Government might say that no deal is better than a bad deal, but no deal would be catastrophic in many respects for Ireland. I hope that the conclusions to the negotiations in respect of the first three priorities will bear fruit in order that we can get on to these details. We are developing an economic paper, to which Deputy Martin referred. A number of issues have already been brought to light. We are working to improve the business environment and are examining new trade and investment strategies, with an intensified programme of trade missions. Enterprise Ireland is working with firms to help support product and service innovation; additional staff have been recruited; a €150 million loan was provided in budget 2017 for low-cost loans to farmers; and the national planning framework 2040 will be delivered this year, complemented by a ten-year national capital plan. I agree that we need to be Brexit ready. This means we must build the roadway to the north west to Derry. While there are some legal complications in that regard, we need to get on with our end of it.	spk_187
#EndaKenny	2017-05-23	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_8	It will be important that we make a case to Europe for assistance in that regard. The reason, in part, the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform are in Brussels today is to discuss a range of possibilities under the European Investment Fund. If we can get the Northern Ireland Executive functioning, the North-South Ministerial Council and cross-Border agencies and organisations can begin to work in that regard. All the scenarios are being examined. On the issue raised by Deputy Nolan, we have said that we do not want a return to the type of Border that existed in the past. Taking the scenario that there will be no tariffs on any goods travelling between the Republic and Northern Ireland or between the Republic and Great Britain or  In terms of what we, as a people, have acquired and what the British, as a people, have acquired since 1922 in the common travel area, we are confident we can retain all of that in a bilateral sense between ourselves and Great Britain. As Deputy Martin has often pointed out, when people voted for the Good Friday Agreement, they voted on the expectation of continuing to have European citizenship. All the people in Northern Ireland entitled to Irish citizenship are also entitled to European citizenship. A great deal of activity will take place on these issues. When I discussed this with European leaders, it was agreed that whatever we would do would be in compliance with European legislation and the European legal system because that is where we are staying. While there may be differences in comment from some members of the British Government, we have called for a recognition of our priorities and the particular and unique circumstances that apply in Ireland, but the outcome will have to be in compliance with European legislation and we will see that that happens.	spk_189
#EndaKenny	2017-05-23	dail	32	National Economic and Social Council	dbsect_9	I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 14, inclusive, together. I have appointed a new National Economic and Social Council, NESC. The new council will meet on 24 May and I expect that it will discuss its work programme and working methods at that meeting. It is a matter for the council to agree its own working arrangements. The council's remit is to analyse and report on strategic issues for Ireland’s economic, social, environmental and sustainable development. I am keen that the council considers longer-term issues such as housing, broadband, climate change, pensions and long-term funding models in education and health. The NESC, with its track record of engagement and consistent and high quality work on contentious issues, has an important role to play. As the Deputies will be aware, the NESC secretariat continues its work on issues relevant to the programme for Government, including jobless households, social dimensions of the crisis, consumer prices, labour market activation and the funding of higher education. The new council has a reduced membership of three members each from the nominating sectors, seven independents and six public servants. This is in line with the views of the outgoing members around the need for smaller, more focused plenary sessions and a strong representation from the Government side. I will circulate membership of the council for the benefit of Members which includes people from the business and employer sector, the ICTU, the farming and agriculture sector, the community and voluntary sector, the environmental sector, public servants and independent experts.	spk_190
#EndaKenny	2017-05-23	dail	32	National Economic and Social Council	dbsect_9	I had better make a comment but I will keep it short. Deputy Burton mentioned shadow borders. I understand the Commissioner, at the meeting last week, was talking about hypothetical situations. There was agreement at the meeting that the political outcomes would be impossible to quantify until the negotiations got started.The political imperative is that there should be no return to what was there. In that context, and as I discussed with Deputy Nolan on the earlier group of questions, we need to examine issues such as dealing with two different jurisdictions even if there are no tariffs. As already stated, the Commissioner was referring to hypothetical situations. I agree with Deputy Eamon Ryan that the NESC should be more flexible and adaptable. The approach should suggest that. That is the message we will give to the group, although it is within its remit to determine its own working arrangements. In view of the current situation, I agree that it should be more flexible and adaptable. Deputy Nolan's question is somewhat premature, particularly in view of the fact that the meeting will take place tomorrow. All of the groups are represented with the exception of farming and agriculture. Nominees to represent the latter are yet to be confirmed. It is up to those groups to make the nominations. As the Deputy will appreciate, there are some very good people involved in this process. They are going to consider the question of housing, broadband, climate change, long-term funding models in education and health, pensions and any other issues that need to be dealt with. The council will look at the issues of jobless households, the social dimensions of the crisis, consumer prices, labour market activation and the funding of higher education. Deputy Micheál Martin made some interesting observations. Nobody foresaw Brexit six years ago. It was not even on the horizon. Until 11 o'clock on the night before the referendum, those in favour of a leave vote believed it was never going to happen. That it did was an indictment of the failure to have proper political involvement in the context of explaining to people what Brexit was about. There were so many different-----	spk_198
#EndaKenny	2017-05-23	dail	32	National Economic and Social Council	dbsect_9	I am aware of that. The Deputy said that nobody foresaw the economic crisis. One could not have foreseen Brexit. When Fine Gael was in opposition during the years 2002 to 2007, Deputy Bruton repeatedly spoke about the housing bubble and stated that it was going to burst. What was he told? That things would get boomier and boomier.	spk_200
#EndaKenny	2017-05-23	dail	32	National Economic and Social Council	dbsect_9	A person sat in this chair and said that we did not need any more tax receipts from housing. Deputy Michéal Martin knows that the whole thing stagnated for nine months as a result of that. We now have to deal with the repercussions.	spk_202
#EndaKenny	2017-05-23	dail	32	National Economic and Social Council	dbsect_9	I understand that. There is a massive effort to provide supply of houses. I hope that, at its meeting tomorrow, the NESC shows an adaptive approach and deals with these issues.	spk_204
#EndaKenny	2017-05-17	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I agree with Deputy Martin that the system we have had here for many years is not up to speed in the context of major new drugs that are approved by the FDA and similar authorities. Furthermore, being a small country, we do not have the financial reach to be able to provide for all new drugs that come on stream very quickly. The case made by the Deputy about melanoma is one of many such cases. I received a letter from a major pharmaceutical company recently about a number of drugs that are produced by the company that are not used in Ireland but which are exported around the world. The recent situation in respect of Orkambi is instructive here. Orkambi is exceptionally expensive, for very good reasons. In that context, we had international collaboration looking at the whole question of the priorities attached to drugs, how they should be funded and the relevant costs that should apply. Rather than proceeding alone, as one country, this is the way to go in the future. In collaboration with a number of other countries, significant reductions were brought about in the cost of that particular drug, together with an analysis of the improvement in the quality of life that the drug would actually provide for cystic fibrosis sufferers.  The process in respect of melanoma is under way in the HSE and the relevant agencies. The point Deputy Martin makes is that we are not in a position to provide ultra-modern drugs that come on the scene which clearly bring about serious improvements in the lives of patients suffering from various ailments. I was struck by the fact that no sooner was the decision made, money provided and an agreement reached for Orkambi, another 35 to 40 new drugs were being named as coming on stream for different ailments, many of which were also very expensive. We need to look nationally at the scale of what we provide for drug purchase in respect of a range of ailments, and internationally at whether we can collaborate with other countries on the purchase of modern drugs for specialised ailments, including various forms of cancer. Perhaps that is the way to go. I am quite sure there is a measure of agreement across the House on these matters. As the Deputy is aware, we do not have an endless pit of money. I think we can improve the way we deal with the provision of drugs, thereby leaving aside the priority attached to the drugs for which we can actually provide money.	spk_2
#EndaKenny	2017-05-17	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	The advances made over the years in medicine generally and in particular ailments have been astounding. The pipeline of new drugs coming on stream has simply exploded because of the research, the innovation and the work that is going into precise and specific elements for which drugs are now produced. The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 sets out the legal and statutory process in this regard. The HSE makes the decisions here. We are awaiting a decision in the case of the melanoma drugs mentioned by the Deputy. As he has pointed out, responsibility for such decisions has been transferred from those involved in the political process to those involved in the quality-of-life process who have the clinical excellence and so on. There has been an explosion in the number of new drugs coming through the pipeline. Now that the Orkambi case has been settled, we are awaiting the provision of finance to provide between 30 and 40 new drugs to patients with particular ailments. The Minister for Health travelled to Malta earlier this month to sign the Valletta declaration, under which Ireland and seven other countries have agreed to work together on procuring, deciding on priorities and bringing about cost reductions so that more patients will be able to access new and specific drugs. I am sure that any Minister for Health would like to be able to say that as new drugs for particular chronic ailments, including melanomas, come on stream and are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, he or she will be in a position to provide for those drugs. Even though cost reductions have been secured in the case of Orkambi for a very good cause - cystic fibrosis patients - I understand it is the most expensive drug in this country's history. The Minister and the Department are aware of this issue. I think that by bringing about international collaboration between the countries that have signed up to the Valletta declaration on joint procurement, we will bring about an improvement in this situation.	spk_4
#EndaKenny	2017-05-17	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	The assessment for the two melanoma drugs mentioned by the Deputy is under way with the HSE.The Minister can give the Deputy more precise details of the work involved in or the point of that assessment.	spk_6
#EndaKenny	2017-05-17	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	Because of the importance of family and care services for children, the Government set up a ministry with responsibility for children, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, held a referendum on children's rights and established the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, which is funded very substantially by the taxpayer every year. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has pointed out that there is quite a number of vulnerable children in different locations around the country who are not being left unattended and that the recruitment of the social workers required to provide individual attention is still under way. The Deputy mentioned the issue of domestic violence. Clearly, it impacts on families such as the ones he mentioned. I do not have the details of the cases he outlined but obviously they were very serious for the two people to whom he referred. Perhaps he might talk directly to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs who would advise him of the situation so far as Tusla is concerned. Obviously, it is a new agency. There are more and more pieces of information coming to light on challenges for various families and children throughout the country and social workers are under pressure to deal with all the cases with which they have to deal. Arising from the incidence of domestic violence cases, quite a number of initiatives have been taken to enable such incidents to be dealt with and, where possible, prevented but where they do happen the children involved should be catered for properly. On the two individual cases mentioned by the Deputy, of which I do not have the details, I suggest he talk directly to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.	spk_8
#EndaKenny	2017-05-17	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	That was the reason for setting up Tusla in the first place and having a senior Minister responsible for children and a Department of Children and Youth Affairs. The Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs met representatives of HIQA this morning to discuss inspections of foster care and foster care cases. There was €37 million allocated for Tusla for 2017 and 400 new staff are being recruited.	spk_10
#EndaKenny	2017-05-17	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I assume many of those recruited will be social workers allocated to cases involving people who are vulnerable or challenged. It is not perfect by any means and there are serious improvements to be made. I will have the Minister follow up the three particular cases mentioned by the Deputy.	spk_12
#EndaKenny	2017-05-17	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	It is important to say to Deputy Howlin, who made several public pay agreements, that what is at stake here is an extension of the Lansdowne Road agreement because there were particular benefits gained on both sides in that agreement, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will engage on an extension of that with his officials and the trade unions starting next Monday. The resolution of the dispute last year in respect of the Garda included a commitment to the introduction of legislative change to give the Garda associations the right of access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court. A commitment was given that the legislation would be put in place before the end of this year and that commitment stands and will be followed through.  On 20 December last the Government approved the preparation of the heads of a Bill to provide the associations with access to the WRC and to the Labour Court. In addition to the technical legislative change required to provide access, the Government decision noted that some very significant issues will fall to be considered, including the status of the Garda associations established under An Garda Síochána Acts and the related question of the constraints upon members of taking industrial action. Do we want a situation where members of the Garda Síochána go on strike? Providing access to the WRC and the Labour Court does not of itself imply the removal of either the prohibition on members of the Garda Síochána joining trade unions or the constraints on industrial action. To assist in the consideration of these and some ancillary issues a working group chaired by Mr. John Murphy, the recently retired Secretary General of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, has been established. The working group is considering some of the technical and practical issues that will arise and it is drawing on the experience and expertise of the relevant Departments and bodies of the group. The working group has identified several key issues that will require consideration. These include whether the associations should become full trade unions, the question of constraints on industrial action, the range of matters on which access is to be provided to the WRC and the Labour Court, what internal processes are to be put in place and be exhausted prior to issues being brought to the WRC - and that is part now of the structural work the commission announced yesterday and which it will also consider in terms of the workings of An Garda Síochána - how industrial relations should operate within the Garda Síochána and when access to the WRC and the Labour Court has been provided. The Garda associations have met with the working group so that their views are heard at an early stage in the process. The implementation of the Labour Court recommendations is ongoing and substantial progress is being made in addressing those. Day to day management of the Defence Forces is the responsibility under statutory instrument of the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Kehoe. He is considering a range of issues in respect of the Defence Forces, their personnel, their families and facilities.	spk_14

#EndaKenny	2017-05-17	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	No because the working group has its terms of reference.The report will be brought to the House for discussion and the Deputy will have plenty of opportunities to make his case at that point. The Government will have to consider it, as is the case with any other report. In respect of the Defence Forces, as the Deputy knows they are the backup to the civil power. As I said, there are substantial issues that must be addressed in respect of the legislation being prepared arising from a decision to give the Garda access to the WRC and Labour Court. The Minister of State at the Department of Defence is engaging with the Defence Forces representative. Given the constraints upon us, I want us to continue to provide the Defence Forces and their personnel with the very best facilities in order that they can do their job. I am always open to discussion, but I am not giving any commitment. It is important that we recognise the value of the contribution given by our Defence Forces, which have never let the State down.	spk_20
#EndaKenny	2017-05-17	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	The cost of increasing pensions for those currently not eligible prior to 1994 would be about €300 million. If that money was allocated, one would probably not have any money to increase pensions as a consequence. The Minister for Social Production has examined the way in which contributory pensions are calculated. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social Protection will be in receipt of a suite of options which will be presented for its consideration in the next couple of months. Deputy Collins read out two articles from the Constitution as it was written. There have been increased opportunities for women in the home who want to participate in the labour force due to increased employment levels and many other methods. The point the Deputy has raised is an issue. There is a cost attached to it and I suggest that he wait until all of the options presented to the Joint Committee on Social Production in the coming months for discussion by Deputies have been considered.	spk_22
#EndaKenny	2017-05-17	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	It is all about choices because one does not have the resources to do everything that might be desirable. While this is a desirable option, it would cost €300 million to go back to 1970. If that is done, there will be no capacity to increase pensions, lone-parent allowances or other measures. There is no endless pit of money, which is why all of the actuarial assessments and different options are being prepared for consideration and will be brought before the committee in a couple of months. It is a choice. If we do what the Deputy suggests, while desirable, it will implicitly suggest we will not have any money to increase pensions or a range of other allowances that would be catered to in the normal course. As such, it is important to lay out the facts before priorities are assessed and decisions made.	spk_24

The Deputy is engaged in a campaign throughout the country with flags for Palestine all over the place, and he is entitled to do so if he wishes, but the point is we have had a very clear view in this country for very many years that we would support a two-state solution in respect of Palestine and Israel.

There is little point in having people under the assumption that they will get a service through a home care package if there are no resources there to meet it.

The Government has provided substantial moneys for new vehicles, motorbikes, CCTV and opportunities to improve the security for rural Ireland, by which I mean small-town Ireland as well as ""rural rural Ireland"". Clearly, the advantages of the text alert and communities being vigilant about these things are important. The Government seriously funded Operation Thor, which took out of operation many of the gangs that were specialist operators at breaking into houses, travelling quite a distance to do so. I am quite sure that gardaí in the Roscommon area are aware of reported break-ins or burglaries and are on to the perpetrators of these crimes. I hope the perpetrators are brought before the courts in a short time. It is a case of gardaí working with communities and availing of the facilities that are there. I find throughout vast parts of the country that the text alert through community leadership is very strong.

#EndaKenny	2017-05-17	dail	32	Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_3	I do not control the draw that takes place for Private Members' Bills. One of the changes brought about in this particular Dáil was the right of backbench or Opposition Deputies to produce Private Members' Bills. The Ceann Comhairle wrote to me last week to have a meeting next week about this matter with the chairs of the committees, because there are 140 Bills backed up currently. On the number that have been taken by Government, whereas the intent of the Private Members' Bill might be very good, it does not make it into a Bill that is fit for purpose. The central idea might be correct, but Government and Departments have had to do extensive work in working with and amending those Private Members' Bills to make them suitable to go through the pre-legislative scrutiny and eventually to be passed here. I do not know why a second Bill is down for discussion. I assume the right was there to withdraw this, if I am correct. The Ceann Comhairle might deal with that.	spk_92

It maintains oversight of the most significant areas of the health service. In the case of the winter initiative, it provided €40 million in additional funding for preparation for issues that would arise. A significant focus was placed on reducing the numbers of delayed discharges in acute hospitals through the funding and provision of additional home care packages, additional home help hours and additional transitional care beds. The number of delayed discharges was reduced from 638 in September 2016 to a low of 434 at the end of December 2016. It was maintained below 500 from mid-December through to the end of February. Obviously, there were staffing challenges. A significant issue last winter was the day-to-day maintenance of staffing levels and the ability to flex staffing levels to meet open surge capacity, in other words, at times when there was a spike in the numbers of patients coming through emergency departments. The figures released by the National Treatment Purchase Fund on Friday, 7 April confirmed that there were 84,838 patients on inpatient or day case procedure waiting lists; 18,000 waiting for a routine GI endoscopy procedure; and 466,000 waiting for a first outpatient appointment.

#EndaKenny	2017-05-17	dail	32	Programme for Government Implementation	dbsect_5	The Deputy makes a valid point about trolley numbers and the Minister for Health has made this a particular priority. Emergency department overcrowding and long patient waiting lists are of critical concern here. Last September the HSE's winter initiative was announced which provided €40 million of additional funding to deal with these matters. A range of practical measures to address emergency department overcrowding were implemented, including 90 newly-opened additional hospital beds and a reduction in delayed discharges nationally from 668 in September to 434 in December. Delayed discharges were maintained below 500 to the end of February. Aids and appliances were given to over 4,450 patients, 1,000 additional home care packages were provided and 615 additional transitional care bed approvals were also made. All these measures enabled patients to be discharged from hospital sooner. A key element of the winter initiative was for the HSE to work with hospitals to develop improvement actions and winter plans at each location. Learning from the most recent winter initiative will be important for the future. As part of the ongoing measures to relieve pressure in emergency departments, several major capital projects are under way or in the process of completion which will increase overall capacity in the hospital system. These include a new ward block and an adult mental health unit at University Hospital Galway, a new emergency department in Limerick and an extension at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda. The Department has also commenced a bed capacity review in line with the commitment in the programme for Government. That review will feed into the mid-term review of the capital programme which is under way at present. The Minister and the Department will continue to work intensively with the HSE to address the challenges and monitor the performance in the emergency departments. In Deputy Howlin's constituency in Wexford, for example, the design and construction of the new emergency department has eliminated a great deal of the pressure and stress in what was previously a very constrained and confined emergency department. A number of modular units will be put in place as extensions to existing emergency departments in some hospitals to relieve pressure. Members are aware that the population of this country is ageing. We must think in terms of 2020, 2030 and even 2040. By 2040 Ireland may have 1 million additional people and will need 0.5 million extra houses. We will also have to deal with our ageing population in the context of hospital locations, primary care centres, community homes and so forth. That is all part of a ten year capital programme in which everyone will have to be involved because Ireland's current health facilities will have to be radically different in ten years' time.	spk_125

Maidir leis an mbuiséad, beidh na díospóireachtaí ar siúl go luath i dtreo is go mbeidh buiséad curtha os comhair na Dála i mí Dheireadh Fómhair.Tá a fhios ag an Teachta freisin gur foilsíodh plean do scoileanna Gaeltachta le déanaí don chéad uair ó bunaíodh an Stát. Cuireadh fáilte mhór roimh an bplean sin. Tá na scoileanna Gaeltachta ag breathnú ar céard gur chóir dóibh a dhéanamh chun buntáistí an phlean a bhaint amach agus ar conas is féidir leo gabháil leis na coinníollacha faoin bplean. Sílim gur mhaith an rud é sin.

Sílim gur mhaith an tuairim atá ag an Teachta Martin ansin. As part of the 2017 budget the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs retains the majority of the €18 million current funding for 2017. That is now part of the base line for the arts division of the Department meaning that it will be available for future years also. This included a €5 million increase for the Arts Council; an 8% increase in its annual budget; a boost in funding for all the national cultural institutions; €2 million to allow for the opening of the newly restored wings of the National Gallery of Ireland, which is due to open in the next few weeks; the opening of Killarney House on foot of significant capital investment by the State - €5 million or €6 million was invested in it; an increase of €2 million for the Irish Film Board; €1 million for Culture Ireland; and funding of €5 million for the implementation of the Creative Ireland programme, which was mentioned. Aosdána is a unique initiative established by the Arts Council in 1981 to honour creative artists who made a significant contribution to the arts in Ireland. There are currently 250 members in Aosdána: seven new members came into its membership last week. The scheme is the responsibility of the Arts Council and not of the Department. It should be noted that under section 24(2) of the Arts Act 2003, the council is independent of the Minister in its funding decisions. Members of Aosdána can quality for a means tested payment known as the cnuas, to which Deputy Howlin referred, if they are resident in Ireland and are full-time practising artists. Following recent internal audits of Aosdána and a value for money policy review of the Arts Council, which was undertaken under the guidance of an expert steering committee chaired by Dr. John O'Hagan, the Arts Council is reviewing all aspects of the administration and procedures of Aosdána to ensure that the most appropriate governance and oversight arrangements are in place. In regard to any issues which arise from the review, these are a matter for the Arts Council and Aosdána. I do not like to see such rows-----	spk_159

A Programme for a Partnership Government, published last May, set out an ambitious programme of work to protect our growing economy and ensure that the results of the recovery are felt by all citizens. The programme for Government annual report was published last week on 10 May and sets out the progress made on more than 300 commitments across all of Government over the past 12 months. It reflects the hard work across all Government Departments to deliver a wide range of issues over the lifetime of this Government. Prior to this, two interim progress reports on the programme were also published during the Government's first year in office. The annual report provides a comprehensive update on the progress of the commitments in its first year, which highlights very specific plans which have been put in place to address, in the short and longer term, key areas of housing, homelessness, education, rural and regional development, job creation, broadband, agriculture and climate change. The report also highlights the ambition and steps to improve services for families, children, people with disabilities and mental health problems and older people, including key reforms necessary in the health and justice sectors. Significant work has also been undertaken in advance of and following the UK's referendum on EU membership to ensure an effective whole of government approach to the Brexit negotiations that takes full account of the Government's negotiating priorities. The Government will continue to implement its programme, striking a balance between addressing urgent priorities and engaging in long-term planning so that lasting solutions are implemented to secure a strong economy and a fair society.	spk_166

#EndaKenny	2017-05-17	dail	32	Cabinet Committee Meetings	dbsect_7	Tá a fhios ag an Teachta go maith go bhfuil an coiste seo ag breathnú ar na nithe seo. Maidir leis an mbuiséad, beidh na díospóireachtaí ar siúl go luath i dtreo is go mbeidh buiséad curtha os comhair na Dála i mí Dheireadh Fómhair.Tá a fhios ag an Teachta freisin gur foilsíodh plean do scoileanna Gaeltachta le déanaí don chéad uair ó bunaíodh an Stát. Cuireadh fáilte mhór roimh an bplean sin. Tá na scoileanna Gaeltachta ag breathnú ar céard gur chóir dóibh a dhéanamh chun buntáistí an phlean a bhaint amach agus ar conas is féidir leo gabháil leis na coinníollacha faoin bplean. Sílim gur mhaith an rud é sin. I mí Eanáir na bliana 2014, foilsíodh trí fhógra faoi Acht na Gaeilge i leith na limistéar seo a leanas: Ciarraí thiar, Cois Fharraige, agus Gaoth Dobhair, Rann na Feirste, Anagaire agus Loch an Iúir. I mí an Mheithimh 2014, foilsíodh sé fhógra i leith na limistéar seo a leanas: Gaeltacht na nDéise, Ciarraí theas, An Cheathrú Rua, Ceantar na nOileán, Dún na nGall theas, agus Cloch Cheann Fhaola, Gort a' Choirce, An Fál Carrach agus Machaire Rabhartaigh. I mí Feabhra 2015, foilsíodh ceithre fhógra i leith na limistéar seo a leanas: Árainn Mhór, lár-Chonamara, Múscraí, agus Dúiche Sheoigheach agus Tuar Mhic Éadaigh. I mí Mheán Fómhair 2015, foilsíodh cúig fhógra i leith na limistéar seo a leanas: tuaisceart Dhún na nGall, Oileán Thoraí, Oileáin Árann, Maigh Eo thuaidh, agus Ráth Chairn agus Baile Ghib. I mí Iúil na bliana 2016, foilsíodh cheithre fhógra i leith na limistéar seo a leanas: Oileán Chléire, Maigh Eo thiar, na Rosa agus Maigh Cuilinn. I mí na Samhna na bliana 2016, foilsíodh fógra i leith Gaeltacht an Láir i gContae Dhún na nGall. Tá sé i gceist go gcuirfear tús le hullmhúcháin na bpleananna teanga idir seo agus deireadh na bliana sa trí limistéir Ghaeltachta eile atá fágtha ag an bpointe seo. Tá súil agam go bhfeicfidh an Teachta go bhfuil próiseas cuimsitheach i gceist anseo. Aithníodh sa Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge go mbeadh cur chuige céimneach i gceist chun bearta éagsúla na straitéise a chur i gcrích. Foilsíodh na critéir phleanála teanga i mí Mheán Fómhair na bliana 2013 agus foilsíodh na treoirlínte pleanála teanga i mí Eanáir na bliana 2014. Is léir mar sin go raibh obair leanúnach ar siúl ag an Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gnóthaí Réigiúnacha, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta chun raon leathan gníomhachtaí faoin straitéis a chur i bhfeidhm. Más rud é go bhfuil an tréimhse de dhá bhliain nó mar sin a ceadaíodh i leith gach aon cheann de na limistéir úd chun plean a ullmhú caite nó ag teacht chun deiridh, ag brath ar an gcás tá pleananna teanga i leith na limistéir Cois Fharraige, Gaoth Dobhair agus mar sin-----	spk_128

#EndaKenny	2017-05-17	dail	32	Cabinet Committee Meetings	dbsect_7	Ba chóir go mbeadh seans ag an Choimisinéir Teanga teacht os comhair Choiste na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus na nOileán agus a thuairimí a nochtadh faoi Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla. Sílim gur mhaith an tuairim atá ag an Teachta Martin ansin. As part of the 2017 budget the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs retains the majority of the €18 million current funding for 2017. That is now part of the base line for the arts division of the Department meaning that it will be available for future years also. This included a €5 million increase for the Arts Council; an 8% increase in its annual budget; a boost in funding for all the national cultural institutions; €2 million to allow for the opening of the newly restored wings of the National Gallery of Ireland, which is due to open in the next few weeks; the opening of Killarney House on foot of significant capital investment by the State - €5 million or €6 million was invested in it; an increase of €2 million for the Irish Film Board; €1 million for Culture Ireland; and funding of €5 million for the implementation of the Creative Ireland programme, which was mentioned. Aosdána is a unique initiative established by the Arts Council in 1981 to honour creative artists who made a significant contribution to the arts in Ireland. There are currently 250 members in Aosdána: seven new members came into its membership last week. The scheme is the responsibility of the Arts Council and not of the Department. It should be noted that under section 24(2) of the Arts Act 2003, the council is independent of the Minister in its funding decisions. Members of Aosdána can quality for a means tested payment known as the cnuas, to which Deputy Howlin referred, if they are resident in Ireland and are full-time practising artists. Following recent internal audits of Aosdána and a value for money policy review of the Arts Council, which was undertaken under the guidance of an expert steering committee chaired by Dr. John O'Hagan, the Arts Council is reviewing all aspects of the administration and procedures of Aosdána to ensure that the most appropriate governance and oversight arrangements are in place. In regard to any issues which arise from the review, these are a matter for the Arts Council and Aosdána. I do not like to see such rows-----	spk_159

#EndaKenny	2017-05-17	dail	32	Programme for Government Implementation	dbsect_8	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 10, inclusive, together. A Programme for a Partnership Government, published last May, set out an ambitious programme of work to protect our growing economy and ensure that the results of the recovery are felt by all citizens. The programme for Government annual report was published last week on 10 May and sets out the progress made on more than 300 commitments across all of Government over the past 12 months. It reflects the hard work across all Government Departments to deliver a wide range of issues over the lifetime of this Government. Prior to this, two interim progress reports on the programme were also published during the Government's first year in office. The annual report provides a comprehensive update on the progress of the commitments in its first year, which highlights very specific plans which have been put in place to address, in the short and longer term, key areas of housing, homelessness, education, rural and regional development, job creation, broadband, agriculture and climate change. The report also highlights the ambition and steps to improve services for families, children, people with disabilities and mental health problems and older people, including key reforms necessary in the health and justice sectors. Significant work has also been undertaken in advance of and following the UK's referendum on EU membership to ensure an effective whole of government approach to the Brexit negotiations that takes full account of the Government's negotiating priorities. The Government will continue to implement its programme, striking a balance between addressing urgent priorities and engaging in long-term planning so that lasting solutions are implemented to secure a strong economy and a fair society.	spk_166

Enterprise Ireland companies created 19,200 jobs, an increase of 9,000. Local enterprise office client companies created 7,800 jobs. The value of goods exported totalled almost €117 billion, the highest annual total on record. There are 12,500 small and medium enterprises that have benefited from €544 million in Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland loans. The credit guarantee scheme has sanctioned 437 loans of €70 million to date, supporting 2,500 jobs. Microfinance Ireland approved 1,249 applications, totalling €8.2 million. The list goes on for people if they want to read it. The Minister, Deputy Ross, has engaged extensively at official level with other Departments and agencies and he has been fully briefed in these engagements.

#EndaKenny	2017-05-17	dail	32	Programme for Government Implementation	dbsect_8	People judge Governments by the extent of legislation that is put through. The previous Government had a big majority and there were guillotines about which Deputy Martin complained every week. There was no real pre-legislative scrutiny. That has all been changed and half the agenda is determined by the Business Committee. There are 140 Private Members' Bills backed up and there are no guillotines. There is full and comprehensive pre-legislative scrutiny. Last year there was the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2016, the Health (Amendment) Act 2016, the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2016, the Proceeds of Crime Act (Amendment) 2016, the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act 2016-----	spk_208

#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I can agree with Deputy Martin when he says workers should be treated with dignity and respect, as they should be. This decision, however, was made by a commercial semi-State body and it is not the subject of direct instruction from the Government. If I am correct, my understanding is a very substantial amount of briquettes are unsold because of the change in the nature of the way things are now. This decision has been pondered for some time. The Deputy states the redundancy package is not acceptable and I do not have the details of what that means. In respect of workers being treated properly with dignity and respect, I share the Deputy's view completely. Deputy Martin will appreciate that Bord na Móna is phasing out the manufacturing of peat briquettes over the next number of years. There was the closure of the Bellacorick station quite a number of years ago, as well as a number of others in the midlands, as a result either of the bogs being cut away or very little being left, leading to a change of use either for hospitality or tourism purposes. Other issues have also been introduced. The facts and figures with respect to these two plants led to the board decision to close one; this was made on the basis of projections and so on. That does not mean the workers should not be treated with dignity and respect, as they should be. I hope they will be. If the issue is they are not being treated appropriately, it is a matter for the board. I hope it hears this message. With respect to what the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, committed to with a combined heat and power process at Littleton, I do not speak for promises made by him. Maybe in a moment of being overly enthusiastic as to what might be-----	spk_6
#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	In any event, it has not come true. I share the Deputy's view about dignity and respect. A substantial amount of product has not been sold, which is a clear issue. It is determined in part by the change in the nature of the way fossil fuels are treated and the new methods of energy use for domestic houses and commercial premises.	spk_9
#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I know.	spk_11
#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	Derrinlough was chosen as the sole location for future peat briquette production and the new biomass briquette plant. The review of peat operations was prompted by the very significant decline in sales in the past few years. If the product is being produced but not sold and there is no capacity to sell it, it just sits there. That is not the way it should be. Increased competition, consumer trends, lower oil prices, carbon tax and other factors have all resulted in a serious drop in sales in the past four years. There has been no date determined for closure. There is to be an orderly wind down and the opportunity to engage in new training and acquire new skills or other options for the staff who work in Littleton. When the review was concluded, it was stated that in order to sustain the business in the future the Derrinlough plant, at which 61 people are employed, would be the optimum location for future investment to secure the future of the fuels business. The head of Bord na Móna fuels said: This has been a very difficult decision following a period of uncertainty for employees. We took a great deal of care with this review to ensure that a wide range of factors were taken into account. Briquette sales have declined significantly in the past few years as we have encountered unprecedented market, financial and regulatory challenges. Ultimately we had to make a decision.I take the Deputy's point. Bord na Móna is engaging with the employees. I hope it will take on board the view of this House that all of the workers should be treated with respect and dignity and that all options for them should be explored thoroughly, as I would expect Bord na Móna to do in the time ahead. I will not comment any further on the commitment entered into by the former Minister.	spk_17

#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	"Maybe Deputy Adams and I could form an unprecedented unique partnership when he leaves. He might advise me. In respect of the Single Market, Mr. Barnier spoke here last week and outlined his views on the outcome of the European Council, the paper from the European Commission and the recommendations from the European Parliament. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland want access to the Single Market, and the Republic of Ireland is in the Single Market and will remain so. As we are speaking today, we do not what know the outcome of the trading negotiations that will apply will be. If, for instance, there are no tariffs between Ireland and Britain, Northern Ireland and the Republic or the UK and the European Union, there are still two different jurisdictions and some arrangement to deal with that will have to be made. The point of agreement by the British Government is that there will not be a return to customs posts as we all knew them many years ago along the Border. The agreement politically is that whatever the outcome on the trading relationship, a different way of dealing with this would have to be found. It is not impossible to have a situation like that to which Deputy Adams referred. The phrases ""unique circumstance"", ""particular and specific circumstances"" and ""special cases"" have been repeated in respect of Northern Ireland. That is why we have the peace process, peace funds and agreement on a range of areas about what should happen with Northern Ireland.  We do not yet have a Northern Executive, and I hope that after the British general election the parties will sit down and put an Executive together before the end of June. That will not sort out this problem, but at least we might have common ground that Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Executive and the parties do not want a return to the border of the past with hard customs posts. Nor does the Republic, and we are not going to have that.However, we do not know the answer to the question of whether there will be tariffs and, if so, to what extent. Even if there are no tariffs, there will still be two jurisdictions, namely, the European Union and the United Kingdom. As the Deputy is well aware, the Six Counties belong to the United Kingdom and will remain so under the Good Friday Agreement until the people decide by their vote, consent and democratic means to change it. If it becomes a reality, it will be accepted by both Governments and recognised by the European Union. Until such time as the divorce proceedings deal with borders, modalities, potential liabilities, citizens' rights and reciprocal rights, we will not get into the detail and complexity of what will arise."	spk_27
#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I happen to know what the position is. An agreement has been reached with the European Council that Ireland will be recognised as having particular and unique circumstances which apply to it. The European Council has also recognised that it has no intention of returning to a hard border. Deputy Gerry Adams says there will be no tariffs, but he is not in a position to do so, given that negotiations on the issue have not yet commenced. I am telling the Deputy that even if there were no tariffs, we would still have two jurisdictions, namely, the European Union and the United Kingdom. There might be customs checks at Pembroke or Holyhead. If one looks at eastern European countries where border checks applied in the recent past, there were eight and ten hour delays. That is not what we want as it leads to inefficiencies, inordinate delays, paperwork, jobs issues and all the rest. We do not want that. We have a situation where freight and machinery can move throughout Europe on the basis of the invoices alone. That is the Single Market. The British Government is stating it wants to have as close as possible a relationship with the European Union, albeit that is what we now have. The British Government made the decision that it wanted out of the Single Market and a changed status in respect of a customs union. These are matters which have not even been talked about in the detail that will lead to negotiations. The first issue to be addressed, as Mr. Barnier pointed out here, consists of liabilities and modalities, what that means and whether there is a figure. The second issue is citizens' rights and reciprocal rights, while the third is the Border. We have all of these things while Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland want to be part of the Single Market. However, there is an aggregate vote, as a result of which the United Kingdom decided to leave and which is causing all kinds of trouble. In the next two and a half to three years an inordinate amount of political time will be taken up in dealing with something we did not wish for in the first place. However, we have to respect it and deal with the consequences.	spk_31
#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	The Deputy's solution is facile to say the least. She could have said 50,000, 70,000 or 100,000 because she seems to imagine housing can be conjured up just like that. She stated these things are not real. What is real is population growth of 3.8% which is greater than the growth in housing stock, which is 0.4%. The average household size has increased for the first time since 1966. Overall housing stock increased by a net 9,000 units. Respondents reported 33,436 units built, admittedly since 2011. I understand 23,000 families and individuals are on HAP schemes. That is a real figure but they are also real people, families and individuals assisted through HAP and living in their homes. The unusual thing is I never hear of anybody being interviewed who has been moved into a house with which they are happy with their families. It is if they never existed. They have been moved out of hotels and out of homelessness and into sustainable long-term housing conditions. It is as if they are just figures who moved off into the darkness.	spk_33
#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	Planning permission has been granted for 16,375 new homes. That is a real figure. Unlike Deputy Collins, we have to build the houses. This means when we have the planning permission we have to have somebody with the blocks, concrete and facilities to be able to build the houses. This is why rapid build housing has been part and parcel of the five pillars for housing we have here. Am I to understand when the Deputy says this that George's Place in Dún Laoghaire, which is of interest to Deputy Boyd Barrett-----	spk_35
#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	There are to be 12 homes provided there. In St. Aidan's in Brookfield in Tallaght, 71 homes-----	spk_37

#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	-----or that there is something there that is not real? There will be 24 homes built in Cherry Orchard, 30 in Mourne Road in Drimnagh, 39 in St. Helena's in Finglas, and so on. These are real sites, real opportunities and places where construction is under way to provide rapid build homes for people who need them. I admit there are challenges facing the Minister, Deputy Coveney, in addressing the question of not resorting to the use of hotels by the end of June. I think the Deputy referred to 800 families. My information from yesterday's Cabinet sub-committee meeting is that the figure is about 600 and my information from the housing department is that she will see a very substantial drop in that number by the end of June. It is always a very difficult challenge to meet because it is exceptionally ambitious but they are really focused on moving this along. As well as that, there are 28,000 vacant homes in the suburbs of Dublin. These are real dwellings but sometimes when one goes to look at them the figures might not be as accurate. There are 750 in the Finglas area but sometimes these are not habitable and have to be brought back to a good shape, and there are incentives and opportunities to do that, whether they be public or private houses.	spk_41
#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	Yes, and that is part of the five pillars set out by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, in his programme. The State land mapping process has concluded that there are over 700 local authority and Housing Agency owned sites-----	spk_44

#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	The position is that local authorities are now tasked with preparing strategic plans to get on with that business.

#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	This Government has given money, facilities and incentives to local authorities to do their job. For instance, we are now making rental a more attractive proposition for investors. The Department of Finance has set up a working group on the tax and fiscal treatment of landlords, which includes officials from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government. We are taking action to bring vacant properties back into use. The repair and lease scheme, under which local authorities will refurbish vacant properties and lease them from their owners, was rolled out in February. That is real. That will deliver 3,500 properties by 2021. It will cost €150 million. They are making money available through the Housing Finance Agency to higher education institutes. They can now borrow money to build student accommodation, which will free up those houses where students are currently located.We support the build-to-rent development through pathfinder sites. In February, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, launched major infrastructural works at the Cherrywood site in Dublin, costing €35 million. We have requested the local authorities in rent pressure zones to use publicly owned sites to kickstart supply. In that regard, Dublin City Council brought forward a land initiative covering the three sites, at O'Devaney Gardens, Oscar Traynor Road and St. Michael's in Inchicore. They are seeking partners to deliver a mix of social, affordable and private housing. These are all real aspects of the progress being made in terms of housing.	spk_50
#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	"The Deputy raised questions about potential corruption, bugging and accountability, and she raised the most distressing issue of all, which was the video of a young woman who is no longer with us. We share the grief of her family over the tragedy. That matter is being investigated as a matter of urgency by the Garda. I understand from reports that the footage was taken on a mobile phone.The Deputy made her point about that. She also made a point about bugging, an issue of particular importance and on which I have read the newspaper reports. As the Deputy will be well aware, there is a designated judge who deals with the question of listening to particular individuals. The Deputy does not comment on any of these cases because they are small in number. I have the last report from 10 November last year by Mr. Justice Paul McDermott in front of me. He states:2. On 27th October, 2016 I attended at the Office of the Department of Justice and Equality ... and met with officials who made available to me documents and records relating to the operation of the Acts, as requested. I examined the files and records furnished and spoke to the officials responsible for the operation of the Acts and liaison with other authorities in respect of same. All documents requested by me were furnished and all questions posed by me in relation to the files and records produced were answered to my satisfaction.3. On 27th October, 2016 I attended at the headquarters of An Garda Síochána ... I met with officers and personnel responsible for the operation of the above Acts. I examined computer records and hard copy tiles relating to the operation of the above Acts which were made available for my inspection and all documents and records which I requested were furnished and examined. All questions posed by me in relation to the operation of the Acts and the documents and records produced were answered to my satisfaction.He concludes: ""I am satisfied having examined the records and documents produced to me and from the information conveyed to me at these meetings that the relevant State authorities are in compliance with the provisions of the above Acts as of the date of this report"". What the Deputy referred to in respect of allegations of bugging goes back quite a number of years. I do not have the date, but obviously there was a situation where there were different Ministers for Justice for quite a long time. In respect of bugging, this is a very serious matter and the Minister for Justice and Equality of the day is not in a position to order that an individual be eavesdropped upon using telecommunications without having an official of the Department verify in the first instance that it would comply with the Act and that it would be overseen by the High Court judge with responsibility for this matter. There is a lot of stuff in the ether about which I would like to know the facts. As I understand it, the case the Deputy mentioned went before the courts not for bugging or eavesdropping but for personal injuries. It was a different matter and this was an element of the case. Be that as it may, it is a very serious allegation. I am giving the Deputy the result of the judge's most recent report on compliance with the Act in so far as the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda Síochána are concerned. All of the evidence, files and computers were made available and all of the questions were answered to the satisfaction of the judge. The Commissioner of An Garda Síochána is the Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote. She is responsible to the Committee of Public Accounts for dealing with the Vote. The matter is being investigated by the committee and it is not for me or the Deputy to interfere with its work. In law, the Commissioner is responsible to the Committee of Public Accounts as Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote and we should let the committee do its work."	spk_52
#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	On the Deputy's comment on dysfunctionality, this morning the Government approved the commission on the future of policing in Ireland with detailed terms of reference and a list of people who have great experience in the law, policing and other elements of society. The commission's report is not being asked for in 15 months. There will be a rolling report whereby the commission can make recommendations, on which the Government will act, on a regular basis. In other words, as recommendations come through in respect of policing, they can be dealt with by the Government, instead of waiting a full 15 or 18 months for a final report. The terms of reference are good, detailed and exact and the commission will give a different impetus to the way the culture in the Garda evolves. The independent Policing Authority recently made an appointment as a new assistant commissioner of a policeman whom I happen to know from his work in the north inner city. He is the kind of person the Deputy would be proud to have appointed by an independent body. He has done his work in difficult circumstances in the past few years.The Deputy shakes her head. Maybe she does not agree. The fact of the matter is that no senior appointment to the gardaí in future will be made by anything to do with any Commissioner or anything to do with any Government, but by an independent Policing Authority, which is the way that it should be.	spk_54

#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	Order of Business	dbsect_3	This legislation is very important. Ireland is well ahead in dealing with data protection, which is being handled by the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy. The heads of this Bill were approved by the Cabinet last week. The issues mentioned by the Deputy can be raised, dealt with and teased out when the Bill goes for pre-legislative scrutiny. In light of the nature and scale of investment in this country by multinational companies that have extensive assets in digitised material, we need to be fully compliant in respect of this issue so that we will be ready for the new directive from the European Commission, which will kick in during January of next year. That means we will have to enhance the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, which we have changed and funded and to which we have provided experienced personnel. Further enhancement of that office might be needed, given the nature of the cases that might arise. The heads of this important Bill were approved last week. It will go for pre-legislative scrutiny. I am quite sure the Deputy's comments will be treated with proper respect in that context.	spk_148

#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	EU Meetings	dbsect_8	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.I travelled to The Hague on 21 April 2017 for a meeting with the Dutch Prime Minister, Mr. Mark Rutte, and the Danish Prime Minister, Mr. Lars Løkke Rasmussen. Our discussions were largely focused on Brexit, but we also touched briefly on EU-US relations. The meeting took place in the context of the Government's ongoing programme of strategic engagement on Brexit and was the latest in a series of meetings with my EU counterparts. I also met recently my counterparts in Germany, Belgium, Poland and Spain and the Presidents of the EU institutions and the head of the Brexit task force who was in Dublin last week. I have written to congratulate Mr. Emmanuel Macron on his election as President of the Republic of France. The meeting in The Hague provided an opportunity to share our views on the issues arising from Brexit ahead of the adoption of the European Union's negotiating guidelines by the European Council on 9 April. Ireland has much in common with the Netherlands and Denmark, not just in terms of geographic proximity and strong trade and export relations with the United Kingdom but also in terms of shared perspectives on the importance of a liberal EU trade policy. Although Ireland, the Netherlands and Denmark are more likely than other partners to be negatively affected by the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union, we agreed on the importance of maintaining the EU27 unity that has marked our approach until now. I also took the opportunity at the meeting, as I do in all my bilateral engagements, to explain in some detail our unique concerns arising from Brexit, including protecting the peace process, avoiding a hard border and maintaining the common travel area with the United Kingdom. I outlined the particular implications for Ireland, North and South, and also described recent political developments in Northern Ireland. I am pleased that Ireland's unique concerns have been fully reflected in the guidelines that outline the European Union's approach to the withdrawal negotiations.In this context, I am very grateful for the understanding and support of my Dutch and Danish counterparts, and all of my EU counterparts, as we progress work on these important and sensitive issues. It will be important to continue working with like-minded partners such as The Netherlands and Denmark and in the future to proactively defend our shared perspectives in the face of new voting majorities in the European Union. In the months and years ahead we are determined to protect and advance our interests, both within and through the European Union on the wider global stage.	spk_198
#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	EU Meetings	dbsect_8	I thank the Deputy for his comment on continuing connections with small states which is very important. The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Dara Murphy, has on several occasions been to all member states, particularly the small member states because of the implications of Brexit. As Deputy Brendan Howlin is aware, most of the economic reports indicate that the countries most adversely affected would be Ireland, The Netherlands and Denmark. I have already had a meeting with Prime Minister Michel of Belgium and we want to keep these contacts alive. I wrote to President Macron following his election and said we would be most affected by a hard Brexit and that we would appreciate and count on France's continued support in addressing the unique challenges we faced. I made the point that Ireland and France had always had a very warm relationship. France is a big buyer of food, services and so on from Ireland and we want to maintain that position. I do not favour having a federal Europe. Given how near the European Union has been to collapse in the recent period, the electorates in The Netherlands and France and in Austria with the election of its President appear to be refocusing on Europe. I see the same happening in the latest results in Germany which is moving towards a pro-European party. The Germans will make their choice in federal elections in September and I expect the Chancellor, Dr. Merkel, to be returned again. Given that there will more than likely be a very strong alliance between Germany and France and, as Deputy Brendan Howlin is aware, that the real reason for setting up the European Economic Community was to prevent the historic difficulties between France and Germany, it is important from the European Union point of view that there be strong countries which work with small countries for everybody's benefit.	spk_200
#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	EU Meetings	dbsect_8	He made his comments in Germany. The Chancellor said some of these things could be considered, but we have always taken the view, as the Deputy did when he was President of the Council, that whatever views are put forward, Ireland is quite prepared to consider and talk about these things. However, we have very clear lines that we do not cross. On his first visit to Berlin as the new President, Mr. Macron set out several issues. We should wait and see how they are presented in more detail and then talk about them. We saw this happen before with the common consolidated corporate tax base and transaction taxes. Ireland has always had the capacity to say let us see what is on the line and talk about it. we then find out that other countries have similar views, for or against. That is how it works. I have never favoured having a federal Union.	spk_202
#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	EU Meetings	dbsect_8	I do actually. The Good Friday Agreement predates the decision on Brexit by 19 years and we have been very much at pains to point out that the Brexit referendum result does not influence, tinker with, or change the Good Friday Agreement in any way. As the two Governments are co-guarantors of the Agreement, we want it to be implemented in full. Protecting the gains of the peace process in Northern Ireland is one of the Government's front-line priorities in dealing with the impact of Brexit. That hard won peace which was founded on the Good Friday Agreement cannot be compromised. The Government will continue to ensure the EU-UK negotiations will take full account of the all-island issues and Northern Ireland, including ensuring the Good Friday Agreement is fully respected and upheld and that an open border is maintained. That is our position. I agree that the Good Friday Agreement is an internationally binding agreement which was brought together after many years of troubles. Those who put it together were visionary in the way they set it out. It was not written to be influenced by Brexit and the Brexit referendum result does not impact on it. We have maintained that separation very clearly in our discussions at European level.	spk_204
#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	EU Meetings	dbsect_8	I did not hear the remarks of Secretary Davis. I note the judgment of the European Court of Justice today in respect of Singapore. That means that the EU-Singapore free trade agreement is a mixed agreement and there are elements which are of national competence and require national ratification. The same applies to the CETA agreement with Canada, which is a mixed agreement and will require national ratification in due course. In that case, we favour provisional ratification in order to ensure the deal works which is the best way of demonstrating the practical benefits for consumers and SMEs. Deputy Martin is correct when he said we have to have the details sooner. It means that all parliaments will have to have international trade committees so that they are not left without adequate information as negotiations on trade deals proceed. This matter has been raised in the House. Deputies have said they do not know what is in an agreement, despite the fact that the information might be on a website or have been published in book form. Such agreements can be very complicated, as the Deputy knows. If there has to be ratification by all of the parliaments, that will probably delay the process but may have a benefit in that parliaments would be informed on a rolling basis of what is being discussed so that their international free trade committees or whatever else would be very well-informed about the process. We have dealt in considerable detail with our counterparts in London and Belfast in respect of the Border issues. Deputy Martin is aware that the three issues are the Border, modalities and liabilities about whatever contractual obligations the United Kingdom has from joining the European Union and rights and reciprocal rights for people who live in European countries. Since 1922, we have dealt on a bilateral basis with Britain via the common travel area, which does not involve just travel but also residency, the right to work and social protection and benefits. The British Government has agreed with what we have said, namely that there is no return to the Border of the past. We still do not know what the future structure of trade will be or what is being proposed by the United Kingdom with the European Union. That is where the complexities will lie. We will not get to that issue until there is substantial progress on the first three priorities I outlined. We have a political 	spk_206
#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	EU Meetings	dbsect_8	I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 8, inclusive, together. I spoke to Prime Minister May by phone on 18 April following the announcement of her plans to hold a general election in the UK. We discussed the upcoming Brexit negotiations and I reiterated our commitment to ensuring the best possible outcome for Ireland while negotiating as an integral part of the EU 27 team. We also discussed the need to recognise the close trading links between our intertwined economies and re-affirmed our commitment to an open Border and the retention of the common travel area. We discussed the political situation in Northern Ireland and noted that the election would have a direct impact on the timing of the ongoing talks process. I expressed the hope that the talks could continue to a successful conclusion and I emphasised to the Prime Minister that a return to direct rule in Northern Ireland could not be contemplated. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, had a range of contacts with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the political parties regarding the merits of continuing structured talks in the context of an election campaign. There was a widespread view that, given the demands and constraints of the election campaign, the best course was to pause the current talks until after the general election takes place on 8 June. The new legislative deadline for forming the Executive is 29 June. There will, therefore, be sufficient opportunity after 8 June for talks to resume and for the parties, with the appropriate support and involvement of the two Governments, to re-engage on the urgent task of forming a new Executive and taking forward the implementation of outstanding commitments from previous agreements. It is critically important to see devolved government restored and working effectively in the interests of the people of Northern Ireland, in particular in the context of Brexit. As a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government is determined to uphold its principles and protect its institutions. We will continue to work to this end with the British Government to support and facilitate the parties in their efforts to reach agreement.	spk_207
#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	EU Meetings	dbsect_8	In reply to Deputy Adams's opening question, I note that the date for the inquest in respect of the ten civilians killed in Ballymurphy is September of next year. I commend everyone who was so committed through their tragedy to seeing that a date would be fixed for the commencement of an inquest. The Dáil adopted an all-party motion in 2015 in support of the Ballymurphy families who continue to seek an effective inquiry into the incident in which those 11 people died. It is one of the 56 legacy inquest cases from the Troubles which are still waiting to proceed in Northern Ireland and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, continues to raise the matter. I hope that in the new situation here and given the fact that we had Fresh Start in Stormont, I genuinely believe that contains the opportunity in its own way to deal with these legacy issues, sensitive and raw though they may be and will be when these things come to light. The timely holding of inquests is an effective part of the right to life as set out in Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights. At least, a commencement date has been fixed and is known, which is an important element. In reply to Deputy Howlin, he knows what the options are. Either there is an election-----	spk_211
#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	EU Meetings	dbsect_8	-----direct rule, or an Executive is formed. I hope the parties will now focus on the fact that they will be sitting down again a day or two after the result of a British general election in which it is estimated the Prime Minister will receive a very much enhanced majority over the one delivered in the last election. For that to happen, the parties have to want it to happen. That means, in particular, that the DUP and Sinn Féin must have a belief that they can put an Executive together. Of course, there are different political opinions and differences of emphasis in a whole range of areas, but that is no reason the parties cannot create an Executive to look at the question of distribution of finances for people to get on about their business. There is the whole issue of Brexit here, as well as those of the agrisector, trade unions and businesses. The people from Northern Ireland who voiced their opinions at the all-island civic forum on two occasions must be represented. They need an Executive to add to the voice of Government here in dealing with the outcome of Brexit when the negotiations start. I hope the two main parties will decide, irrespective of the differences they have, that it is imperative to put an Executive in place. I hope, and I have to believe, that will happen before the end of June.	spk_213
#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	EU Meetings	dbsect_8	"Deputy Martin raised a very important point about the very good relations, with a few notable exceptions, between Ireland and Downing Street. Those have been very strong in the last number of years. I must note, also, that there is regular engagement at the very highest official level between here and Downing Street on all of these issues. I am sorry the Executive was collapsed and that a replacement was not created. Irrespective of how good or strong it was, it is better to have one than not. The only other options for the Secretary of State are to have more elections or to have direct rule.The Executive is the best option of those. As I said to Deputy Howlin, if the DUP and Sinn Féin do not want to have an Executive then it cannot be formed. They have got to accept their political responsibility. They are elected to an Assembly, the purpose of which under the Good Friday Agreement is to have an Executive to direct affairs for Northern Ireland. As the Deputy knows, this means the North-South Ministerial Council, all of the different councils that can come from it, the issues that will arise because of cross-Border organisations and the administration that entails. Look at Brexit now. We will have to deal with the road to Derry and other cross-Border activities. The Government has opened a European Investment Bank office with a view to having major infrastructural projects which have streams of income to pay off those loans. That will involve, if we want to operate on a cross-Border basis, consultation with somebody. I would prefer to have an Executive of whatever shape or form that at least we could engage with properly and formally. Deputy Martin raises a central issue here. The Executive is gone. It was collapsed and has not been restored. I hope in the two or three days after the British election that Deputy Adams will instruct his leader in the North, Ms O'Neill, and the DUP to get together, as these two parties are in a position to form an Executive in the interests of the peoples of Northern Ireland. The answer to Deputy Burton's question is ""Yes"". We must have opportunities for engagement, as Deputy Martin pointed out, at official level but also at bilateral level. There will be issues that will have to be teased out, as the Deputy well knows from long experience. Ireland will be with the EU 26 in the formal negotiations being conducted by Michelle Barnier. In the course of the discussions there will, of course, be issues that arise that are best understood by the British and Irish because we have been dealing with them for very many years, and we will have to have the opportunity to engage bilaterally. Mr. Barnier will understand this as a complement or as a supplement to the formal negotiations he will lead on behalf of the European Union. The Deputy is right when she says there will be issues that will arise that may be specific and complicated and that will need to be teased out to arrive at a compromise between the Irish and English, so the answer to the question is ""Yes""."	spk_216
#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	EU Meetings	dbsect_8	I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 to 12, inclusive, together. As I outlined last week in my statement to the House, I attended the meeting of the European Council on 29 April. This was the first meeting since Prime Minister May formally notified the European Union of the UK's intention to leave, thereby triggering Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, and it was, therefore, a meeting of the 27 remaining member states. We adopted the EU negotiating guidelines, and had a broad-ranging discussion about the process ahead. Presidents Tusk and Juncker also outlined the process and timelines around the relocation of the two EU agencies currently located in the UK. I was pleased with the outcome of the meeting, including the overall EU approach to the withdrawal negotiations, and the acknowledgement of the need to address Ireland's unique concerns, as set out in the guidelines. I was also very pleased with the declaration which was agreed by the European Council, which provides reassurance that no provision of the Good Friday Agreement, including the provision relating to unity, will be undermined by the UK departure from the EU. It was by no means a given that Ireland’s position would be seen as a priority for the negotiations but, thanks to our strategic, persistent and patient work, and the understanding and support of our European partners, Ireland's specific concerns were fully acknowledged in the guidelines. Supporting and protecting the achievements, benefits and commitments of the peace process; avoiding a hard border; and protecting the common travel area will now be addressed as priorities in the exit negotiations. There was no discussion about the future of the EU at this April meeting of the European Council, but it has been considered and discussed at a number of meetings, including informal meetings of the European Council in Bratislava, in Brussels, in Malta and in Rome. In my discussions at these meetings, in my bilateral engagements with EU counterparts, and here in the House, I have consistently emphasised the need for the EU to focus on delivering for its citizens in areas where it can add real value. I have cautioned against pursuing deeper integration at this time and have instead recommended that we focus on where the EU is most effective, for example, in relation to the Single Market, the digital single market, jobs, growth and investment. I did not have any bilateral meetings at the European Council on 29 April, although I did of course engage with my counterparts at the meeting and informally on the margins.	spk_217
#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	EU Meetings	dbsect_8	"We have been consistent on that. The European agenda should not stop with Brexit. It has to go beyond that and the completion of the digital Single Market, capital markets and the EMU, is the agenda for the creation of millions of jobs both in Europe and beyond. That agenda is in place and has been followed, although not to completion because it contains a number of challenges that need to be dealt with. We participate very strongly on that and as the Deputy knows, the last Eurobarometer poll showed that 88% of Irish people supported the concept of European membership and Ireland continuing to be a member of the European Union. That is where we stay. I was glad to see the election of a French President who is clearly very much in favour of the continuation of the European Union because if that election had gone wrong and Marine Le Pen had been elected as President, withdrawing from the euro and from the European Union and dealing with the closing of borders would have created a fundamental collapse of the European Union itself. There is a retrenchment here in terms of what the European Union actually means now and I have to say that for the first time since I began to attend European Council meetings, and the first meeting was in Malta, people began to realise just what was at stake. Do they want to hold on to a European Union and a Single Market or do they not? The point made by Mr. Barnier last week was that it comes to a point where people begin to say, ""You have got 400 million or 500 million in a Single Market, freedom of movement of people, capital, services and all of that and do you want to throw it away for the sake of hundreds of thousands of jobs in small businesses?"" Obviously, that is not the case. We are very strongly in favour of the European Union and no other country, with respect to them, has the same solidarity as we have here because as the Leas Cheann-Comhairle will recall, in the middle of the recession we had to have a referendum on the fiscal stability treaty, which Deputy Howlin raised last week in terms of the fiscal rules. The people here could have given the Government a real kicking at the time but they decided that their place was with the euro, the eurozone and the European Union and they voted 60-40 in favour of that. Nobody here is in favour of treaties but sometimes if sovereignty is transferred in part to the European Union the Attorney General of the day makes a recommendation on whether a referendum is required. Mr. Barnier pointed out last week that if we have a situation where Britain withdraws from the Union and there is a €12 billion hole in the budget every year, the countries that are paying do not want to pay any more while the countries that are receiving do not want to receive any less, so what do we do? Do we force countries to pay more or do we force countries to cut programmes? We can imagine what could happen in a country like Ireland with the CAP and all the different schemes available for farmers, from the uplands down to the lowlands and the tillage schemes. I agree with Deputy Howlin because I believe there will be more emphasis on social Europe in the time ahead but we cannot have these ghettos or  Deputy Haughey raised the Franco-German relationship. I believe that will be very strong. Clearly, two big countries with big economies will get their way in the vast majority of cases and therefore relationships between small countries and the likes of France and Germany will be of particular importance. It was always my view that the European Union thrived when big countries worked with small countries in the interests of everybody. If we are all equal as citizens in the European Union and if everybody is to have the same opportunity, small countries need that opportunity. Deputy Haughey is right that there will be a cementing of that relationship and in that sense we will have to face change, but we should face it with courage. It does not always mean that there will be treaties but we should never be afraid to talk about the issues on the table because we might find we have many allies in small countries who would say this would not be in anybody's interest."	spk_224
#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_9	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.I travelled to The Hague on 21 April 2017 for a meeting with the Dutch Prime Minister, Mr. Mark Rutte, and the Danish Prime Minister, Mr. Lars Løkke Rasmussen. Our discussions were largely focused on Brexit, but we also touched briefly on EU-US relations. The meeting took place in the context of the Government's ongoing programme of strategic engagement on Brexit and was the latest in a series of meetings with my EU counterparts. I also met recently my counterparts in Germany, Belgium, Poland and Spain and the Presidents of the EU institutions and the head of the Brexit task force who was in Dublin last week. I have written to congratulate Mr. Emmanuel Macron on his election as President of the Republic of France. The meeting in The Hague provided an opportunity to share our views on the issues arising from Brexit ahead of the adoption of the European Union's negotiating guidelines by the European Council on 9 April. Ireland has much in common with the Netherlands and Denmark, not just in terms of geographic proximity and strong trade and export relations with the United Kingdom but also in terms of shared perspectives on the importance of a liberal EU trade policy. Although Ireland, the Netherlands and Denmark are more likely than other partners to be negatively affected by the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union, we agreed on the importance of maintaining the EU27 unity that has marked our approach until now. I also took the opportunity at the meeting, as I do in all my bilateral engagements, to explain in some detail our unique concerns arising from Brexit, including protecting the peace process, avoiding a hard border and maintaining the common travel area with the United Kingdom. I outlined the particular implications for Ireland, North and South, and also described recent political developments in Northern Ireland. I am pleased that Ireland's unique concerns have been fully reflected in the guidelines that outline the European Union's approach to the withdrawal negotiations.In this context, I am very grateful for the understanding and support of my Dutch and Danish counterparts, and all of my EU counterparts, as we progress work on these important and sensitive issues. It will be important to continue working with like-minded partners such as The Netherlands and Denmark and in the future to proactively defend our shared perspectives in the face of new voting majorities in the European Union. In the months and years ahead we are determined to protect and advance our interests, both within and through the European Union on the wider global stage.	spk_198
#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_9	I thank the Deputy for his comment on continuing connections with small states which is very important. The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Dara Murphy, has on several occasions been to all member states, particularly the small member states because of the implications of Brexit. As Deputy Brendan Howlin is aware, most of the economic reports indicate that the countries most adversely affected would be Ireland, The Netherlands and Denmark. I have already had a meeting with Prime Minister Michel of Belgium and we want to keep these contacts alive. I wrote to President Macron following his election and said we would be most affected by a hard Brexit and that we would appreciate and count on France's continued support in addressing the unique challenges we faced. I made the point that Ireland and France had always had a very warm relationship. France is a big buyer of food, services and so on from Ireland and we want to maintain that position. I do not favour having a federal Europe. Given how near the European Union has been to collapse in the recent period, the electorates in The Netherlands and France and in Austria with the election of its President appear to be refocusing on Europe. I see the same happening in the latest results in Germany which is moving towards a pro-European party. The Germans will make their choice in federal elections in September and I expect the Chancellor, Dr. Merkel, to be returned again. Given that there will more than likely be a very strong alliance between Germany and France and, as Deputy Brendan Howlin is aware, that the real reason for setting up the European Economic Community was to prevent the historic difficulties between France and Germany, it is important from the European Union point of view that there be strong countries which work with small countries for everybody's benefit.	spk_200
#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_9	He made his comments in Germany. The Chancellor said some of these things could be considered, but we have always taken the view, as the Deputy did when he was President of the Council, that whatever views are put forward, Ireland is quite prepared to consider and talk about these things. However, we have very clear lines that we do not cross. On his first visit to Berlin as the new President, Mr. Macron set out several issues. We should wait and see how they are presented in more detail and then talk about them. We saw this happen before with the common consolidated corporate tax base and transaction taxes. Ireland has always had the capacity to say let us see what is on the line and talk about it. we then find out that other countries have similar views, for or against. That is how it works. I have never favoured having a federal Union.	spk_202
#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_9	I do actually. The Good Friday Agreement predates the decision on Brexit by 19 years and we have been very much at pains to point out that the Brexit referendum result does not influence, tinker with, or change the Good Friday Agreement in any way. As the two Governments are co-guarantors of the Agreement, we want it to be implemented in full. Protecting the gains of the peace process in Northern Ireland is one of the Government's front-line priorities in dealing with the impact of Brexit. That hard won peace which was founded on the Good Friday Agreement cannot be compromised. The Government will continue to ensure the EU-UK negotiations will take full account of the all-island issues and Northern Ireland, including ensuring the Good Friday Agreement is fully respected and upheld and that an open border is maintained. That is our position. I agree that the Good Friday Agreement is an internationally binding agreement which was brought together after many years of troubles. Those who put it together were visionary in the way they set it out. It was not written to be influenced by Brexit and the Brexit referendum result does not impact on it. We have maintained that separation very clearly in our discussions at European level.	spk_204
#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_9	I did not hear the remarks of Secretary Davis. I note the judgment of the European Court of Justice today in respect of Singapore. That means that the EU-Singapore free trade agreement is a mixed agreement and there are elements which are of national competence and require national ratification. The same applies to the CETA agreement with Canada, which is a mixed agreement and will require national ratification in due course. In that case, we favour provisional ratification in order to ensure the deal works which is the best way of demonstrating the practical benefits for consumers and SMEs. Deputy Martin is correct when he said we have to have the details sooner. It means that all parliaments will have to have international trade committees so that they are not left without adequate information as negotiations on trade deals proceed. This matter has been raised in the House. Deputies have said they do not know what is in an agreement, despite the fact that the information might be on a website or have been published in book form. Such agreements can be very complicated, as the Deputy knows. If there has to be ratification by all of the parliaments, that will probably delay the process but may have a benefit in that parliaments would be informed on a rolling basis of what is being discussed so that their international free trade committees or whatever else would be very well-informed about the process. We have dealt in considerable detail with our counterparts in London and Belfast in respect of the Border issues. Deputy Martin is aware that the three issues are the Border, modalities and liabilities about whatever contractual obligations the United Kingdom has from joining the European Union and rights and reciprocal rights for people who live in European countries. Since 1922, we have dealt on a bilateral basis with Britain via the common travel area, which does not involve just travel but also residency, the right to work and social protection and benefits. The British Government has agreed with what we have said, namely that there is no return to the Border of the past. We still do not know what the future structure of trade will be or what is being proposed by the United Kingdom with the European Union. That is where the complexities will lie. We will not get to that issue until there is substantial progress on the first three priorities I outlined. We have a political 	spk_206
#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_10	I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 8, inclusive, together. I spoke to Prime Minister May by phone on 18 April following the announcement of her plans to hold a general election in the UK. We discussed the upcoming Brexit negotiations and I reiterated our commitment to ensuring the best possible outcome for Ireland while negotiating as an integral part of the EU 27 team. We also discussed the need to recognise the close trading links between our intertwined economies and re-affirmed our commitment to an open Border and the retention of the common travel area. We discussed the political situation in Northern Ireland and noted that the election would have a direct impact on the timing of the ongoing talks process. I expressed the hope that the talks could continue to a successful conclusion and I emphasised to the Prime Minister that a return to direct rule in Northern Ireland could not be contemplated. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, had a range of contacts with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the political parties regarding the merits of continuing structured talks in the context of an election campaign. There was a widespread view that, given the demands and constraints of the election campaign, the best course was to pause the current talks until after the general election takes place on 8 June. The new legislative deadline for forming the Executive is 29 June. There will, therefore, be sufficient opportunity after 8 June for talks to resume and for the parties, with the appropriate support and involvement of the two Governments, to re-engage on the urgent task of forming a new Executive and taking forward the implementation of outstanding commitments from previous agreements. It is critically important to see devolved government restored and working effectively in the interests of the people of Northern Ireland, in particular in the context of Brexit. As a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government is determined to uphold its principles and protect its institutions. We will continue to work to this end with the British Government to support and facilitate the parties in their efforts to reach agreement.	spk_207
#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_10	In reply to Deputy Adams's opening question, I note that the date for the inquest in respect of the ten civilians killed in Ballymurphy is September of next year. I commend everyone who was so committed through their tragedy to seeing that a date would be fixed for the commencement of an inquest. The Dáil adopted an all-party motion in 2015 in support of the Ballymurphy families who continue to seek an effective inquiry into the incident in which those 11 people died. It is one of the 56 legacy inquest cases from the Troubles which are still waiting to proceed in Northern Ireland and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, continues to raise the matter. I hope that in the new situation here and given the fact that we had Fresh Start in Stormont, I genuinely believe that contains the opportunity in its own way to deal with these legacy issues, sensitive and raw though they may be and will be when these things come to light. The timely holding of inquests is an effective part of the right to life as set out in Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights. At least, a commencement date has been fixed and is known, which is an important element. In reply to Deputy Howlin, he knows what the options are. Either there is an election-----	spk_211
#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_10	-----direct rule, or an Executive is formed. I hope the parties will now focus on the fact that they will be sitting down again a day or two after the result of a British general election in which it is estimated the Prime Minister will receive a very much enhanced majority over the one delivered in the last election. For that to happen, the parties have to want it to happen. That means, in particular, that the DUP and Sinn Féin must have a belief that they can put an Executive together. Of course, there are different political opinions and differences of emphasis in a whole range of areas, but that is no reason the parties cannot create an Executive to look at the question of distribution of finances for people to get on about their business. There is the whole issue of Brexit here, as well as those of the agrisector, trade unions and businesses. The people from Northern Ireland who voiced their opinions at the all-island civic forum on two occasions must be represented. They need an Executive to add to the voice of Government here in dealing with the outcome of Brexit when the negotiations start. I hope the two main parties will decide, irrespective of the differences they have, that it is imperative to put an Executive in place. I hope, and I have to believe, that will happen before the end of June.	spk_213
#EndaKenny	2017-05-16	dail	32	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_10	"Deputy Martin raised a very important point about the very good relations, with a few notable exceptions, between Ireland and Downing Street. Those have been very strong in the last number of years. I must note, also, that there is regular engagement at the very highest official level between here and Downing Street on all of these issues. I am sorry the Executive was collapsed and that a replacement was not created. Irrespective of how good or strong it was, it is better to have one than not. The only other options for the Secretary of State are to have more elections or to have direct rule.The Executive is the best option of those. As I said to Deputy Howlin, if the DUP and Sinn Féin do not want to have an Executive then it cannot be formed. They have got to accept their political responsibility. They are elected to an Assembly, the purpose of which under the Good Friday Agreement is to have an Executive to direct affairs for Northern Ireland. As the Deputy knows, this means the North-South Ministerial Council, all of the different councils that can come from it, the issues that will arise because of cross-Border organisations and the administration that entails. Look at Brexit now. We will have to deal with the road to Derry and other cross-Border activities. The Government has opened a European Investment Bank office with a view to having major infrastructural projects which have streams of income to pay off those loans. That will involve, if we want to operate on a cross-Border basis, consultation with somebody. I would prefer to have an Executive of whatever shape or form that at least we could engage with properly and formally. Deputy Martin raises a central issue here. The Executive is gone. It was collapsed and has not been restored. I hope in the two or three days after the British election that Deputy Adams will instruct his leader in the North, Ms O'Neill, and the DUP to get together, as these two parties are in a position to form an Executive in the interests of the peoples of Northern Ireland. The answer to Deputy Burton's question is ""Yes"". We must have opportunities for engagement, as Deputy Martin pointed out, at official level but also at bilateral level. There will be issues that will have to be teased out, as the Deputy well knows from long experience. Ireland will be with the EU 26 in the formal negotiations being conducted by Michelle Barnier. In the course of the discussions there will, of course, be issues that arise that are best understood by the British and Irish because we have been dealing with them for very many years, and we will have to have the opportunity to engage bilaterally. Mr. Barnier will understand this as a complement or as a supplement to the formal negotiations he will lead on behalf of the European Union.

#EndaKenny	2017-05-11	dail	32	Exchange of views with Mr. Michel Barnier, Chief Negotiator of the Taskforce for the Preparation and Conduct of Negotiations with the United Kingdom	dbsect_4	"I am pleased to address the Houses today in the presence of Michel Barnier. Thank you for your fine contribution, Michel. I thank him for his statement in which he outlined the complexities of the Brexit negotiations and for his acknowledgement of their importance for Europe and of course for Ireland. Michel Barnier is a long-standing friend of this country, not just as a leading French politician and Minister, but also as a European Commissioner. Indeed, his time as Commissioner for Regional Policy gave him a particular insight into the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, which will be central to the talks ahead. I also want to thank him sincerely for his willingness to engage with Ireland since his appointment as head of the Commission Brexit task force last July. This is his second visit to Dublin since that appointment but we have also met on other occasions, including on my visits to Brussels in February and March, and at the European Council. Michel and his colleagues in the Brexit task force have been more than co-operative and accessible to our Ministers and senior officials. I know that he has also been open to a range of other important stakeholders from Ireland. I thank him for this engagement. The challenges for this country arising from Brexit are extremely serious; and it is essential that all those affected have the opportunity to make their voices heard. This has also been the approach of the Government here. Along with ongoing sectoral analysis across Departments, we have engaged widely with industry and civic society, holding almost 280 separate meetings. The all-island civic dialogue, which I convened with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, has included 16 sectoral events and two plenary meetings, with more than 1,200 delegates representing industries and organisations from across the country. This kind of consultation has informed our positions on the negotiations, and enabled us to publish our thinking in a comprehensive Government document last week. Events have moved on quickly since Prime Minister May formally notified the European Union of the UK's intention to leave. The European Council agreed the EU negotiating guidelines on 29 April and on 3 May, the European Commission proposed its draft negotiating directives, which build on the guidelines and provide more detail on the issues to be addressed. The extensive preparation by member states, the EU institutions and Mr. Barnier's task force meant that the guidelines were agreed very quickly. This was by no means a given. We know just how complicated and serious the issues are for Europe as a whole and particularly for Ireland. For over two years, the Government has been analysing the issues and engaging with sectors across this island to identify our main areas of concern and to develop our priorities. Some of these have been referred to here by Michel Barnier. These are the protection of the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process, including by avoiding a hard Border; to retain the common travel area; to minimise the impact on our economy and to work for a positive future for the European Union. We have also been extremely active at political and official level in engaging with our EU partners and the EU institutions, with a view to highlighting and explaining the significant implications for Ireland arising from Brexit, and the need to take account of our particular concerns in the negotiations ahead. Indeed, since the UK referendum last June, we have had over 400 engagements on Brexit with our EU partners. In all these meetings, we have explained the background and context of the Northern Ireland peace process and emphasised the need to avoid the re-imposition of a hard Border on the island of Ireland. As I have stated previously, this is a political challenge and we will have to be both flexible and imaginative to deal with it. Thanks to this strategic and patient work, and the understanding and support of our European partners, I am pleased that Ireland's specific concerns - Mr. Barnier has mentioned this specifically - and the unique circumstances that apply here are fully acknowledged in these guidelines. Supporting and protecting the achievements, the benefits and commitments of the peace process, avoiding a hard Border and protecting the common travel area will now be addressed as part of the withdrawal negotiations. The guidelines provide an excellent basis for the negotiations. It was crucial that we got this right from the start and again, I would like to thank Mr. Barnier for his role in making that happen. In more general terms, we are pleased with the tone of the guidelines, which is open and constructive, while nevertheless clearly and firmly outlining the EU's objectives and principles. They highlight the importance of getting clarity in respect of EU citizens' rights, a key issue across member states and important in terms of providing certainty for people and for families. The approach to the sensitive question of the United Kingdom's financial liabilities is also welcome. It is only reasonable that the United Kingdom be asked to honour the commitments it entered into as a member state of the European Union. Mr. Barnier's approach to this is sensible: to focus first on the principles and methodology before considering the numbers or the structure of payments that might be involved. Importantly from our perspective, the guidelines acknowledge the need for transitional arrangements. This will be crucial in order to provide a level of continuity and certainty for our citizens and businesses. As Ireland stands to be more affected than any other member state by the departure of the UK, we believe it is necessary to begin work as soon as possible - and I am glad you referred to this - on scoping out the future EU-UK relationship. I am pleased therefore that the guidelines acknowledge that the shape of the future relationship can be considered once the European Council, that is, the Heads of State and Government of the 27 member states, agrees that ""sufficient progress"" has been made on the withdrawal issues. This phased approach is also a sensible and pragmatic way forward. From Ireland's perspective, our objective is for a close and positive future relationship with the UK, and we are pleased therefore that the guidelines indicate the EU wants an ambitious agreement, not just in economic terms but also in areas such as security. We will continue to work with partners to achieve such an outcome. Consequently, I welcome the European Council guidelines from a substantive perspective and that their principles and approach have been carried forward into the draft negotiating directives. I appreciate the thorough preparatory work carried out by Mr. Barnier and his task force, as well as the European Council team and other EU partners, whose willingness to listen to us, to listen to our story and to acknowledge our unique and special circumstances has brought us to this point. The outcome is an endorsement of the approach by Government and a clear recognition of the specific challenges we face. The Government has robustly defended the Good Friday Agreement process throughout these negotiations so far, making clear that, as a legally binding international treaty, it provides a unique political and constitutional framework on the island of Ireland. We know that it was vital to provide reassurance that Brexit does not in any way undermine any provision of the Good Friday Agreement.In that context, we secured an acknowledgement that, in the event of change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland, brought about in accordance with the principles of the Good Friday Agreement and the principle of consent, the entire territory of such a united Ireland would be part of the EU. I have been consistent in my view that now is not the time to have such a referendum on Irish unity and that the conditions set out in the Good Friday Agreement for the calling of a Border poll do not currently exist. However, the statement agreed by the Heads of State and Government of the 27 EU member states, which will be recorded in the minutes of the European Council, was hugely important in order to dispel any doubt or uncertainty that the UK exit from the EU would negatively impact on this crucial constitutional provision of the Good Friday Agreement. With the EU guidelines now adopted, including the language about our unique concerns, the Government last week published a comprehensive document which reflects the findings of our extensive preparatory work and consultations on the island of Ireland and at EU level, and outlines the positions and priorities that will underpin our engagement in the Brexit process over the next two years. At EU level, the more detailed draft negotiating directives are now being discussed at ministerial and official level with a view to agreement at the General Affairs Council on 22 May. These are again broadly positive from Ireland’s point of view. Mr. Barnier and his team have shown that, in addition to being open to meet with us, they are also listening very closely to what we have to say, which is why I welcome the Ceann Comhairle's decision today. This is vitally important if the negotiations are to proceed in a calm and ordered way, and end up at a point which is as good as possible for all sides. As I said in my statement to the Dáil on Tuesday, it became very clear at an early stage of our analysis that the economic impacts of Brexit would be severe. With the EU guidelines now adopted and work under way on the directives, the Government will intensify its focus on the economic implications of Brexit, including on domestic policy measures to protect it from the potential negative impacts of Brexit, to reinforce the competitiveness of the Irish economy, which is so important, and also to pursue all opportunities that might arise. In this context, I should also mention Ireland will bid, along with other countries, for the two EU bodies currently located in London - the European Medicines Agency and the European Banking Authority. I believe that Ireland offers an excellent opportunity as a location for these. As I have said before, and in conclusion, Brexit is a British policy. It is not an Irish policy and it is not an EU policy. For its part, Ireland remains committed clearly to the European Union and its future. Indeed, a poll published on Europe Day this week showed that 88% of Irish people agree that Ireland should remain a member of the European Union. Participation and membership have transformed our country, as Mr. Barnier is well aware, over the last 40 years. We are committed to playing a strong and active role as a member of the EU 27. We are well prepared and will continue to ensure that our concerns and priorities are reflected in the European Union negotiating position as it evolves, and that we work closely with our EU partners, the EU institutions and Mr. Barnier and his task force, towards a strong and constructive future relationship with the United Kingdom."	spk_4
