Cancer is an awful diagnosis for anyone. Wishing him a speedy recovery.
 Agreed.
 absolutely!!
Get well soon Enda lad.
Best of luck Enda hope you make a speedy recovery.
Im sorry to hear that. Im sure he will make a good recovery. I liked him when he was Taoiseach
I bet he didn’t have to go on any waiting list of his own making.
 There’s a time and a place for everything. Cheap shots at Enda now says more about you than about him.
One of the most decent and honest (there’s a word that some here might find hard to grasp) Taoiseach’s in the history of our country. His takedown of the Vatican is something Bertie (more ash on his head than a fireplace) would never have done.
 Or that time he took a dig at Donald Trump on Paddy’s Day regarding immigrants.
A great Taoiseach who ensured that Ireland was protected from the consequences of Brexit by ensuring that the  EU ptotected the Irish position
History may be kind to him, but I can’t stand him due to the austerity years. He was hiding from the public when we wanted answers to the muck they were pushing through the dail at the time.
 bit like the way they are hiding now
 there’s nobody hiding now… You might not like what’s being presented but there is no hiding
 watch Ur of that rock
 Ur brain is washed with the current s%ite
 his government invited in the vulture funds. Funnily enough, he got a job with one of em after politics, even tho he has no experience in the industry. An obvious reward for gifting them the chance of a home for thousands of people, which will roll into millions over the years. He’s the ultimate snake. Selling out his countrymen for his own sake.
 You’re right, Donnelly and Watt are just lost, not hiding at all!!
An Accidental leader of the country the man  couldn’t put two sentences together,Was coached by the comms people.At least he worked for a while as a teacher compared to Coveney and McEntee who have never actually worked in the real world.Also the likes of inda Mehole and Hannfin and Noonan held on to their Teachers positions for over 30 years,Blocking  young Teachers from a full time job.How many of the above are multi millionaires from being in government compared to if they worked as Teachers?
Brought in property tax (despite telling the people years previously that FF would tax the roof over your head
 Instead FG taxed the ground under your feet.
4/10, but wish I knew nothing of the man or any of his ilk. In reality, he and many like him, are like our own royal family.
Has to be one of the worst taoiseachs we ever had
mehole:Hold my beer
Jesus Christ is this a wind-up??
Great man tough times difficult job
 nonsense. He was useless
The question concerning the names of Kenny,s imagery friends was missing.
He is getting money for doing nothing welfare resiver
Not one question about his favourite soft drink
He is getting money for  doing nothing
 and chicks for free
He brought in the property tax despite telling the people that FF would tax the roof over our heads years prior to that when it suited him to say that and tried to get in water charges only to fail because the people of Ireland stood up to him. Yeah, he will be remembered all right, for being a clown
I know he tried to take my mother’s medical card off her when she didn’t have a job and wasn’t long after getting over cancer. I’ll never forgive him or fine gael for that. I hope they suffer in hell
The less, the better.
He is still a muppet
Probably one of our best taoisigh to be fair, saw us through a very difficult time and won  sailing race with Bear Grylls. What more do you want?
 well it would’ve been cool if he didn’t gift the housing market to vulture funds simply for his own personal gain. He bangs on about “the Irish people” and how great we are, yet he gave away so many critical assets for free. Which has caused irreparable damage and destroyed many many lives. All for a plum job with a vulture fund after politics. He’s no patriot that’s for sure. Greedy, sly and dishonest.
 I second that .
When you write a comment if it does not suit you won’t print it
A  ×#k€r
Paddy wants to know
Didnt take the poll as he was a D.i.c.k that led us before the cabbage , leek and the  worm took over …. I rest my case
His most annoying trait is the way he sniffs between each sentence – Mayo voted all FG TD’s when he was in charge – don’t trust Mayo people!
 it’s the same in most counties. This stoopid “one of our own” attitude. Like they literally don’t care that he went on to hand over all our assets and resources to investors in exchange for a job after politics. He’s from Mayo and that’s all that matters.
I got a C, Enda would probably be ok with that result.
Enough

B 7/10 & sheer guess work
Only2 out of 10Godammit man
Enda Kenny said in 1994 …“It is morally wrong, unjust and unfair to tax family homes.” (Enda Kenny – 1994)BUT refused to vote against the LPT tax on Family Homes in the Dail when he became Taoiseach.Unprincipled … like his class.https://www.change.org/p/abolish-property-tax-on-family-homes
What’s everyone thinking . . .lol
 “I’ll end the scandal of people on trolleys”
 Cha-Ching
 he’s a private citizen, he can join whatever he likes.
 Never liked him, but in he could be doing a lot worse than lobbying for SMEs…. a very far cry for lobbying for vulture funds. I’m gonna give him a pass on this one.
 another day, nothing new here
 He is a sleveen.
Jobs for the boys.
What a Man, all those pensions, Driving Trains, and now the Cherry on top.
Can’t make this stuff up, his teaching job held open for 40 yrs for him ,preventing someone been made permanent.  Does he actually get a teachers pension?
 yes but that’s the public sector for you. He’s had more employment contracts than Zlatan has had football clubs. Teacher, TD, minister, Taoiseach, public speaker, broadcaster, columnist, author, director. He has more pensions than a geriatric barbershop quartet.  At 70 he should be enjoying his riches and moving aside to give somebody else a job.
 greed isn’t something that can be ever satisfied.
I genuinely can’t believe we’re in a situation when I look back at Kenny’s governance of the country with longing…Say what you want about him and his policies but he’s ten times the man and leader of the spineless oik that currently calls himself our Taoiseach.
 ten times zero is still zero.
 haha good one
 a very astute point!
and yet 0 to the power of 0 = 1
 My God. You can count as well
 are you stark raving mad? His govt did nothing beneficial for the Irish people. He is a primary school teacher if he was even that,. Cronyism, nepotism and jobs for who you know personified by him 200% also.
 That a rather nasty, negative comment ! You are entitled to your opinion but FG got rid of Kenny themselves ! Public Opinion would hardly agree with your comments on present Taosaigh!
Perfect role for him after a political career of lies, betrayals an uturns as Gene Kerrigan once wrote about. No morals or ethics and will fit right into PR and Lobbyism. The manwho said ‘Its morally unjust to tax a persons home’ , ‘End the scandal of people on trolleys’, ‘The man with two pints’ and who could forget his infamous ‘Contract with the People’, that he then reneged on. Will he be leaving his other job as advisor and lobbyist for a Vulture Fund ?. How many pensions has he, Teaching pension?  Remember he kept getting double paid for years, Ministerial Pension? Does he get even more ? Why is he allowed multiple pensions while he is still working when ordinary joe soap has to wait till retirement?He is a prime example of all that is wrong with the cosy cartel.
This a disgraceful and a conflict of interest.
 Is he still a TD? I was under the impression he’s didn’t contest the last election.
 no, he isn’t
 there’s no conflict of interest. He’s not a politician, so there’s no issue.
 how is it???
 is he not still a FG member and former Taoiseach? Could easily use his connections to give the firm an advantage (would ya put it past them?). I’d like to know what the author also meant by “the Fine Gael – linked firm”.
 Yes, which is exactly why he’s been hired.I was hired in my current job because of contacts I made in my previous one.That’s how it works.Are you suggesting that people that leave a career in politics can’t go on to work in a private company?
 I have no doubt that Enda Kenny is entirely honest and beyond reproach.However, a career in the private sector during which you build a network of contacts, which makes you more employable and in demand because of your contacts, is completely different to the concerns which exist globally, around the special relationships between lobbyists and serving politicians, the reach and impact of political lobbying in the decision making process, and alleged delayed rewards for serving politicians, from corporate special interests for that alleged political influence.
 in your new job can you use government contacts and lobby certain sectors who your pals are in charge of?
 I don’t think he got the job based on his charm or personality
 that’s for sure
 So nieve, of coarse its a conflict of interest. He’s the previous leader of the country, with many connections in government with his previous party taking the reigns again soon. Any current politician can pass policy, award contracts to a company and then join them when they’re finished politics. Feathering your nest.
 all depends what td stands for.
 No but are you naive enough to think hes not still connected to hes former work mates
 Pretty sure I pointed out that’s exactly why he was hired.The question becomes does all former politicians lose the right to join private firms?Considering pensions were updated to only be paid out at retirement age how can a former politician earn if they’re barred from private enterprise?
 he’s a retired politician, and has no access to classified information. There is no conflict of interest.Anyone who retires from any job has a perfect right to take up any other job.
 any normal person does but he isn’t one is he, he was a leader of this country, same with any politician. If you believe (based on many a political back hand that’s come to light wouldn’t) that a politician wouldn’t be in a position to favour gov. contracts to a company and later move to that company then there’s nothing to see as they’re a private citizen then I’m sorry, I believe that’s being nieve. If Murphy got a position within BAM after once up as hosing minister then you think there’s nothing to see. Pull the other one. Enda has many pensions and a multimillionaire, he’s hired because he has connections in our current Gov. nothing else.
 my point is, Enda is entitled to work once he’s finished in politics but lobbying is using influence on current Gov. and civil decisions. We’re a capitalist society where big business is cozying up to ex.politicians ( people of significant influence) to persuade current Gov. to favour decision to go there way, whether that company is the best choice or not.
Companies unionize to form lobbies to influence poorer working-conditions laws is a very FG thing.While companies are against workers who unionize for better bargaining power for workers.
“the Fine Gael-linked firm”??
Good for him! Best of luck to Enda in his new position
 donk
 Bertie Ahern gutted Kenny got another job on top of his pensions.  Bertie only got a dig out and the horses, and was proven a liar. Perhaps Kenny in his new position could use his influence in discovering the garda commissioners missing laptops and mobile phones and the missing millions in Templemore. Easy to understand why Bertie is pissed off.
This should be illegal. Simple as that.
National Broadband Ireland has been a running joke for far too long.
Mayo might win something now that Kenny has left politics. The Mayo curse has being lifted. This pox box has actually got a real job. They only disappointment is that his state pensions won’t be reduced because political pensions are not means tested. Another loophole every ex politician enjoys.
Jobs for the boys
When Ministers get their pension that should be it they should be barred from all other work. They are retired now on a good pension.
 definitely from lobbying or serving on the boards of companies operating in Ireland.
Of course he does… Slippy, slimy fish that he is….
Though at first it was a spoof story…He had got the job from his imaginary friends. Remember the two pint man he allegedly met in the pub. It is immoral to put a tax on homes. Different politics ? He just kept the status quo for FFG.
 are you against property tax, the most equitable tax of all ?
Ah good aul mumbles Kenny surprised he didn’t go to the comms PR firm considering the son of the owner of the company used to give him speech lessons.
Boom boom
Yeah it’s just their way óf transitioning onto new and better things after politics. Just like our Media Presenters (I wouldn’t call them journalists) move onto better pay as media advisors for the very Parties they are supposed to report on.
A retired former Taoiseach should not be allowed to serve on any lobbying boards in Ireland. There is far too much potential for corruption
 how? He has no access to confidential or classified information.
 Leo has no problem passing on confidential information when incentivized and Kenny would have plenty of info on Gov decisions from former colleagues and the torrent of leaks from FG.
Thank jeebus he didn’t go back to teaching
Imagine this gombeen lobbying on behalf of anything or anyone.
There are no morals, ethics or principles among our political elite. They would sell their mothers for a few Bob. Remember the name Heneghan Strategic Communications and stay clear. Sounds a bit like the beginnings of David Cameroon and Greensil.
Kaching there Edna!
Best man for the job is iron road Enda.
Ah shur twill buy the messages,isn’t that all you’d want.
As they say in cavan “you can fill a hungry man but you can’t fill a greedy man”
For some reason I’m not at all put out by this.
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
How people still tune in to watch this utter S#ite is beyond me, It’s supposed to be an entertaining chat show on a Friday evening when in reality it’s mainly the RTE elite circle of friends guest starring with the odd interesting real life story thrown in to encourage people to watch.Sure to god there are more deserving people in the country who could come on instead of former politicians
 politicians are real life superheroes, if the license fee was doubled, I would pay it to see more of them on tv!
 try harder Tom….;)
Scandals always dissipate through time and politicians know this, remember when Enda Kenny said it was “morally wrong to tax a persons home”. Chancer.
 there was no other way really to dress it up, why tell the truth when a good lie will do.
 so very simple question is why do you watch it? I don’t
 so your the complete AH
 I don’t watch it myself, but nobody is forcing you to watch it are they? Suppose your just more interested in looking for attention on the journal.
 He didn’t say he watched it. He’s stopped watching and commenting on article
 Are you on the bottle lol
We’ll move on as soon as those involved receive consequences for their actions and not a moment sooner.
 How much do u want to beat a dead horse …. move on its over….. open the pubs
 f the pubs. Open the golf clubs.
 open both ?
Just like you moved on from “it’s morally unjust to tax a persons home” and your 5 point failure, you might move on from your failures but we are still paying for them, you are absolute failure.
 was he not blocking a full time teachers position while he was a TD. My guess he gets a teachers pension, TD pension, ministerial pension and Taoiseach pension ! Maybe I’m wrong ?
Reports  say    over€ 4 mill,    a  nice little earner!!!!
 he deferred the teachers pension when he was in Govt but activated it when he retired…..says it all about him
To me Enda Kenny epidermises politics.A TD that took over from his father, became leader of FG when the then Leader Noonan resigned after FG suffered its worst ever general election results, he then only became Taoiseach because the other side, FF, messed up so badly.Success in politics seems to me to be based entirely on the abject failure of those around you, rather than you actually being any good.
 ** epitomises….blasted auto correct…
 I liked the original spelling- I assumed you meant he had skin in the game
 I much more liked your original version! I thought you were being clever about him being a thick skin!!
How much is he earning from taxpayer funded RTE for his new show?
It’s tine to forget about you Mr Kenny
Wouldnt the blueshirts and establishment love to move on from golfgate. Aren’t we great for “moving on” from these things. And the wheel keeps turning with all the fat cats at the trough
 Well, by calling them ‘Blueshirts’ it clearly shows the small distance that you can move.
 I know – these lads posting here saying things like blueshirts just shows the mindset – so backward and embarrassing in 2021
 While the Blueshirts have no problem in bringing up the history of every other political  party , yet they seem forget their own history.  O’Duffy and his Blueshirts sailing under the Swastika to Spain. That name will always stick with them.
 I rest my case
 Why because it’s an embarrassment to them.
If I get fined for breaking the regulations, I’m going to refuse to pay and tell the judge, it’s time to move on now. Get up out of that your honour.
And if anyone in the public sector releases confidential govt information, they shouldn’t face up to 10 years in prison the way Leo isn’t.
One of the key architects of irelands housing crisis.
The gall of that person telling people to move on and let politicians off.He was happy to bend over backwards to protect bond holders at the request the European troika when the people cried out for them to be burned.He represents everything wrong with politics in this country.He has a very evident them and us attitude towards the electorate.
Doesn’t matter who’s on that Late Late Show, it’s unbearable to watch. Sometimes if there’s absolutely nothing else I turn it on but after about 5 minutes I have to turn it off. Most depressing show on tv.
 never watch it Kenny needs to see a barber.
 They are all closed.
Good man Enda, could do with a haircut. Ryan’s hair was looking immaculate, how does he manage it.
And the public Woulfe it down.
He was painful to watch……. seemed very arrogant
 Alan Partridge
 back of the net.
 Which of them? They are both pains in the hole.
 of course he’s  arrogant  he was a TD
 Liquid Politics.
He should enter the Winter Olympics in the Slalom …. he dodged more bullets last night than I care to check.
Listen the day I take advice from enda who knows a man with a pint in each hand or the time we had to pay all our debts back cos the army might have had to be guarding ATM’s Kenny……is the day ill start taking banking advice from Bertie or how to engage in charity work to help the poor from leo….surprised he didn’t do a MM and say it never happened
Plonker
How anyone  could  look at that  thing is beyond  me
Yeah of course Edna. And we need to move on from Beacongate too. We’re such a bunch of ungrateful peasants aren’t we?
Is RTE within 5k of Mayo now??
The state of him on the Late Late. Would remind you of yer man who’s always ‘verra verra drunk’ on the Fast Show.
This story about Micheál Martin just highlights even more how absurd it is that no pictures have yet come out from Golfgate, the only golf event in history with no photos #MicheálMartin #HowIrelandWorks #golfgate
Was there any questions on his role as a advisor to a Vulture Fund, amazing how many ex FG politicians move on to Banking and Finance roles .. I wonder why that is ?
Hes been as quiet as the grave since he stood down, now, all of a sudden, he’s back on TV. Must need some money I guess.
At leas he knows  no one would  vote him into The  Park
Don’t worry Dame Enda the Golden Circle, the vulture fund managers, the bankers etc that busily dipped their ties in the Clifden punchbowl won’t be named, no journalist would have the caqunas to run with a list of attendees at the p*sh up,if they did they would run the risk of government advertising revenue getting squeezed at their relevant media organisation….. the auld nod and the wink…….
Didn’t see it. Did he mention the Moriarty tribunal by any chance.
 I doubt it, sure they moved on from that even before the tribunal and they still deal with Lowry.
Its about vaccinating all of our people so we can get on with the job of ripping them off and screwing them for taxes. He left that bit out didnt he
Typical of both FG / FF they want us all to forget about the last 100 years of favouritism , nepotism & outright political corruption and many of the sheep will agree with him . Rev up and  drive Enda .
Enda served the state well in every capacity he was in. Very proud of him. Set a good example to you aspiring politicians in all parties and none.
 A bit early for the cans don’t you think Tim?
 Jesus Tim you really need to stop sniffing the glue and put it down if you think a lad who said its morally wrong to tax a man’s home, then brought in the property tax, along with spinning some wild fantasy tales about how if we didn’t pay all the bondholders debts back the army would have to be out guarding ATM’s cos we would have gone broke is some kind of great politician….this lad literally fell over a flower pot cos he was so chicken when being asked a few questions by a TV3 reporter a few years ago
 Me thinks he’s popped a few valium with the cans
 plus he said and when I put my name to something, I carry that through”Like white man of rgw wild west… he speak with forked tongue
 He was what. If it wasn’t for Michael Ring surplus in General Elections he was a goner on several occasions. When he was up for questions by the opposition if he didn’t have his ear piece in feeding him what to say you would have seen the Mooran he was and still is.
 Kenny’s legacy….Crumbling Health service, Homelessness, Housing crisis, Vulture companies, Austerity measures to repay for the gangsterism of the banks facilated by FF_Greens who the Blueshirts gladly jumped into government with. Move on ? That’s the mantra of FFG who while bring up the past of other political parties, conveniently forget their own past.
 Did he really say that ?  He signed his name with his infamous “Contract with the People”  and also the 5 point plan and honored neither.  Maybe he meant his Teacher  salary and pension as he carried that through many years as a so called Politician.
 Enda served himself well in every capacity he was in.   There i fixed that for you..
 The Jamaican Woodbines or with a statement like more likely the crack cocaine Tim !
 Dear god. No wonder people keep voting voting them.
His hotline and his overt grading of TDs never materialized. Spoofing sack
So he could travel from Mayo to RTE to talk bullocks with Tubirdy, but I have to stay in my house?
The only thing that makes Enda look good is Leo.
Yes we should move on from golfgateas FG/FF &  the media should also move on from the Bobby Storey funeral,  now we have Taoiseach Micheàl Martin  boxing gate.https://t.co/AEm21iOqHz
Typical lifetime politician completely out of touch with the general public.
Has he or his party ended the scandal of people on trolleys in hospitals as he promised? No? Well why should anyone listen to him as he says a lot but does nothing useful. Pretty much sums up FFGG.
He would say that “Move On from Golfgate” After all he was there ( playing golf ) all be it he left immediately afterwards & Did Not attend the dinner as there was at three Supermacs on his way back to Mayo
Is FG preparing the way for a son or daughter of Enda Kenny?
He’s certainly got some opinion of himself if he thinks he’d just waltz into the role of President. I’d rather vote for Bertie.
How can it be ok for him to travel to Dublin to appear on Late Late non essential travel for a 70 year old and the rest of country told stay home level 5 only applies to some peopleWhy are RTE an exception   are they all vaccinated
He is the spitting image of yer man in line of duty.
 don’t you dare insult poor chief inspector Hastings like that, he actually helps put corrupt people away, enda helps make sure they never get brought to justice and falls over flower pots when reporter’s ask him tough questions
Dude looked like he hadn’t slept in a decade or tubbs found him in a ditch ..
Kenny telling us to move on like when he did with the Garda whistleblowers.Enough now. Better youTell us why you broke lockdown rules to attend a golf jolly . Obviously  he doesn’t know right from wrong either , like the high court judge and tanáiste..Or is it just the rules don’t apply to kenny and his ilk. From his attitude he still seems toHave that opinion.
Chocolate teapots, solar powered torches, waterproof teabags….3 things more useful than Edna Cunny
Looks like he’s sleeping in the park
What’s Enda Kenny doing on T V he’s is now irrelevant he was just boring
No fear of him on his big pension and now a programme and if he traveled from mayo to be there is it necessary he done well  and he made sure the elite were loo kafter
Who would even give this absolute fn over the hill sell the country down the swanny euro lacky kick in the crotch muppet air time …is beyond  me….it would make u stop paying your tv licence
Arrogant hasbeen
Just toddle along there now
Happy to close the Door on the guilty and move on!
They all say that
Get a hair cut Enda,I’m sure Finnola could do!!!!!
Literally every comments section on every article these days is just full of people giving out. It could be the most mundane article but without fail there’s outrage on it. Wtf like!! It never used to be like that.
Are you giving out, about people giving out?
 because when you have clowns like Enda pontificating, that’s why people are angry, in fact I’d say not one politician has one iota of the anger that’s out there.
 the irony of someone complaining about people complaining in the comments section…..oh dear
 Perhaps people can now see through the likes of Kenny who served not the citizens of this State;but served only to protect the status quo of the banks and big business.
Move on about Golfgate but keep bringing up the Storey funeral????
Are there no barbers down in Mayo working on the QT, as poor old Enda badly needs a short back and sides.
 So you are criticising him for following the regulations.
The hair is comical on him
True- time to move on. Flogging the poor horses bones at this stage. Nobody cares. All the bitter pills on here lambasting these guys have probably broken loads of covid restrictions. Hypocrites. and that’s from someone who will never vote FG or FF again, but for different reasons…
  Well maybe FG/FF and the media should practice what they preach and shut up about that Funeral.
 How many; Pensions is he on now.
Who cares,
Seriously, how anyone could have even a passing interest in anything this fella has to say is hard to fathom.
But he is quite happy to talk about GAA gate (or is it more a field)?!?!
This clown could not even run a marathon, and we let him run the country, just when you think it’s safe to forget about him , he raises his head out again.
Because it’s a non-Storey?
I can hardly contain my excitement.
 Ends Kenny not a penny! for water charges to the private vultures what that in Irish enda? pay the nurses and they’ll stay! labour fine geal fianna fail jailjailjail themall. the ratings for that will be in the tank
 gravy trains.? Could be interesting
 old railways, Enda kenny. As gaeilge – doesn’t get much better than that
 The gravy train
They never have enough money do they
Well that’s positive..When I first heard he was coming to the TV screens I thought they were doing a remake of Pinocchio.
 no the shinners have the monoply there.
 I thought they were bringing back Glenroe with kenny playing Miley
 Concidering the recent and past lies and forgetfulness of Phil Hogan think you would want to reconsider your comment. Kenny’s imaginary friends could be seen as lies, but just put down his immaturity.
I can’t wait to not watch this.
Is there no end to the gravy train?…
 somehow I doubt a Irish language show about old railway routes is going to be a big payday! Hardly a gravy train Lol
 You’re right I’d say he’s doing it for free
Ffs it just keeps getting better. Good old forward thinking progressive programming from RTÉ. What’s the Irish for “I’ll end the scandle of the hospital trolley crisis” or show me the money.  Tg4 is there for that.
 your licence fee at work
Leave TG4 alone.Michael D.’s little baby is an excellent service, run on a shoe-string!They keep coming up with marvelous programs from angles nobody else think of.Laugh,I nearly bought a TV licence
Past experience of railroading
 I hope he can hold his train of thought ..
How does RTÉ get is so wrong
Would he ever just take his multiple pensions and f..k off.
Oh sacred heart of Jesus , would be my greatest nightmare to have to listen to/look at him. So I definitely wont !
It’s an interesting subject matter….but my god he’s yesterday’s man personifiedRTE just love this type but do they realise it driver the licence payers mad…maybe it was arranged at the station hotel
I’d rather stick pins in me eyes it’s a noooo from me
Had to check, i thought it was 1st april for a second…
No, no, no.
This is the man that told the people of the west that they didn’t need the western rail corridor opened as he just signed off on 500 million road project (which has turned out to be 1.122 billion so far) and he’s doing a railway show? You couldn’t make this up
There’s a place for this kind of program it’s called Tg4. RTÉ probably produce the most boring home grown shows one could imagine. Needs new leadership and a bit of imagination. The last thing it needs is digging up old retired tds and ex rte pat me on the back aren’t I great person to boost its terrible ratings.
RTE once again stealing ideas from the BBC. Ex politician does documentary on Great  Railway Journeys. I wonder will Kenny wear the same flamboyant threads as Portillo, fluorescent green jacket and cherry red slacks for the Mayo boy.
 but the British are a bunch of trainspotters- we are not. Virtually nobody will watch this
Just goes to show! The propaganda machine look after their own.
That’s my insomnia sorted so.
Micheal (Enda) O’Portillo
Wow, and for that they are asking for license fees…
A program no one wants by a person no one likes. about a subject not many are interested in such a waste of time
This is a terrible idea. The show itself sounds interesting but why are RTE squandering taxpayers’ money by giving a prime opportunity to a has-been. Is there no new person that they could give this to?
It obviously pays to have sailing buddies  in the right position in RTÉ.
Typical reactionary comments. I’m not a FG fan nor an Enda fan but play the ball, not the man please.I’ll watch, sounds interesting. The rest of you can watch your English Premiereship football games on Sky.
 Not about Kenny himself, but it is unacceptable that a public broadcaster should be promoting any former head of government, regardless of the country.
 knob
 I’m sure there are many talented journalists/presenters who can speak fluent Irish. Enda Kenny has enough tax payer money (and RTE is tax payer money since they need to be bailed out every few years).
 I agree with you but he doesn’t need the money. So I don’t think he’s doing it for the money.
 Coming from the likes of you, I’ll take it as a compliment.
 So you don’t think he is doing it for the money? Ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha, cough ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha, choking now ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,ha,
This show will be the exact reason that the next generation will be fluent Irish speakers
Pog mo thoin.
I seem to be the latest trend when politicians finish their jobs on Leinster house the then get a job on TV channels
I hope they do call it Enda the line. I like TG4 historical programing even if I need the subtitles.
Jesus…. RTE really struggling now.
Public service broadcasting for the 13 people in Mayo who’ll watch this.
Is the lad from the comms clinic going write out the script and give him some speaking lessons before the show.
Wonder if he’ll talk about his job as a vulture fund advisor.???
RTÉ could not persuade him to answer to the people when Taoiseach , now they want him to run rings around us again . Has he found his mojo late in the day?
He could become the new voice of “Thomas the Tank” following in the footsteps of Ringo Starr.
 Tommy de tank engine. Howaya from the Island of Achill.
Is he still working as an “advisor” to his American vulture fund buddies given them inside knowledge on what Nama is flogging
The headline alone made me Zzzzzz!!!
Good God the amount of WHINGING in these comments. How the hell do your friends and family cope with your incessant complaining every day. Always something to whine about.
 I wonder was the position advertised?, I’m sure there would be lots of fluent Irish speakers out there with amazing cvs perfect for the job, or was it specifically made for him and tailored to suit?, I don’t like unnecessary whining anymore than the next person but really does he need the few quid or does he need it on his portfolio, I don’t think so!…
 ahh the FFG press office are back …new name though (Simon)
 Pot and kettle!!!!
This sounds fantastic. Fair play to him
Hasn’t the Irish language suffered enough?!?!
Why do I pay a tv licence? It’ll be like Thomas the tank engine for octogenarians.
 you probably watch Sky and other channels that’s why you pay your licence …because that’s what i do.
Seems censorship is alive and well in the journal..Comments removed…It must be Kenny’s imaginary friends.
Don’t forget the late late show is back this week as well
*Yawn*
Was he not head of government when it was suggested that Irish should be removed from the school curricular?
 you need to check your facts there my good man!
 educate me. My good man.
 also, please take note of the question mark!
 Irish Times ANNA NI GHALLACHAIR Thu, Feb 17, 2011Fine Gael’s crude Irish language policy would undo decades of good work
Times like this I’m so proud to have paid my TV license!!
Shrewd and wise, he played the golf last week in Clifden, took one look at the hotel layout and said, lads, I’m out of here. Old dog for the hard road.
Slan forever my Ireland mo Gra this has to be the end of our love for this sad state.
Christ
Another reason to not pay your TV licence.What a load of tripe. Apparently a food stuff as  toxic as my comment, not to mention RTE.
 and for about 2% of the population, what nonesense.Who watches RTE anyway, even in english
Looks interesting I shall watch as it’s part of our history.
Well done 2020…I tip my hat to you…
Should give rosenstock some new material!
What’s the Irish for choo choo?I’m sure the fee for doing the interesting historical piece is modest enough, but if TV4 were to announce that he’s actually donating that fee to a Mayo based charity, all would be well with the world.Enda will probably be doing that anyway, but without the PR.
boom boom.  Great to have him back.  Gift grub and other satirical shows weren’t the same without him.
Go maith
Oof, they tried to slip this one past quietly. Very happy to see FF, Labour and Greens didn’t shy away from challenging this. As the article says, dangerous to start “deleting” reports like this from the Dail library.
Why would he want it removed? The report happened and a subsequent report corrected the record. Seems like an odd request. I agree with Howlin re the egg analogy. The history records are clear on the following events so his name is clear unless there is more to this??
 there’s always more to every Irish story but a veil of vanity and a knob of narcissism might be in and amongst
I dunno alot about this but deleting stuff from the records sounds well dodgy…
 it would be, but once the Supreme Court declared it invalid, in its conclusion, it shouldn’t be there .
Suspicious to me that they would opt to delete the report rather than amend it, or add footnotes.
 this being the case should all cases that were deemed invalid over the course of history never to be able to referred to again? Well dodgy
 in what way would one refer to an invalid report? Unless of course to suggest that just because a report exists doesn’t mean its right
Surely Shatter is content with having his name cleared and reputation restored by the highest court in the land ?It seems churlish for a former Deputy and his party to be trying to remove reports commissioned by Parliament from the Dail library. What point is being made here ?People are free to make their own minds up whether the report is removed or not. We are in the midst of a Pandemic so a bit of cop on is welcome
Less, unlaying eggs. More like a dog with a bone. Right or wrong, these events are an important part of history.
FG – the “don’t recall” missing minutes/reports party. Now just deleting unsavory embarrassments without due democratic process.  Class act.
The report is just the physical record of the allegations and the resultant investigation and findings, surely there could be a further report included to show the appeal against the report and the decision of the higher court, there needs to be a record in the public interest and to make sense of events particularly when time passes and students of politics look to see the chain of events otherwise this will make no sense.
Put in on the shelf with the Moriorty report
“Moriarty”
History books are written by the winners.
Stinks
I’m very found of McCabe. I think Shatter is a very talented , I reckon he was in disbelief when the truth did get dragged out, I think parts of the country have cleaned up the force greatly but I am sure there is some pockets of misconduct. Shatter was fed to the wolves.
CNTRL + C . CNTRL + V.
SF will be sidelined. Pretending they got a landslide with their 14 extra seats. ,All guff, grandstanding and playacting.They don’t have the numbers. With surplus economy, 3.5% annual growth  and full employment they wont be allowed to wreck it.Its FF plus Dems, Green and sensible independents in minority Govt with support (conditional ) of FG and maybe Labour.SF sidelined and mad lefties sidelined. Thank God.
 You don’t believe in democracy. The party that got most votes was SF.It’s undemocratic of the cartel of FFG to sideline the most voted party.FFG will have their last go should they join again. Not what the people voted .Times a rocky ahead…
 mad lefties lol. You do know that the soc dems consider themselves as a party of the left.  FF won’t solve the housing crisis, homeless crisis and childcare crisis. It will be the same old except their brown envelopes will be now fully recyclable.
 Unfortunately another rainbow minority government is not what the country needs. What it needs now, is a stable coalition of like minded, sensible parties.Failing that, another election.
 The Social Democrats, and Labour are not parties of the left. They are parties of the centre.
 but you continually use the term cartel and FFG. If that’s what they are, then using your logic, they got the most votes, the most seats and won the election?
 The election of a Taoiseach is about votes. What do you not understand about that. SF don’t command anywhere near a majority. Clinton got more votes but Trump got in. Same worldwide.Its about respecting the fact that the vote of every Deputy is equal. Now that really is democracy like it or lump it.
 centre left
 More guff. Soc Dems are left of centre. All the “chicken in every pot” crew are so far left they are meeting themselves coming back. Trotskyists, Marxists, Maoists and whatever you are having. All support Maduro, love Cuba and thankfully have no clout.
 Agreed but the people did not vote that way and you play the hand dealt to you .
 it would only be undemocratic if Sinn Fein got 51% of the vote and weren’t the party in power.They may have the most votes at 25% or whatever it was but that means 75% didn’t vote for them.If FF and FG form a coalition, their share of the vote is 45% or whatever it is and that’s much more than Sinn Fein’s 25.45% of people voted for parties knowing they wouldn’t go into government with Sinn Fein and thats what they wanted. And I think FFs and FGs commitment to their promise must be respected much like people shouldn’t criticise SF for not taking their seats in Westminster, people knew what they voted for.You can say a lot of negative things about the Irish system but you can’t say undemocratic.
 You keep going on about the first preference votes 500,000. If only the number one vote counted and all seats were filled by a first past the post after count one. The lay of the land would be FF 48, SF 39, FG 33, IND 17 and GP 9. Check it out for yourself, I’m purely a numbers guy and have no skin in the game.
 it’s not the Number of votes that count as democratic but the number of actual seats in the Dàil
 but that is where you are wrong. They are going in the direction of getting clout. FFGs numbers are going down. From 69 per cent in 2007 to 43 per cent in 2020. SF will be in government in the republic. It’s just a matter of time. If FF and FG go into  grand coalition it will be an earthquake in Irish policies and the beginning of their end as separate entities.
 The Spring tide ended in a surge for labour and the same level of support and seats That didn’t end happily. It is not impossible for SF to be in Government at some stage but a lot of their TD’s need to grow up and stop taunting people.
SF will never command a majority because Ireland is predominently middle class.
 Here we go in black and white, it’s about “class” you believe that middle class people only choose to put their vote to FFG. They chose differently because… you fill in the blanks. FFG middle class, morally bankrupt.
Enda Kenny is my most disliked Taoiseach. An absolute chancer who only got there because he was leader at the right time. If Fine Gael had someone half decent they would have won a majority in 2011.
 it’s got to be Brian Cowan or Bertie for me. They inflated the bubble till the end and we’ve suffered ever since.
 I’d agree that Kenny wasn’t especially likeable. His two saving graces for me were his state apology for the Magdalene laundries, and his speech in front of Trump about immigration. I wondered where this version of him had been all along.
 yes state apology but still denying them proper compensation. Talk is cheap for these politicians.
 From what I’ve read there are indeed issues about records of time in the various laundries, which is ridiculous. However over 700 women have received compensation totalling 25 million. No money can replace or truly make up for what they lost and were denied in life. Its start, that needs a satisfactory conclusion sooner rather than later.
 Agreed, I couldn’t stand how he was so blind to peoples rage over Irish Water, and hide from the press for weeks at a time. He also had a bad case of assuming things would go his way, such as Brexit and the U.S elections. I won’t forget when he said Britain would definitely make ‘the right decision’ and that ‘we had no plan B’ because he was so confident in the remain side. Such arrogance was a feature of that Dail, with Moan Burton and AK47 around.
 you are forgetting the minister for austerity who rode into the sunset with a job in the EU.
 its Varadkar for me iv seen a lot of smug arrogant Leaders but he’s the worst
 Ireland arranged for brexit before the vote took place by a special group to research the impact and key issues for future negotiations.We had a plan B and immediately started negotiations for it (the backstop).
All about the money. If they weren’t paid , it would happen very quick…
Good work Sean, great read.
That smug multi pensioneer, with his contract
That glorious time in between government formation, when it seemed no bad decisions were being made for once. Then FFG happened. I don’t get why they are following the same charade as last time, FF and FG are the same, so drop the pretense. Hate this pantomime that shows clowns could appear with more leadership skills than this constant squabbling.
That doesn’t mean that he’s not the worst Taoiseach ever . I know that there is stiff competition for that title. But Leo is a serious contender?
 he is the worst easily and that’s saying something
 short memories here
 really? Worse than Charles Haughey or Brian Cowan? You really need to look at past performances.
 not only the worst and most uncaring but he is pure evil ,like the rest of his party
 not only the worst and most uncaring but he es pure evil ,like the rest of his party
 hes vying with kenny to be our worst leader, imagine that.. how bad is his performance that hes very very near the top of the list despite all his spending on make up spin and socks! No fan of any of the others btw
 back to the stone age please!
 pure evil? Some drama queen you are!
 ‘Pure Evil’?!  Ah here… you certainly haven’t lived under Haughey with the tax increases and high unemployment as he was living it up!  Or Cowan as he brought the country to its knees and sold us down the river to the Troika?  Or Teflon Bertie – giving it with one hand and taking it all (and more) with the other and hiding behind a shower of liars.
Crime out of control  , Poor Border Protection , No dedicated intelligence service , Armed Forces in tatters due to poor pay and poor terms and conditions . White Collar crime rampant.  Inconsistent sentencing for serious crimes . Lack of investment in education system and still mostly under the e his of Catholic Church , Our universities are slipping in the global ranking . Our HSE is a basket case , No investment in mental health , Massive housing crisis , lack of investment in water , public transport etcWe are  going backwards not forwards
 Deep breaths… breathe slowly in… then out again. Granted the choice of running “Leo Varadkar’s third Christmas as Taoiseach means he’s no longer the shortest-serving office holder” probably wasn’t the brightest idea to celebrate first thing on Christmas morning for a media org. Not exactly a milestone to celebrate for some of the reasons you outlined.But really, “Poor Border Protection , No dedicated intelligence service , Armed Forces in tatters due to poor pay and poor terms and conditions.”?? Are we expecting an invasion by Mexico or perhaps the English again?Enjoy your day and try not to bore anyone at the Christmas table.
 Couldn’t agree more with that comment. The country is in tatters unless you seeing it from the ivory tower.
 dude you need to fix your rose tinted windows.
 Spot on. The man isn’t my cup of tea, however when you compare him to his predecessors, he’s not so bad. I mean to the best of my knowledge, he’s not corrupt. He shoots from the hip, which occasionally gets him into bother, but all in all, we could do much worse. Bertie and Enda just has to be the most uneducated and embarrassing leaders of all time.
 we do have a dedicated intelligence service.  The fact you are not aware of them means they are doing a good job
 we actually don’t have a dedicated intelligence service .
He was was not elected by the people. He’s only Taoiseach because of his party.
 no Taoiseach is elected by the people, that’s the president. The Dail elects the Taoiseach
 Yeah, pretty much been that way with every Taoiseach since the foundation of the State, history books are cool for knowing about how your country operates.
That’s the way in this country. The Taoiseach  is elected by the Dail
 how were all the other leaders elected oh wise one?
I like him, he is a leader who you can be proud of when he goes abroad, he is not bigoted like so many leaders nowadays. He is not corrupt like so many of our past politicians either.  Everything is not perfect in Ireland but we have full employment and we are starting to deal with that 200 billion debt that the fianna fail government left us with. I am amazed with the amount of negative moaners on the comments section of the journal.  Cheer up its Christmas
 I am sure all the homeless parents and kids in hotel rooms this morning will be jumping up and down with joy with you Wesley.Enjoy your day.
 totally agree.A proper leader ,intelligent and articulate,  thoughtful person.Country is doing well with very little unemployment. Homelessness an issue but it is the case in most countries and cities.Rampant in UK. Homelessness or in temporary accommodation or rented accommodation unfortunately is part of modern day life, and will  never be solved for numerous reasons.
 oh dear, what a clown you are.
 Well said Wesley and John below, on principle I could never vote for Fine Gael, and I never have. Enda Kenny’s government treated people with appalling disdain, and they have far too many arrogant and out of touch TD’s and Senators. That said, Leo and Simon Coveney have done a superb job representing our country throughout Brexit and various trade deals. A lot of legacy issues inherited that have become worse though such as health and housing, so a black mark on those portfolios among others. A lot of people feign concern about homelessness, but it’s so transparently just a cover for their prejudices against Varadkar’s personal traits, not to mention a lazy response to every article about Varadkar, “homelessness, muh!”.
 any drugs left?
 go away you blinded lick arse he’s an narcissistic nasty individual who looks down his nose at the vulnerable in our society like all well heeled Blueshirts
And a nice fat pension to collect that he doesn’t deserve.Hey Leo let us know what you had to contribute to get extra ordinary pension benefits
 there is always some biring idiot on about pensions!
It’ll be his last Christmas as Taoiseach too. A wretched bunch
 very unlikely that it will be his last Xmas and if so we get Martin .
Still a w*nker though..
I think Leo has done well, our economy is flying despite Brexit. 10,000 UK people are coming across each year to a better, more egalitarian country. He’s made many mistakes, yet at least admits them. Like Ends before him, Leo is a credit to us on the international stage. I say all of this as a Fianna Failer!
  Any comments on all the social issues we have in the country John or should we give you time to remove your blinkers?
 Jesus you’re some joke probably speaking out of your large wallet
The worst government ever by far
 How could it be worse than Berty Ahearne’s government that bankrupted the economy
I don’t understand all the hate he gets. He’s a very respectable taoiseach when compared to pretty much every taoiseach we’ve ever had. Wish he’d do more to fix homelessness and housing though.
  It’s not hatred Gerald. Leo is no leader. His style of management is very childish based on his smart alec responses in the Dail when he is challenged. He is not very assertive either. In all honesty, he would be lucky to have a low level managers position in any private company.
 read your entire comment out loud to yourself again and realize how ridiculous it is
 Think its just the journal but Im not seeing anything so negative against him anywhere.And when asked here no one here puts up any alternative suggestions for the post.
 he’s a bloody fraud he’s detests his ego not being massaged
Let’s hope it’s his last one enough is enough time is up sockboy
Not my taoisach
No need for that language on Christmas morning.
New year will rectify that situation
There is an opening for 2nd place though
 standard practice for all anonymous whinging trolls
Oh give it a break Enda. Full of hot air as usual.
 Maybe you should actually check out what the task force has achieved since it was set up rather than share your ignorance with everyone.
 Let this plan have a chance! Don’t knock it unless you have something better to put in it’s place!
I see the taxpayer stopped paying for his make up anyway..
Coming from the person of questionable parentage that created the problem in the first place along with his buddies I think that’s rich !!
The bold Enda ‘I will end the scandal of patients on trollies’ KennyStraight after he got FG into power, he then downgraded Roscommon hospital and closed down 90% of the wardsYou are a liar and a conman Kenny, would you ever just FO
 Why don’t you run yourself @@at, you made your point and, things aren’t as you would want, run for election. We need good people!
 if I were in a position that I could devote ALL my time to helping other people, politics would be the last thing I would get involved in.Political is not about helping others, it is about lining your pockets
 That’s my point. You could start the revolution to change things and make it more decent! Or do you think that there is no way to improve? That would be extremely sad?
 you should read up about George Lee’s attempts to effect change and how he was thwarted at every turn. He has to walk away from politics
 roscommon hospital is running at full strength this week. Definitely not at 10%. Just sayin.
They need to start with o’connell st, It used to be so much nicer, No it’s just an eyesore, unused grey slab.

EndaWhen you are on your rare visit to tje big schmoke.call to Jim Gavin and see how much he wants to manage MayoMichael ring has a bit left in the rural develop ent budget
The likes of kenny, Pascal, Noonan and the majority of fg have absolutely no shame, they’ve knowingly destroyed men women and children’s lives through their actions, embarrassed and ashamed i ever voted for them.
Then ask your cronies to stop selling it out and promote local communities to come together rather than divide them. Simple enough.
Apart from the mandatory, everyone else is at fault, ffg, vulture fund, homeless, it would be good to add ideas that have worked well in other countries. A simple one is to stop NIC being used as a rat run, and remove most through road. This would reduce speeding, allow kids to play, and enable teens be part of wider communities instead of being trapped in slums. Secondly, reintroduce community services such as waste disposal, creches and community childcare schemes. Finally, create mandatory community employment for long term unemployed when out of work, and finally retire justice Nolan to ensure that crime doesn’t pay.
 they have waste disposal.
Dublin always had pride
 Great to hear that Margaret.
And this is the same Enda Kenny who gave our cultured fiends their own ethnic minority
 Agreed, In my book, we were all born equal. Why do we need to create division by the establishment of one group or another?
I’ve more confidence of having a solid bowel movement after a feed of bad stout and out of date beans than anything that comes out of that clowns mouth!!!
Large scale social housing projects in the inner city are just not working. When times are tough people resort the crime and drugs are rampant. And times have been tough.
 there were significantly more social housing units in the city in the past and significantly less crime.
Enda stealing Leo’s thunder
Easy know there is an election coming when fg drag him out to face media thought he retired…
 One way to lose an election. I’d be keeping him out of the spotlight.
Resurgence?? Back to good old Charlie Haughey,, @DarraghOBrienTD

I was having a very pleasant Friday morning til you reminded me if that Boll!x
 Bit early for a can I suppose. :-(

pity Bear didn’t eat him…
 no such thing as too early  for a can
We seem to love hearing about our ex politicians and their extravagant lifestyle courtesy of the tax payer, great little country we live in.
 curtesy of the tax payer???
 couldn’t give a shyte about what the MayoMoron gets up to.. another useless lump with an obscene pension
Certainly beats sitting around at home watching Countdown.
  Him and Noonan are still TD’s. We’re paying their salaries and their numerous pensions. I wonder when did either of them last attend Dail Eireann? Not that their attendance would make any difference whatsoever.
 so, he’s not allowed to take a couple of days to enjoy during the Dáil summer recess?Got it.
 A couple of days break away from doing what exactly?
 they’re on holidays at the minute, in fairness.
 I thought Noonan was put out to grass by now
 Noonan and Kenny ………………….Traitors to the core
 he’s only attended once since he left office
 They don’t get pensions as they are still TDs. They changed the rules in 2011. No-one who left office since then gets a pension until they are retired and over the retirement age. That is why lots of FF TDs quit in 2011 – to get pensions under the old rules. And yes they still attend the Dáil.
fair play…
Also crewed a FG government that screwed and continue to screw the nation…
 Christ
 take a break Willy
 And a happy Friday to you too, Willy.
 well said willy,ignore fg Twitter bots
Isn’t it great the lifestyle you can lead with multiple pensions. In the meanwhile Food banks were never seen in the country until Enda Kenny came to power. Wednesday evening over 400 people queued for a food handout outside the Bank Of Ireland in Dublin. That sight never occurred either until Enda Kenny came to power.
 The various  Penny Dinners charities have been operating since the foundation of the state. The church and the VDP have been giving food handouts to the poor for even longer. Do you know anything about Ireland Dave?Is this some stuff you read on Facebook? Or were you there? Who were these 400 people? have you any actual evidence this occurred? Or are you just making stuff up again?
 Photographs all over social media showing it. You’re just one more FG shill wanting to deny the reality of how FG policies affect the people of the country.
 Social media is not reality.
 It is when FG are trying to control it’s content.
My Neighbours cat had kittens .
It’s easy to forget since hes done nothing for years but he’s still an active TD along with Noonan.
Enda Kenny…not a Penny!!!
Was it just the two of them sailing the vessel or an active part of the crew, or was he a passenger?
 Part of the cabaret entertainment I would have thought
Glad he’s enjoying his retirement some serious begrudgers out there. He worked hard for his country and served it as best he could. Granted that best was pretty woeful
Well done Enda, dont mind the begrudgers and naysayers. The economy has well and truly recovered under your inspired leadership.
 thanks for the flattery of presuming I’m the ex taoiseach. The economy has recovered…
 But he has not retired
Surprised it didnt sink like the way he sunk this country
the p**c* really enjoying his retirement when most pensions are struggling to pay a tax on their home which he is responsible for
The 2020 Queen’s List, Sir Enda Kenny, KBE, celebrated environmental campaigner…
And? Why is this important? Or even news There are a lot more items that are more newsworthy or are u that lazy
 Clickbait. How long are you reading the journal.ie now?

 Well he boiled ours for long enough but not sure if he drinks it!
 F.F done that
 That old nugget doesn’t work anymore, F.G have been in government for 8 years
 he’s been taking the piss your years
So what
Enda Kenny..Bear Grylls ..in the same sentence..FFS !
He wasn’t playing about on the taxpayer he was doing his bit for Charity and at the same time enjoying himself good luck to him just shows the human in him.
Enda operated the spin-naker sail

May he have a good retirement, he deserves it.
Kids are grown up and the wife is probably sick of him looking up her hole for weeks on end so she was probably glad for him to spend some time racing the dinghy with all the posh folk.
Feck enda clown  & dislike enda for years
Well!! Pmsl!!! At least the Journal has a more accurate headline than the Irish Times or the Indo who proclaim he won  the racw with an afterthought of others being there too! He couldnt win a Fianna Fail raffle in a country parish!!
Kenny and FG; Tories through and through
Boom! Boom!
One is a man used to surviving in deadly hostile environments where everything you see is out to kill you- the other is Bear Grylls.
Whatever floats your boat.

Just wondering how floating about on expensive yachts with British titled personalities helps African wild life, & how is the bubbly & prawn titbits paid for?Is their a corporate sponsorship to this charitable exercise?Although tigers are not African, Enda, Bertie, & their teams fairly done for the extinct Irish tiger economy, so perhaps the association is a bit unfortunate in this context.He doesn’t look like much of a sailor anyway, a bit sea sick by all appearances.
Rumour B..B..B.. Bertie taking over from Galvin to start the DubsDicks for Six .
What a gimp. Hate him
Bear sold outBecame a media slutAnd his career has boomed
Well, at least he’s not on RTÉ radio talk shows every third week, dishing out advice.Seems to have kept his head down. Am no blue shirt, but, I DON’T think he’s been the worst.
A pity it didn’t sink and take the slimy B….. D with it…
The salaries are unjustified
How dare people have jobs.
 you a an idiot if u think that’s why people are mad
Why does Michael D Higgins need an adviser?
 you can’t just saunter of to the canaries alone, can you?
Why do we have the cost of politicians AND the cost of advisors. Surely the advisors can be appointed to the job with predefined job targets and we get rid of the politicians OR we only allow qualified people appear on the ballot papers for the jobs they want to be appointed/elected into. Is this to simplistic an idea to save the country millions – #handynumber #loadofballicks
 if the party put the candidate up for election based on nepotism, family traditions and the electorate vote them in because they like a familiar name or party loyalty and the td is a cute hoor likeable sort who touches political skin well then essentially you have a minister who is out if their depth and need a team of advisors. Others advise on strategy to put opposition down rather than public interest. Others are for pure spin to sell an idea to electorate.  Others have jobs to keep secrets secret and advise how key appointments of friends can sort. Others deal with big business and the EU needs us to tow the line so you need advisors to haggle there for your own or country’s interest. The basis that the electorate is passive and easily fooled helps.
 is that not what public servants are supposed to do? All departments have a team of highly paid professionals who have been employed to be the link between the department and the admin/public. Paid advisors outside of those provided with a public position should not be discretionary – party for then privately all they want, but not out of public funds.
 yes and there are good public servants who have the country’s interests at heart regardless of government. I was just addressing Richards question. But the growth of advisors, masters of spin and self interest is a trend that has grown exponentially since the days of PJ and Charlie. We are copying the American and British model. Personality politics with no substance and a view that the little people are easily codded. Since we are a small country it really is a piece of cake to carry this out and keep going.
 Well the last GP that was minister for health did a great job…….. Not.
Sickining the way money is spread like confetti at government levels

 to be fair the SRE role in Google was unexpected. Only one in the list with a job not depending on contacts – not that you could add “being politicians sound board during alleged kidnapping” on to your CV.
It’s like a disease being able to change itself from one disease into a parasite???
No point in seeing what our ex politicians are doing. They’re all lobbyists (unfit for anything else).
Honestly, of the ones that moved on, they wouldn’t inspire you. One fella moved onto vice pres of the EU bank, thats good, but the rest, a mixture of pr jobs, lobbying jobs, an engineer at google, local radio, startups ….
There are plenty multinationals in ireland, you’d think there should be opportunities for some of them there, at a global level, if they were good enough, but no.
 excellent point
Tax Joe Soap to his knees for these …Disgusting behavior…We need change..
Hey Journal. Where’s the article on ministers assistants being overpaid that you put up at 12:10 last nite??? Hiding it at 12:10am was sus enough but now tis gone altogether???
 apologies. Back and with original comments. Xoxo
How’s biffo’s situation?  Nothing trivial I hope.
 Heard nothing and they didn’t move him to a real hospital so he can’t be too bad.
Dear God …
It’s all about money for the blue shirts. Tax breaks for the crony’s in big business. Indja the ninja is a veteran back slapper and a great friend to the corporates. No better buachaill for the insider info.
 you took the feckin words right out of me mouth Willy
 that pat on the head was worth it Edna!
The corporate thank you to kenny for being so loyal while in office
On top of a gold plated pension…Not bad for a teacher that only worked for a few years in his life.
 they all have pensions, even Jarry Adams has multiple pension and houses
 and that interests me why exactly!!.The article is about Kenny and that is who I am commenting on.Hold off for a while, I’m  sure there will be an article about others with gold plated pensions getting  prestigious positions.
 just letting you know every politician across all divides get pensions
 not bad for a totally brainless moron of a gombeen….it pays to be full of shit in Ireland obviously..
 He plays the “gombeen ” but is one smart man .He has avoided work all his life and look where he is now.We are the gombeens here by voting for the likes of him and supporting him with our taxes.
 I am sure its a real easy job being Taoiseach. Just dossing around all day in your vest and underpants watching Jeremy Kyle.
 there is a lot of people out there avoiding work all there life getting free houses and medical care etc
 What did he ever achieve?
 What does any politician achieve?
 Apart from tormenting 4.8 million people, I guess nothing much.
Guess it pays to fxxk u your country over.
He “led Ireland through the global financial crisis”? Really? What exactly did he do to achieve that monumental goal?
 He used his government’s big majority to reform the health service, reform the legal profession, reform the Seanad, give report cards for his ministers, have a contract with the people….. actually wait a minute, that was only in his head….and on his manifesto
Undoubtedly linked to Vulture Funds. Thanks for slicing up the carcass of your country for us to feast on Enda, now here’s your reward for being a good boy.
Kenny, go back into the woods and duct tape yourself to a tree like a good lad.
The whole world is one big bluff
Political retirement; the time of life when a career full of Quid pro quo’s are repaid.
 he’s still a sitting TD
I wonder will all the FFG journal lovers respond to this article or are they all gone into hiding.
The bigger the thicker you are in politics the bigger reward you get in Ireland it seems. Wonder what happened to the extra gardai on the streets that he promised in his election lies? Hospital trolleys didn’t work out either, did he tear up the contract he signed with us?Should have stayed in teaching, would have done less damage to us all.
 I agree, Jarry Adams wrote a cook book
 You are clearly in awe of Mr Adams.
 Joirry not given a job for the boys, he had to do something
Just a shame he wasn’t part of the diaspora!
The gravy train never stops and those with their snouts in the trough are always at it
 too right,Mary Harney made chancellor of u l,the gravy train rolls on  for the select few in the know
 wouldnt be much gravy left after mary had been on the train id bet !
Unfortunately that’s the way the game works in all European countries and the US..while in office look after corporate and financial interests to the detriment of wider society and when you leave office your palm will be greased..appointments to boards and the lucrative speaking fees are the legal bribery in the supposed democratic world
So the man who sold the country off to vulture funds has signed up to help the same vulture funds continue to work with FG to destroy the country. #VultureWave
Sweet Jesus… After F.F. brought this country to it’s knees, Kenny and his crew made it worse , can only imagine the advice he will contribute.
A) Enda Kenny has not retired. He is a TD for Mayo. He is being paid to do a job he is not doing.B) “equity” firm means vulture fund. Funds that Enda and Noonan welcomed with open arms.This man is shameless and is being rewarded for putting Irish people through years of austerity.
Ah sure god help enda he needs a top up !
The pure greed of Irelands  puppet politicians has no boundaries !
Hmmm i guess he will resign his dail seat now …he is still a sitting TD…
Can’t see him bringing much to that role. Its the same for all our gombeen FFG politicians, shows how unqualified and incompetent they all really are. Cowan hasn’t established any new career since his debacle, other than making the tea for dob.
 part time Guinness test pilot too is our Brian Clown
…on the plus side, though, I never really knew what he did when he was in office. So that lovely little bio has set me straight.
One day these guys woul have to be stopped.
 His close friendship with the maltese tax exile and siteserve is enough proof for a lot of people, including me.
Jobs for the boys curruption all the way they are laughing at us we are like sheep
There should be no surprise here…… for anyone! Kenny was always seen to be feathering his own nest, just like the corrupt, immoral party he comes from! Varadkar & Co. are equally treating this country as their own cash cow, positioning themselves for top pensions, cushy jobs and taking responsibility for their blatant failings! It’s time voters put the good of this country first and voted these elitist parasites out of government…. then we will see this country flourish for all, not the few!
 wonder was 1916 worth it after all?  No leaders in Ireland just corrupt overpaid slugs
 Have any of them criminal conviction for membership of terrorist organisations?
 not sure ‘anonymous’, you should research that, I’m sure you can manage that, and while you’re at it, staying on topic!
 I thought you might know, I believe you have done a lot of research on members of the Dáil down the years.
 okay then, you can’t stay on topic…… another anonymous, cowardly, government defending troll!
This man is not competent to be in charge of a wheelbarrow.
The only advice he is qualified to give is on how to live a life of nepotism
Wow, another shining example of the corruption and shameful nest feathering of the FF/FG cartels.
There’s no hitch on the coffin!
Right there you have it
OMFG
Money follows money but I can’t understand why anyone would employ that idiot
Great to see Enda Kenny back in focus.  He is honourable, principled, knowledgeable and experienced for such a position. He served our country well over a difficult period of economic instability.
 Hi Enda
Why did no Irish media outlet investigate this, it’s a huge issue
 Because any journalist who tries to hold power to account in this state in any meaningful way gets blackballed e.g. Gemma O’Doherty after she broke the story on Martin Callinan.Instead we get spoonfed stories about leos socks.
 I’d imagine because Ireland’s version of Donald Trump forbid it.
 You mean the Irish Katie Hopkins?Really clutching at straws.
 Friends of friends unlike FB lol.
Cue the list (also known as friends of kenny), who will make statements saying they were never lobbied by their “friend” kenny, and thats supposed to make it OK then!
I also think sandberg was playing them, being intentionally extra nice to them when they were supposed to be stern to facebook about their business.
I’ve long said Kenny and the rest of the parasites are rotten to the core, I truly hope someday the truth comes out about what many politicians have done,not to be trusted whatsoever under any circumstances.
It wouldn’t be a scandal by Irish standards.FG/FF would sell their Granny’s for a touch of US investment. No problem going to court with the EU on behalf of Apple and the annual tradition of cow towing to the US President in the White House every Paddys day. The 51st state and all of that.Winky winky backy slappy.Proudly promoting cronyism since 1926 with a hearty laugh.
Of course they would, wouldn’t they? It is not as if there would be a paper trail to uncover what went on.
As if they were going to say yes he lobbied us….   FFG Out…
Checked the Indo and other online “newspapers” this morning, not a dickiebird about this scandal. Rest assured were it someone remotely connected with SF it would be headline news for a week.
Don’t know what’s all the gasp shock horror for this is the man that sold the country to the lowest bidder ..fn parasite.. .journalism in Ireland haha give me a break…
 who did he sell us to … I think we still own Ireland last time I looked it up…
 him and his mate noonan goldman sacs …vulture funds ….did nod off for a decade or 2 ..in a few years you won’t be able to buy a house .have another snooze check back when your proper rested
 The way FG have things running, soon enough, there won’t be a brick, a block, or a blade of grass owned by a native Irish person in the country.
Sniffs the air cos there’s an awful smell of BS all of a sudden
 Of course there is. It’s always in plentiful supply here at The Journal.
Once again we have to turn to the UK newspapers to tell us whats happening in this rotten little state. Shameful.
 no we don’t… it’s a .uk spin pile of shite … rubbish journalism
 ‘A UK pile of shyte” based on court papers? The only shyte is what’s coming from FG supporters
The ODPC enforces laws. I thought the alleged lobbying was at the law-making level?
I’m not a fan of Enda Kenny or a supporter, but remember, this report just happens to come out now, from a pro Brexit anti Irish source. I’ll wait and see how it develops before I condemn Kenny on this issue. There has never been anything in his career to indicate he’s corrupt so even if he did do he most likely was thinking of jobs for the country, like he’s supposed to do.. If it happened, it’s a misjudgenent on his part, but in the interest of fairness let’s wait and see.
 The Observer is a left-wing  decidedly anti-Brexit newspaper with a high reputation  for accuracy.Incidentally, it is also generally sympathetic  towards Ireland.
 Report actually comes out of Court documents in California, It`s not made up by an pro Brexit and anti Irish source though.Unless you are privy to info the rest of us aren`t.
 James just got schooled…
Of course not blueshirts
If it quacks like a duck,and walks like a duck, ITS  A DUCK.
Of course not blueshirts  never would they seek to influence
Well in fairness he did say ‘categorically’ so he must be telling the truth.
It would be very hard to ask him anytime now he never in work if I don’t go to work I don’t get paid
He was always alittle weasel cosying up to the Yanks and acting like Darby O Gill in the White House on Paddy’s Day.
“If he were innocent…”Fair play Jonathan.Get the slander in immediately.
Yet again it’s took an overseas newspaper to uncover and print questionable items that RTE and Irish media won’t inform its citizens fully about.
 Thank you. Probably the most insightful comment on this.
 I agree. But we should also be aware that the media in the U.K., as they draw close to Brexit, is looking for opportunities to undermine FDI in Ireland. That said, disgraceful if true.
The Observer / Guardian is the most left-wing commercial news organisation in the English speaking world. They have a very clear agenda on all their stories. An single internal memo where a Facebook executive thinks the Irish Taoiseach may support their viewpoint on EU Data Regulations is not evidence of him lobbying on their behalf.  But it makes a great click-bait headline on the Journal.The established Irish media generally tend to be more a little more circumspect in their approach. That is a very good thing from any media organisation
 Spot on!
 The Guardian – probably the most pro remain media outlet in the UK, along with The Independent and now The Daily Mail under new ownership. If you want pro Brexit, go read The Daily Telegraph.Why was the last inquiry, for which FB was fined, taken from Ireland by the EU to Brussels when it was the responsibility here to undertake it since their European HQ is in Dublin?
 Kenny offered to lobby on FB’s behalf. There’s nothing “think” about it. The Irish media hide the truth about the endemic political corruption in the country.Enough with your FG spin and lies.
 I query the surprise FG benefactors own most our media
 This journalist is from The Observer?
No he didn’t. The memo doesn’t say that. If you read the original article you might understand it. The article does try to draw that conclusion, but like yourself it has an anti Irish agenda.Enough of your David Doyle lies and spin.
 Click the link at top of this article. It’s the Guardian newspaper reporting on an Observer story by Cadwalladr. Interesting read.
I suggest you read the article.
There is nothing ‘anti Irish’ regarding the article.Supposition and conjecture perhaps but not anti Irish!
 Nothing in the article as published above of the Guardian’s link alludes to what a”Facebook executive thinks”. Both state what Kenny done while President of the EU and Taoiseach of the country.Your “conclusion” that i’m “anti Irish” is another figment of your over active imagination. I am anti FFG and Liebour. That in no way makes me anti Irish.You’re the one on here, as usual, insulting and name calling anyone who dares question your FG spinning. Yet for all you claim about the article, you’ve nothing to back it up your aspersions
 I did read the article. It’s not per se anti Irish, but it is an attempt to blacken Ireland’s reputation by suggesting that the government are compromised by the large amount of US FDI.
Levine apparently wrote  “The prime minister committed to using their EU presidency to achieve a positive outcome on the directive.”That doesn’t say for whom the outcome will be positive. Ms Levine is making the assumption that it would be positive for Facebook. That is an assumption on her behalf. Nothing more.Again Dave I have no links to any political party, hence I am not putting any Fine Gael spin on my posts.Also the use of “FFG” and “Liebour” just shows you have a childish and immature approach to Irish politics. If you want to be taken serious at least try to write like an adult.
 It’s not per se anti-irish?  but only 30 mins ago you said it has an anti-irish agenda.which is it ?make you mind up ?I read the article, please point out to me this anti-irish agenda in the article?
 The two are not mutually exclusive. I explained it in a post further down A reply to  if you are interested.
as I requested … can you please point to out the anti-irish agenda in the article. the two cannot be mutually exclusive – it’s either anti-irish or not. which is it ?
The Observer is effectively the Sunday edition of The Guardian and part of The Guardian Media Group.
 Ms Levine either wrote it, or she didn’t. Where’s the link so people can judge for themselves.I rather  have an apparent childish attitude to Irish politics than the a***licking one you have for the FG minority government.
 Guardian is no longer left-wing.
 You will have to contact the authors of the Observer piece if you want a link to the memo. It is a sealed court document, so you probably will have difficult getting it.The quote from my earlier post is from the Observer article. Since I also have not seen the memo, I cannot verify whether the quote is correct or not. Hence my use of the word “apparently.”
 I will politely disagree with that viewpoint.
“I rather have an apparent childish attitude to Irish politics than the a***licking one you have for the FG minority government.”I rest my case.
 I read the Guardian’s link, if accurate, Kenny was in fact lobbying on behalf of Facebook. The issue is about data protection. We already know FG’s attitude to private and personal data.
 what’s FG’s opinion on private and personal data?? If the are in breach, report them to the data protection commissioner.
 And they are! Tech runs Dublin like Luciano and Lansky ran Havana!!
 Only proves the pull of this government here, gangsters can get away with anything here…
Envelopes ….
More accusations of Fine Gael cronyism. They’re incapable of change.#oustthebackslappers
 If, and it’s a big if, Kenny was lobbying in Facebook’s favour on Data Regulation. Why would he be doing it? Its pretty obvious it would be to  protect Irish jobs.You can argue whether or not that would be a good judgement call. But the comment of “Envelopes …” is just vacuous and childish.
 so is your cultish adherence to jobs at an price.
 It appears you have difficult comprehending a fairly straight forward post. Please point out to me where I advocated “jobs at an [sic] price.”
 spin unit must be down staff, you seem to be the only one commenting on any negative FG comments
 incapable . Of change. Of which there is no proof . Based on your assessment. Yawn
  Sunday with an unexpected snowfall.  I guess he was the only one able to get online in a hurry.
 Yes brown ones are particularly nice.
 what’s in for me? culture in the Dáil.
 Empty  or Full
 Your continued ability to blindly defend government corruption never ceases to amaze me…
 I am not defending corruption of any type. I am just pointing out that people are blindly shouting corruption without any analysis of the actual story.I am amazed by the intellectual shallowness of the readers of the Journal.
 How do you know he didn’t get a payment from Facebook it is not childish or vacuous. Serious questions need to be answered and sorry i don’t have much faith in this compromised country and it’s political system.
 There is zero evidence to support that assertion. The Observer article is not making that assertion. Reasonable people don’t go around making completely fabricated allegations about people.
If true it’s shocking. We’re used to stumbling from one scandal to another here but this takes the absolute biscuit. The days of backhanders and brown envelopes continue, when will we as citizens stand up and say enough is enough We have a relationship with politicians that’s akin to a domestic violence relationship, we’re so abused by politicians that we’re numb to it.
 The people are suffering from StockholmSyndrome.
 Why on earth would it be shocking?, what does it take for fools in this country to not be shocked but expect corruption at all levels of governance, its what people vote for ever election with FF/FG and they are so thick they cannot even realise it….we deserve everything we get and much much more.
 spot on peter.We keep returning them to office then feign shock when they look after big business ahead of the needs of the people of Ireland.People suggesting brown envelopes are totally missing the point. This is not about payments to individuals it is about a failed extreme capatilist ideology that suggests a rising tide lifts all boats. In reality all the ff/fg “promote big business at all costs” policy has done is increase the gap between rich and poor and clean out the middle classes.
That’s the FG way!!!
All part of a larger problem.Media/Journalists, crawling to Politicians to become advisors is one thing butPoliticians, crawling to big corporates/institutions to become board members etc..A large percentage of both selling out the public they claim to represent.The highest level of Poacher turn gamekeeper, not just bringing their skills and experience but hired to manipulate systems in place to protect society.Political history is littered with such abuses. They cost dearly.A 5 year ban required on any new employment where conflict of  interest is evident to assist in dissuading individuals to the point that their knowledge is irrelevant.
 Like former Deputy PM Nick Clegg. They’re all at it.
Some of us have been saying for many years that FG and Facebook, the company, are in each other’s pockets and favour – one looks after the other in a symbiotic relationship (like FG and Denis O’Brien also).The UK Sunday Times previously ran a huge front page story exposing connections between Enda’s own local cumman and the awarding of Irish Water contracts. This too was censored from Irish media, print and radio, at the time.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/kennys-ally-lets-out-office-to-irish-water-ch0xlllwz7l
And people are surprised why exactly!!!.This sleveen little hoor has royally shafted this country and like his predecessor’s  he will get away with it.I say fair play to him because he managed to get away with it thanks to the people that voted for them.
 A wonderfully intelligent comment as always Tommy. If this is the type of analysis we get from Sinn Fein members, you’ll excuse me If I don’t take your party in any way seriously.
 I am no member of SF but I can assure you 100% that Tommy is spot on.
 Another stunning example of your intellect Tommy. Well done.
 your pathetic attempts to get a rise out of the adults isn’t working.
“fog off you utter muppet.”, “This sleveen little hoor has royally shafted this country”You think you are an adult. That is  hilarious Tommy.
 Are you going to set your staffi on me?
 try as hard as you want ,I’ll  just keep reporting you .Then fg will be  minus 1 troll.
 And petty as well. You have so many positive attributes. Talk soon.
 reported again , you just can’t resist can you.
 Tommy, Please stop harassing me.
 You Are The one doing the harassing and trolling.You’re track record and postings will vouch for that.
 You are better backing down at this rate, The Journal does have a hide commenter limit.
 Here here
Fine Gael sold out the entire EU and all of it’s citizens for a few pieces of silver.
They were talking about this on the BBC this morning. This sort of stuff strikes at the very credibility of this country.. It’s very embarrassing that it’s come out that Ireland was prepared to use its Presidency of the EU to act in the interest of a company that doesn’t want or wants to seriously restrict regulation of the internet. This is a scandal given what facebooks objectives are.
Another” pillar of society ” exposed to be a deceitful liar.
Fine Gael, incompetence AND corruption… and still people continue to support them.
 And will. Approximately 30% In fact, always and forever no matter what they do…
Enda the clown prince of Fine Gael, useless.
 Sounds like something FF would do (for a few quid though)
 And I am not defending Enda the Turnip or FG either.
 A snake in the grass more likely.It’s easy to imagine how much he aided he who must not be named also.
 Do you mean Dennis o’ Brien ?
 Lord Voldemort
 We can call him a “clown” all we like but that doesn’t change the fact that a not even remotely qualified schoolteacher who inherited daddy’s seat rose to the most powerful position in the country, walked away with a 5K a week pension with very favourable taxation and somehow hasn’t gone down as one of the most ineffective and corrupt leader’s we’ve had in living memory.Who literally sold out his own country and crippled it for generations to come at the behest of the EU and foreign interest groups, went back on his own policies, lied to the electorate (USC, property taxes anyone?) and whose legacy is record levels of homelessness, bad debt, a healthcare crisis, population growth that is now below replacement levels and a brain drain of the educated middle classes lost to emigration….No other country outside of the US or African dictatorships can one person do so much damage and walk away with not only no repercussions and a bagful of taxpayer money for their trouble but with the reputation intact, protected by our joke of a media. If he’s clown the what the hell are the rest of us?
 I take issue with you on your comment. I do think believe Kenny was / is corrupt. I can’t argue about anything else you said.
 Self interest is always corrupting. Being corrupt doesn’t necessarily mean you need to engage in illegal activities. Cronyism is a prime example.
 @Sarah We are talking here about “Legal Corruption” at which Ireland surely tops the world table. Also Kenny protected hoards of white collar criminals which makes him corrupt – full stop.
EU won’t like this.
 yes they will. Tax harminisation happening next year anyway. They’ll all move to the eu mainland soon.
Disgraceful stuff. Also heard today the gov were thinking of setting up some committee. Didn’t hear the full story but one of the main directives was that it should be made up of former politicians. I think a FF guy suggested it and then  harris made a statement saying it was a good idea! Talk about looking after themselves. You couldn’t make this stuff up!
If Ireland needed an enema, Dáil Éireann is where they’d stick the tube.
“Really hope your journalists in Ireland pay attention to this” … they’re on the government’s payroll and write fluff and positive pieces for them
Aaaagh. Stop bringing the dipsh**ts name back into the spotlight. Took long enough to get rid of him.
FG = Facebook goons
More evidence of the utter corruption FG are engaged in.
LOL @ The Journal,  Cracking picture of a dodgy looking Kenny, to kickstart the proceedings,he reminds me of Boycie in Only fools and horses when he is trying to sell you a car
It’s designed to influence the weak minded.  They have difficulty comprehending the nuances of the article and associated references. A picture of Kenny looking shifty gets their agenda across to them much more succinctly.
 yeah, cool story bro…
 Jesus the overtime must be good in the Strategic Comms unit. Go home and enjoy your Sunday ye creep.
What rock did your crawl out from under?I have no links whatsoever to Fine Gael or any political party.I find it fascinating that there are so may complete and utter idiots on this site who’s default position is “Uggh! Fine Gael / Fianna Fáil bad” If you read the article and the Observer piece you’ll find it has a very specific agenda. And it really has little with Kenny. and a lot to do with undermining Ireland’s FDII will assume from your comment that you don’t have the intellectual capacity to understand that. There must be a certain comfort in being so thick that complex events are of no concern to you.
 So this is what you perceive as a conspiracy on FDI, by whom and for what purpose?By Cadwalladr of all people?
There is no conspiracy. As I mentioned before, the Observer / Guardian is the most left-wing commercial news organisation in the English speaking world. They have a vested interest in large multi national corporations, such as Facebook being restricted in the way they do business and how they pay taxes. In this instance, they are trying to say that Ireland is compromised by its large reliance in US FDI, and that it give the likes of Facebook disproportionate political power.They are attacking our FDI in an attempt to attack Facebook. It’s not rocket science.
 what rock did you crawl out from other…idiots …  I see you your double standards are evident again. you attack others for immaturity and then proceed to act like a little school yard bully,
 When people call me “creep”, I generally treat them with distain.
 again I’m only pointing your your level of immaturity when you also respond in such fashion. By all means call me names if it’s makes you feel better. I won’t go down that particular road myself.
 Where did I call you names?
 That’s your conclusion, not mine. Guess we’ll find out in the next few days from the leadership team (sic)
 The reply to your other question is contained in a post earlier in this thread.
Fair enough.I am afraid I don’t understand your “leadership team” reference. “(sic)” usually indicated it is a reference to a quote. I am pretty sure I didn’t make any reference to any “leadership team.”
 you didn’t.  but you are prone to it when others don’t align to your way of thinking – thats all i was referring  too. Please practice what you preach.Goodnight sir.
 Thanks Ian. and a goodnight to you also.
Hello is that Fine Gael Head Office. I have a plan to create some jobs but I need a wagon load of cash and a special deal on tax.No bother we’ll get moving on that and we can chat about the other arrangements in the middle of the Phoenix Park at 5am in Sunday morning.See you then.
One of the most corrupt little countries on earth. It seems all our politicians are cut from the same cloth. Corruption & this country run hand in hand & its mainly down to our politicians doing favours for their cronies
Why are we surprised by these revelations? Doesn’t this happen worldwide by many politicians including Ming?
 Ming has done nothing wrong, he has been an excellent representative for the people of rural Ireland.If you are not man or woman enough to use your own name then no one gives a flying fcku what you think.
 Didn`t you run in the local elections in Letterkenny in 2014 for labour and didn`t make it ?
 Labour represented very few of their voters in 2011. no surprise they are the dodo of the Dail.
If we only knew  what was going behind our backs
I’ve never voted FF/FG in 20 years. Imagine how I feel
 I feel you pain…
Pure and utter cream cracker!!
 The inventor of many a fiction story.
Senior politician lobbies on our behalf for a huge multinational investment… is that not what they are meant to do ?
 No. They are supposed to make legislation that benefits the people of Ireland. Not banks, not Vulture funds, not Corporations.
 He didn’t lobby on our behalf, he lobbied on behalf of Facebook. Essentially a representative of a private company while Taoiseach of this country.
 Read the article. Nothing to do with investment, that’s corporation tax. It’s about protecting, or rather not protecting personal data. Kenny wouldn’t have been involved, others in the food chain.
 On who’s behalf???
The Observer? I think I’ll wait and see how this develops before I comment on Enda Kenny.
 If RTE play it down or do their usual, don’t report anything that exposes FG, it won’t develop at all.
 Ah! A sane and educated person. We are a rarity on this thread.
 expose what ?
Is that corruption ?
 no it’s not Mary..A politician working in the national interest.. it’s a cheap Brexit shot by the observer.. non story .. think of all the promises the UK government made to nissan…. no difference …
 Trying your best there John, but it is corruption .. Sorry about that… Dry your eyes mate
Well Well, Does Ming’s opinion count for much??
 Over an exposed repeated fiction maker? Quite possibly.
Shock horror luke Ming Flanagan lobbies on behalf of turd cutters direct to European parliament… thousands of jobs at stake
 You’ve a low opinion of the rural community who elected him, why?
 in never said that anywhre … I mispelt … I meant turf cutters BTW…. luke will rightly lobby on behalf of the people who elect him so what’s wrong with another politician lobbying Facebook on behalf of the people that elected him or in the national interest.. it’s a stupid non story being stirred up by the obverver..
 he lobbied on behalf of Facebook. Are you suggesting that Facebook had a part in electing him?how many people from Mayo lobbied him in relation to this?
 and again what is wrong here…that’s what politicians do to bring in foreign direct investment … observer spinning shite … they are jealous that’s all   … has he broken any law … all politicians will lobby on behalf of their constituents.. how bad .. do we sit back and let other countries take the jobs or investment… we fight for them within the rules of the land we live in …
 did I say it was wrong ?As you know so much about this story, educate me on how this was in the national interest ?
 jobs jobs jobs jobs jobs and more jobs
 educate me on why it’s in the national interest NOT to protect personal data ? I’m truly interested in how that is in the natural interest, that is after all what Enda  Kenny lobbied for.
 0% related to jobs, jobs, jobs. corporation tax takes care of that.
Corrupt f#ckers the lot of them. Gangsters
 what is corrupt here …?
No surprise here, Kenny knows what side his bread is buttered on and like Bertie he will take full advantage of his position to further his own agenda.
The pic of Enda Kenny says it all.   A real Fr Ted look
the question is , was there brown envelopes involved
I would take this story with a huge pinch of salt. I am very loathed to give credence to any reports on Ireland coming from the UK or US media. Just because someone says so doesn’t mean it’s true. They will have to provide hard evidence to prove the veracity of their claim. Until then I would suggest that people don’t jump to conclusions.
Do the math:1 Politician + 1 politician = 2 pieces of shite.
FB employ 4000 people here. Lobbying government should hardly be surprising. Both the current and previous data commisioners have said Kenny or FG never tried to influence data laws or lobby on FB’s behalf. So it is fake malicious news.
Nothing new here. Enda Kenny was and is a puppet of the body corporate. So is his Fine Gael party and it’s new “leader” Varadkar and Michael Martin and Fine Fáil (CETA / ISDS) and the Labour Party. We have long since moved from Democracy to Corpocracy.See my TED Talk below – Ireland:- Democracy or Corpocracy?https://youtu.be/dpjWhZk0mvw

If it was the Irish Farmers Association or our fishermen or the GAA or any other Irish native industry would it be incumbent upon the taoiseach to represent their views at EU level and even try to negotiate something more favourable to them….  so just because it is Facebook with their headquarters in Ireland everyone is in a tizzy….  slow down.Would not the UK government support their car industry or the French support Airbus, the Spanish their fishing trawlers – there is a lot of diplomatic language in the article (the observer quotes) such as a “favourable outcome” without saying exactly what it was, sort of cloak and dagger stuff and let’s be clear Facebook had special relationship with loads of politicians…..    it is interesting that Nick Clegg was involved when deputy prime minister of the UK and now works for Facebook and the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said he would “figure out how to get more involved”Seems there was and is a lot of lobbying and politicians leaving companies with the impression that they are “on their side” which is an essential element of placation which goes on everywhere – not saying that it is right but if just one country plays the game then everyone must leave a good cooperative impression or loose the business to another state.This works even at local level when politicians are approached to make representations on constituents behalf, and appear to get things done that would have happened anyway, they get the vote next time around…    so what is wrong with creating the impression you are on the side of one of the larger employers in the country?  At least he is not working for facebook, unlike others and there is a hint that this is trying to shift any scandal from George Osborne…    of course I could be wrong…. GDPR was a pain for many companies and some have not applied and block content to the EU as a result… I am not saying the system is right, but it is the system under which we operate so why are we surprised?(sourcehttps://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/02/facebook-global-lobbying-campaign-against-data-privacy-laws-investment)The then chancellor used the meeting with Sandberg to ask Facebook to invest in the government’s Tech City venture, the memo claims, and Sandberg said she would “review” any proposal. In exchange, she asked him to become “even more active and vocal in the European Data Directive debate and really help shape the proposals”. The memo claims Osborne asked for a detailed briefing and said he would “figure out how to get more involved”.
 very well said … a load of observer horseshite… politicians doing their job.. all parties politicians lobby on our behalf … even Luke Ming Flanagan…
 Kenny had already sold farmers and fishermen out.
 And property and water…

Why would anyone care what Enda Kenny does now?
 The two biggest celebrities in the world seem to care :)
It’s surprising how many people don’t know that Enda Kenny is a 10 handicap polo player, the only player in Ireland to ever reach that level.He could easily have played professional polo if he hadn’t opted to serve his country out of the goodness of his heart.
 what’s a Fine Gael ‘click’?
Do you think Gerry Adams wouldn’t have done the same given half a chance?
 ah Micky, you don’t click it at all, do you?
What did he ever do in Govnt?
 You obviously care enough…to; 1. Click on + read the Item, and 2. Write a comment about dear Enda…
 He has put his name or signed to this charity and has raised a lot of money among his wealthy friends
Fair play and well done for a good cause.
 idiot
 sickening but shows FG for what they are. Toadies.
https://www.rt.com/uk/433773-prince-charles-pedophile-bishop/Good causes????
It turns out no one really cares…..
 I’d like to think some people care about children with HIV and AIDS…
 absolutely but I’m talking about Enda as he grabbed the headline
 well you obviously cared enough to comment
 you seem to care only about a  bottle of beer in front of you. What a wonderful contrabution to mankind!
What ever happened to Fine Gael’s Five Point Plan?http://www.thejournal.ie/fine-gael-five-point-plan-1256969-Jan2014/
 fully implemented, that’s why ireland is booming again, all thanks to Enda the great :)
 the only thing booming is the number of people in hallways waiting on beds
 I pity the hate filled nobodies like you, all that anger eating away at you :)
 Crumbling health service, homelessness, housing crisis, scandal after scandal.  The party F.F. That facilitated the gangsterism of the banks and developers now keep in power a thatcherite party of paracites. If you call that an economic boom, you are sadly mistaken
Billy the great… what?Certainly not troll. Fairly weak at that.answers in the comment section
Jeeze, it was for a charitable cause. Give over. His appearance hasn’t harmed anyone but if it helped raise money for this cause fair play.
 Oh that bit is irrelevant, it is all about who can we speak ill of..I will probably be next.
 What a bunch of begrudgers Mary. Delighted mind you they don’t represent Irish society at large.
 You can’t always judge a book by the cover Mary. A lot of people use charities for their own good.
What a plonker.
 Yea support a children’s HIV charity- i mean how dare he
 It doesn’t matter what Enda does, he’s a plonker.
 yes and he’s doing it for free I bet
 ah, no, Micky. They actually don’t have citizens beyant.
Enda Kenny’s Broken Promiseshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=523FLk2126g
Completely out of touch Enda Kenny speaking gibberish on RTE News thinks the minimum wage is €35,000https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je0gwdNWNSg
He wasn’t too worried about the health and mental wellbeing of the young people he was responsible for as Taoiseach. But photo opportunities with “royals” are not to be missed are they?
Textbook wide eyed camera hogger!
Not so much a case of it being a charity he supports for humanitarian purposes,but a charity he supports because it was set up by the type of people he wants to ingratiate himself with
Is this really Enda Kenny’s idea of how to ‘man up’?http://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/gene-kerrigan/is-this-really-enda-kennys-idea-of-how-to-man-up-30852845.html
 You are not obsessed at all :D
NOT ONE CENT MORE .. is all I remember him saying
Enda Master Debaterhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZbXDbV2XQ0#t=11
He looks fierce confused!
Been awhile since I heard anything about Edna.
Nice little earner for enda
I wonder how exactly he supports it. Is it like how Bono & Bob Geldof support charities.
 Or the Irish tax system?
The journal needs to take a serious look at itself plenty print for a silly season pro Fine Gael story its stock and trade. No space to comment on the Ruth Morrisseys story on the callous treatment of her cervical cancer diagnosis by the Fine Gael Government despite its spin of lovey dovey treatment of the victims of cervical cancer victims. The Leo is love sick Irish journalists turn a blind eye
Some people on here need to get a life, leave the man alone. He took this country back form the edge of a cliff
 He made an economic collapse look good by the time he was finished… Imposed draconian austerity measures to repay for the gangsterism of the banks and developers, went from one scandal into another.  His legacy, crumbling health service,homelessness, housing crisis, stumbled from one scandal into another.  Do you not ironic.. The party F.F. That brought this country to it’s knees now keep in power Kenny,s thatcherite party.
Kenny. The toddle along” fool
Omg shoot me
Nice Jockey on the left . Riding Anyone ?
An article about a photograph without the photograph in question. Strange.
Turns out I care less. Why even post this article ?
 Bow down to your leaders
the royal jester must have been out sick yesterday
I’m appalled at the politics in this country.
 your more than welcome to leave
 You’re!!
 *You’re.  Stupid reply though anyway, even if it was written properly
 strange response. Why should I leave? Are you saying I can’t be critical about politics in my own country.
 thanks for the correction
 Be careful now ,if tom Ryan has his way ,we will all be living in exile.
Pot/Kettle, what a plonker. He should be concerned about how his beloved Blueshirts are pandering to investment corporations and neglecting the real issues affecting the  people of Ireland today. They don’t care about the homeless and the ill people queueing on trolleys to get hospital beds. They won’t give us a referendum on the ownership of our water despite the clear message given to them by the people. They stood by two Ministers for Justice despite the recent Garda scandals. Broken promises galore. I could go on….
 ___ Even the Healy-Raes are better than what’s on offer in Westminster.
 Ahhhhhh,now that’s food for thought!
 appalled? Ireland is getting better now and it’s so pity you wouldn’t even admit this
 god, if you’re appalled at the politics in this country i wonder what you think about countries such as Afghanistan.
 So you’ll vote left wing, won’t you Frank? You’d hardly vote for them or FF and whinge that they do their thing?
 I’m appalled by the commentators.
 Anyone can leave, including you.
 Enda Kenny, the original remote control for the remote control.
 He’s more than entitled to air his opinion. We live in a democratic country.
 That’s the answer to the problem is it Tom. Grow up.
This a brilliant summing up of Enda`s award from Luke “Ming” Flanagan.Enda Kenny was presented with an award today by the European Movement in Ireland. The award was for “Irish European of the Year”. However the award is nothing more than a self congratulatory slap on the the back.You see the European Movement has an Honorary President. His name is Leo Varadkar. Before Leo got the job Enda held the position. On the board of the European Movement Ireland is Jillian Van Turnhout. Jillian became a senator as result of a Taoiseach’s nomination by Enda Kenny.Of course such an organisation must be funded. Where does it get it’s funding from? €200,000 from the department of the Taoiseach.So basically today we have had to listen to wall to wall coverage of Enda giving an award to himself. Worse still. You had to pay for it.
 That would be less than half of its income: it also has member subscriptions and payment for projects it undertakes for other organizations.I think Ming may be putting too much emphasis on honorary presidents.http://www.europeanmovement.ie/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Annual-Report-2016-FINAL-PDF.pdf
 Well stupid paddy pays for everything…..but why are we surprised by this…..kenny, noonan and the rest that went before them are traitors….but does anyone care….varadkar will be next up in a few years for the same BS award.
 is a European movement going to the toilet in Europe.   Endas legacy hospital waiting lists. Housing lists. Lack of public transport infrastructure. Overpriced utilities. Overpriced insurance.  Etc etc
 what a clown Ming is!
 you nailed it there. How about running for office,you already know where you can do the cuts and save the taxpayer money might even build a few houses with whats saved.
 the words “circle jerk” spring to mind..
 Sums it up…
 Well said,And yet funding cant be found for Ireland to join CERN or the Southern European Consolation programs to encourage high industries here.
Sounds like Enda wants a job in Europe…
 Yeah thats his Plan
 and he will get a nice tasty plumb one….that’s the dividend for obeying the EU mafia eurocrats in brussells.
 Shouldn’t that be “Eu Lapdog of the Year”?.
 With a very generous pension to look forward to I doubt he’ll bother.
 Yes the famous pat on the head could be worth a lot to him yet!
 He licked enough as* while in office to be a cert for a Euro job.
He should be appalled at his own tenure in government.
 indeed…kenny and noonan sold out this republic to the vulture fund globalists and paddy is left to be screwed once again.
 why? Look at the mess Fianna Fail left? Half of them should be jailed for the mess they left!
 Kenny and Noonan managed through the effective bankruptcy if the country to get it up and running again by landing billions in foreign investment and creating jobs and – unlike Fianna Fail – didn’t blow it the first time people called for payouts. Are people’s memories really that short and selective that they can’t see that? ?
 FF called in the TROIKA yes, they are ultimately responsible but FG bowed to every whim Europe asked for. This was taxpayer money that was used to keep the banks afloat and the EU bailout is now still propping up the banks while people are being forced to sleep in cars and tents to appease the banking greed.Countless people have taken their lives due to pressure from the bailed out banks and Kenny never batted an eyelid.He deserves to burn in the fires of hell for putting Europe before his own countrymen and women.
 Noonan and his “Sure Vultures do a good job” quote still sticks in my mind among his many smarmy answers.
 No my memory is not short.I remember Enda ringing a bell with Dinny O’ Br*en .Remember that champ?
 Can you help me comprehend exactly why?
 If people who lost their jobs during the 08 crash and had been paying taxes all their working lives, do you not think they deserve a break from the bank that their taxes have helped save?
I’m appalled at Enda’s lump sum on retirement and annual pension.
Kenny is a national embarassment. The welfare of Ireland is not the top priority to the UK gov. Also I think it’s very telling these guys (kenny, cowan and bertie) would probably jump at a job in the EU but the EU people don’t want them because the fact is they know they bankrupt their own country. The Irish gombeens who vote them in think they’re good enough to run Ireland but the EU people know the facts.
 Not sure if you’ve ever ready the news. First of all Ireland was never bankrupt. Now if it was the economic downturn you were referring to the economic downturn of 2008, that was caused by the banks and insufficient regulations overseen by Cowen and Ahern. Why exactly have you included Kenny in your comment?
Didn’t mean to say the same thing twice^^ but you get my message
 Ahern/Cowan deserve to be ostracised, but if you want to get technical the economic downturn was caused by a crash in the global financial markets.  I have not doubt that there would have been little difference in the impact on Ireland had Fine Gael been in power. In fact, it appears they are just continuing the boom/bust cycle.
 Because Kenny underwrote commercial debts with sovereign credit and then watched as the ECB/EU made Ireland pay 42% of the cost of keeping the Euro afloat when it should have been allowed to fail also.
Still waiting for Enda’s ‘end of cronism’. That and the referendum to protect our water supply from FGs cronies.
He should shut his face ,its nothing to do with him.he was a complete clown trying to run his own country .
 it may not have anything to do with him but he is certainly entitled to have an opinion and that’s all it is and that’s good for democracy unlike dictating for someone to shut there face.
 He’s not wrong, though. And the UK Opposition is equally useless.
 Except in this case he is making a public statement, so ,as you are saying ,we are BOTH entitled to our opinions.
 He is right though, perhaps put aside your prejudices here. This will really upset some of the British folks criticising the EU and Irish government for their stance who seem to think Kenny was somewhat on their side.
 whether he makes a statement in public or private he is still entitled to have and to make the statement and if you think not maybe you should go and live in north Korea.
 it has everything to do with us. Our economy could be very adversely affected . No point in saying he should “shut his face”:  they are not listening, they don’t care,  they cant/won’t do anything.
 Ok, but if am British, could I then tell him to mind his own business?
 as am I.
 If you’re British on an Irish news forum you might show more decorum. You are entitled to your opinion, but using Daily Express insults, such as, “Shut your mouth!”, just isn’t classy and IF you were British, you’d simply be showing them in a poor light!
 don’t be so foolish brexit is as much an Irish problem and Ireland needs to stand up and protect it’s own interest looking at your picture I’d never have taken you for someone that’s sounds so stupid.
 Do you have an opinion on brexit or is it all just pointless invective?
 Actually,I am neither  foolish nor stupid,but I am at an age when it takes less and less to make me angry. And I am very seldom so bitter about things that I will let fly like this. Old age and tolerance are not compatible.
 Maybe you should shut your own face, idiot.
UCD or the Royal College of Surgeons or whoever need to petition for all TD’s bodies, especially Ministers, to be donated to science; as there has to be groundbreaking revelations around a shameless, ignorant, and inept part of the brain that has not been fully explored. Take your pension and run for the hills Kenny, ya watermelon, don’t set us up to slate you
We are still waiting for your democratic revolution ,enda .not much has changed another boom another bust ,same old same old .
‘The government is driven by internal descent’!Well, yes.
Mr West Brit himself opens his beak. He’s no nationalist as he demonstrated countless times when not only accepted a deeply immoral bailout but accepted the blame on behalf of Irish people. He now demonstrates nothing but resentment for a country that wants to self-determine. People like Enda Kenny are in favour or the EU because they themselves do not warm to responsibility and are cynical about politics in general – he likes his money for nothing and his drinks for free.
 Exactly, so if the border issue goes belly up, it’ll be due to the EU recommendations. This is turning into an anti Brit campaign more than anything, criticize negotiations = OK, criticize a democracy = not good. Careful Varadkar, Coveney and indeed Barnier – May is not in a position of strength in UK politics. You need to understand what she can give as well as what you would like. Push too far and put her in a corner and it’ll all go pear shaped. You want Johnson or Davis as UK pm, keep pushing May till she topples over.
 Yeah, throw in a good dose of racism, colonial entitlement, and historical ignorance and you’ve got England down. So brave and courageous of you after centuries of oppression upon countless nations to throw off the shackles of the EU and still not take a gee hair’s worth of ‘responsibility’ for your country toxic legacy. But the Royal wedding was nice, wasn’t it?
Commenters on here saying that irish politicians should mind their own business and shut up regarding brexit are echoing the opinions of Unionists and British nationalists who really hate or have no interest in Ireland. If there is a hard border, make no mistake the troubles will be back again and probably with renewed support in the Republic. Irish people who support brexit don’t ever spare a thought for what will happen to the north if it is not handled with utmost care.
 Plus, we’re all Europeans and we ought to care about the future of the EU and Europe.
 Europe will be grand. Its looking like one of the last bastions of sanity in an increasingly crazy world. TBH I’m more worried about the North than Europe.
 It won’t be grand if we’re complacent about it being grand. It’s facing a lot of challenges.
 You may want to be ruled by China and Russia, but I don’t.
 I’m pro europe but I’m pro what’s 50 miles down the road even more. Don’t pay attention to the above troll by the way with his oh so topical and hilarious name. How he managed to breakaway from 4 chan and hentai for the time it took to create a twitter handle I’ll never know.
 Explain why Ireland should leave the EU? How is it going to be better for us?
 What if, what if…
Kenny the biggest Euro a kisser ever born. He sold his country out for the benefit of his Euro pals & a cushy number with Merkel in Europe
I’m appalled at that picture of Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum.  Kenny couldn’ look any more like Doogle McGuire if he tried.  And then there’s  Varadker trying to look like his usual I am too cool for school self.  Both are pathetic yes men.
The government is driven by internal descent?????  Surely dissent!
Best boy in the class,he gave them everything they wanted and they kept taking.kenny is a clown.
In Britain??? What about your own people???
I am appalled how many people have to emigrate from Ireland to find work. I am appalled at how we still rely on Britain so much after 100 years of so called independence. I am appalled that those in Dail Eireann are on the same salaries as politicans in Britain where the population is 70 million.
How did this crowd of idiots become a government ? If this is democracy, U.K. citizens deserve what is coming to them in the next few years. Irish politics and democracy ain’t so bad compared to the shambles that the U.K. seems to be becoming now.
Thr ROI has to change if it wants a peaceful United Ireland, IMO.The ROI has to:-Change the constitution to enable a secular State-Decentralise Government by establishing 4 strong provinces like the Canadian model-Allocate reponsibility for education, health & welfare to the provinces-Enable the provinceds to collect tax-redistribute the VAT pro rata to the Provinces-Abolish the Co Councils-Exclude Churches from public primary & secondary education-Religious  education should be privately fundedAs such, this would allay most of the fears held by the Unionists about having fair and equitable treatment in a United Ireland. The Catholic Church has had untoward influenceon the ROI since 1922 and it is about time to debunk it given its horrible track record in te 20th Century.We need a modern secular Ireland, not a continuation of Medieval sectarian conflict, so that that we are not seen by others as silly apologists for an obsolete Holy Roman Empire.
Simple fix social welfare easy money payments, we should have by now been been tighter than the Swiss for world banking and an expanded ifsc, to attract everyone, manufacturing in the rural areas needs grants or reduced min wage, Ireland needs a tidy up as a holiday destination , oh and action not words
Im appalled by how Ireland is now let’s fix it !!! As if we’re so bloody slick
 What about the country would you change?
 I’ve not got all night
Should the picture not say “ two dicks no balls “
And Kenny I am disgusted with the corruption in the Politics,Banking system which screwed us all and as for the Policing of our state ,when the Gardai are doing down one of their own ,what chance have the little people.
What a stupid stunt!
Ireland are the EU stooges – why else would Kenny get that job. We need to get a vote on our continued existence as EU puppets.
Is April 1st today ?
 voted By Enda Kenny
No, no! You haven’t read the article.He’s the European Movement of the year.Bowel no doubt.
 the first annual European Union awards for outstanding achievement in the field of excellence
 Kenny for European of the year doesn’t say much about Europe, does it?
Is this a Waterford Whispers post?
 I think Viz were first to break this story ;-)
If it was European yes-man of the year, I agree.
Knob of the year more like
 a knob is useful for something!!!
Vote Míng for galactic Emperor.
   it would be a more deserving award!
 I remember him in Galway about 20 years ago running for election for maybe local council not sure and only got 80 voters people were laughing at him. Amazing what he has achieved with persistence.
 On the advice of a friend I started following his European escapades. And fair dues, he’s well on top of it.
 Unlikely. He’s been in the Dail since 1975…
 think Jonathan was talking about Ming…Not Enda.
 yes exactly Mick I used to see Ming around Galway all the time. He played snooker a lot in Edlinton St.
Ming? His attendance record at the European Parliament is shocking.
This has to be a joke right?
 Who would you suggest should run it
 It doesn’t matter who is suggested because they can’t get a look in as long as FFG can have a coalition that isn’t and claim a mandate they haven’t, while hobbling the elected opposition.
A lean year for outstanding Europeans
 Nigel Farage?
 Lean lean lean…..
He’s not even Castlebar Man of The Year
Outstanding in his field is our Enda.Scarecrow of the year.
Jesus wept
and drumm will get honest banker of the year
Is he the only nominee??
FFS
 No FGS (Fine Gael sake)
Waterford Whispers?
Sweet Baby Beeejeeebus tell me this isn’t true.
What a joke!
So the European Movement Ireland are giving him an award. So it’s not been voted by other Europeans just a few lads in Ireland lol , they’re probably made up of some ex cronies and party members
A really nice way of saying “you’re not getting that commissioner job”
 very funny & probably accurate LOL ! I’d cringe if he gotUp as high as EU Commissioner level, he’d do even more damage to what’s left of our country & our sovereignty …
Tosser of the year would have a nicer ring to it..
Brass neck awards
All playing into a cushy Europe job for Enda. Does sycophancy towards towards the ECB make one a good European??
Wow must have been a short list of nominees if they can pick him
 If he was the only one, he still shouldn’t get it.
There’s really no better European then him?
  Yes. He was / is pro – E.U. He is entitled to his now personal opinion. As a public representative, he was made Taoseach by our parliament who knew that he was in favour of E.U. principles. So, why not Enda Kenny ?
  Oops, sorry. I just saw your question mark.
 Really? S pathological liar, incapable of telling the truth or forming a sentence on his own.
Thought Brian Cowen had worked out a deal that he’d receive this every year in recognition of his enthusiasm for beggaring his own people to take EU debt into their backs for generations to come. Great European.
A spokesperson for EMI says Mr Kenny was selected for the award for his work during Ireland’s EU presidency in 2013, getting Ireland through the IMF/ECB/EU bailout programme and helping to lay the groundwork for brexit.I would suggest that Enda’s oversight and implementation of phase one austerity policies went along way toward his nomination, the spineless lacky.
 Sure under his leadership didn’t Ireland not only take on 42% of European banking debt,paid all bondholders despite his pre GE pledges and failed to take the opportunity as party with large mandate after GE to renegotiate Troika deal with debt relief,etc like Prof Mody said FG could have done&Prof Mody called that “a lost opportunity…instead banking debt converted to sovereign debt without any fight…with devastating consequences on ordinary Irish people.
 Dead right Nuala and this must never be forgiven or forgotten. Every time a fg or ff leech comes looking for your vote this should be rammed down their throats.
Very low standards.
I bet Dennis O`Brien is gonna make a fortune hiring out the old crowd control barriers to surround the Shelbourne . Stop the hordes getting anywhere near their Absolute Hero,We owe him so much…….
Are you having a bloody laugh???
Seems to me like FG are inventing their own awards and presenting themselves with these awards in order to improve their image.
Is it someone’s last day in the journal & they are taking the p*ss??
 maybe someone robbed their phone in the can?
Enda Kenny is neck and neck with Nethanyahu for Statesman of the world too i believe
Is this Waterford whispers? Enda Kenny is an embarrassment!
 and so is leo
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah….No really *wipes tears from laughing*
I need to go and have a lie down.
I’m grown up enough to recognise a blue shirt enthusiast…..
Then we wonder why people want to leave Europe & Brexit
And why not,  he oversaw the destruction of a nation,  for his European paymasters !
Orla Ryan just because your stuck in an office in this great heat all day doesn’t mean you can start a fake news story
Will he get another pension for that?wats he at ,havent seen or heard of him lately,small loss
 No but he might get another little pat on the head.. sure isnt he a great lad altogether…
The Journal is funny ;-)
Looks like they must have scraped the bottom of the barrel
Jesus wept.. who was on the judging panel?
 Trump
Don’t like the man or his party but FairPlay to him. Hadn’t a great hand to deal when he took over in 2011
 only the recovery plan was already written by Lenihan and the Troika. Everything he did in his own was an absolute clusterf*
LOL
Well, he is down as the president of ‘European Movement Ireland’. Must have been a slow day in the office..
The man can hardly string a sentence together without a script or ear piece etc, An accidental Leader of this country who got voted in due to the shambles FF left the country in.Although it’s funny looking at clips back in the hey day with Inda &FG saying that the FF/PD govt were not spending enough money etc.
Is this a joke.A man who cut the country’s people and it’s services to the bone being given a top European award.The FG/Labour coalition had us on our knees and future generations will continue to pay for generations.The Fianna Fáil govt that were in power previously betrayed the Irish people by agreeing to look after the bond holders .Enda Kenny along with the right wing Labour Party continued the betrayal of the Irish people.Im disgusted at this award being given. What next.Berty and Brian Cowen should get the award too.Gerry Malone Dundalk
Ha ha who did the judge Stevie wonder
Nooooooooo
Of course he is sure wasn’t  he behind the implementation of the Kalergi plan in Ireland good man Enda
Maybe Leo might ask Kenny for a few hints on how to try become even more arrogant & full of himself as Leo already is.gas thing is Leo thinks he’s done great
How about Theresa May?
You couldn’t make this up. Ohhh wait it’s Ireland it’s a daily thing.
Seriously what group of sad people voted him  this?
Sure he’s a great European, didn’t he sell us down the river to bail them out
Pukefest.  Who invented this organization and why. ?
This is madness, this underachieving dope who sold the country out to his EU masters is Man of the Year? Makes you wonder who was in second place?
Seriously what group of sad people voted him this ?
Well done and we’ll deserved.
 haha haha ye have a sense of humour I’m dying here
Seriously how sad are the Irish ..
It’s time we leave as well,Doritos
Ffs
Funny how Rumpelstiltskin (M O’Leary) and and at least one Irish Minister this time Passsssschal O’Donouhue gets a yearly invote sorry invite to theBILDERBERG CONFERENCE.I guess the fact that MOL is responsible for the circulation migrant labour non labour/ erosion of borders.And Paschal is the key master to the 12.5% (less mostly) tax avoidance charade guarantees your seat at the Carcass yearly…..
A great decision…you bunch of millenials will never realise how good this man was until you grow up ….
 90% of commenters are probably older than you in fairness
 Yawn…
 I wish….
Absolute  kn0b r0t
F#*k Off. You have to joking. Is candid camera going to pop out at the Shelbourne
Jesus wept…
Annnnnnnnd…… Jesus wept
What a corrupt little sleazebag. We all partied eh Enda. Says a great deal about the USSEU.
Idiot of the Year
Yer f–kin jokin?
It was his imagery friends who voted for him.
Hope that bastion of incisive and independent reporting is going to interview him on the night.No..Not RTE, that German TV station with the British fella dat did Bertie.Is his prize in a usual FG brown envelope ?
Leave him alone, he’s a legend. He took over a country that was bankrupt and steered it back to prosperity again. He’ll go down in history as one of the best Irish leaders ever.
 Go back to sleep, your raving, next ya will be commenting that mayo will win the all Ireland.
Feck away off with that bullshit, what an ejit
Surely this is the abbreviated title ? The full title being European A*selicker of the year ??
Well Chales J Haughey gets no recognition so I’m not surprised. It’s speak more about the bacons that vote here than anything else
Utter muck….,
Linda Martin & Louis Walsh also honoured for their outstanding contribution to music 1988. Someone get a grip FFS.
Fair play Enda u looked after Europe and forgot where u came from, gombeen
 What do you mean by that illiterate derp?
Blowing smoke up a hole
Oh Lord I do enjoy a good laugh first thing in the morning.
Someone’s def taking the p…!Must b a slow news day …..!But thanks folks…. you’ve just given me a great laugh…..
Its just a game they are  playing making one another look good,,What they fail to do and say they have lined their own pockets,and made millions on the backs of the people
Nice work boys the predictable indignation of pointless waffling clowns.
I am from E.U. and proud of that.Any E.U. country that doesn’t like the principles of E.U. is free to leave. E.U. is not an empire.The days of the British / Spanish / etc. empires are finished.
Is this a joke? Man of the Year!!!! Don’t make me laugh!!
Bertie must be devastated at missing out.
Is that his reward for agreeing to implement Sharia Law in Ireland.

We are not independent yet. Six counties still under British rule. No independence day for me anyway until we are united once More
 The north is not Ireland. They don’t want to be and we shouldn’t force them.
 it is Ireland. But you’re absolutely right, the majority don’t want to be part of our country and we shouldn’t force them….not that we could if we tried anyway. The people living in the north have a far greater claim on that land than anyone in the south.
 I think you’ll find that The North is Ireland and a hell of a lot of people there declare themselves to be Irish.They mightn’t like the way the banana republic is run at the moment, but they’re still Irish and hold Irish passports.
 How?
 Ireland was partitioned against the wishes of the people. Any clown that believes we should have an ‘Independence Day’ while our country remains partioned needs their head examined. Grossly insulting suggestion to Irish citizens in the six counties & to the memory of those countless men & women (particularly those from the six counties) who gave their lives for a 32 county Irish Republic. The Easter Rising, as a prime example, simply would not have happened were it not for two Tyrome men – Tom Clarke (the main organiser) and Joe McGarrity (who provided the lions share of the funding for the arms). They didnt fight for a 26 county Ireland. James Connolly spoke passionately against the notion of partition. Those making this dispicable suggestion are spitting on their graves.
 Last time I checked out was called Northern IRELAND. Yeah not Ireland at all…
 What island do you live on the whole island of Ireland is called IRELAND what school did you go too
 we had a referendum relinquishing the territorial claim to NI. Did you forget?
 The same referendum afforded citizens in the six counties the right to be regarded as Irish. Ireland has always had 32 counties. That did not change in 1921 nor in 1998.
January 21st 1600,Charles Blount was named as Lord Deputy of Ireland by Elizabeth 1st. He brought the 9 years war to an end by his indiscriminate scorched earth policy, this involved destroying anything of use to the Irish fighters including food sources and even people resulting in hundreds of thousands of Irish peasants dying from direct targeting and the resulting famine, the Irish Taoiseach were defeated and were exiled leading to the Flight of the Earls.Considering the history it is wholly inappropriate and offensive to celebrate FF’s semi independence on this day.
 Were you born stupid or did you have to work on it.
 Idiots out in force today
  not true a lot of people in the north do want to be in united ireland and north can vote to be part of that so not politically acurate
 bit like Palestine Elvis King, your beloved Israel trying to illegally oust the Palestinians from their land…get it now?
 spot on
 Last time we were united was in the UK. I share your desire to reunite the UK :-)
 I went to one where people understood the difference between an island and a country/state which shares part of that island with another country/state.
That’s fair point about Patrick’s day. World  famous and a great opportunity for Ireland Inc.But if you’re going to have an Independence Day it should be a public holiday. And is there not a suitable date sometime in the summer?
 I would scrap Patrick’s day for an Independence Day
 st Patrick’s day is the de facto Irish day ,it has been for 100s of years , no amount of shenanigans by the lefties in the dial will change that
 We need to become Independent first
Unless we get a day off nobody is going to care.
No independence day before reunification.
 We already live in a grounghog day of FF/FG government.
Isn’t January 21st the most depressing day of the year?
The day the first Dail sat, so it is right back to being about them again. 24th of April would be a better choice.
 1st April might be more appropriate
 Independence day will be celebrated on the day the country is reunited. Not a moment sooner. Only in Ireland would you get halfwits seeking to have an ‘Independence Day’ while we are still not independent.
 I think you’ll find the republic of Ireland is an independent country why do you think there’s so much talk of a hard border?? Q
 As the piece says, as does cursory googling, 21st January is also when our Declaration of Independence was issued – hence why that’s the date chosen.
 The ‘Republic of Ireland’ is the name of a soccer team. Ireland is the name of this entire land. ‘Ireland’ did not suddenly start in 1921. OUR country was partitioned against the wishes of its people. To then pretend that that partition constitutes ‘Independence’ is utterly hideous.
 The real Irish live in the occupied 6Co’s and overseas unlike brain washed fools living  in 26Co’ who stupidly welcome Muslim hordes who will implement Sharia law when they gain political power in very near future.
 your a servent of the queen ireland the 26 counties is independent whether you like it or not :)
 I’m from the 26 counties,explain to me how I’m not “real Irish”?
We have less bank holidays than most European countries fact .Why not make it bank holiday.
 we don’t really though because most European countries’ bank holidays fall on fixed dates, not first Monday of this or that. They lose bank holidays if they fall on a weekend unlike Ireland where we get every bank holiday every year.
So we didn’t lose independence a decade ago?Hmmm…
 No. Pick up a history book.
 No we didn’t lose it a decade ago. For those unaware, we haven’t yet won it. Ireland has 32 counties. Not 26.
 northern Ireland has 6 counties the republic has 26
 Ireland has 32 counties.
 County Dublin was divided into three counties and a city as long as the 1980s. So you can’t count and you’re a…
Will we ever grow a set
Go for mid July for maximum chance of warmth..Whats a notable day in mid July in Ireland when people march about to music.??(answer not audible)..oh well .. January it is then…
Haha a complete joke when 6 counties aren’t included! leave it off lads
July is bare on the bank holiday front, in the Republic at least.Why not celebrate Ireland’s Independence Day on the First Monday of that month for the future?Setting a summer date for this celebration would be very considerate for working folks unable, for various reasons, to avail of longer summer holiday breaks.
 Why not in July? Because Ireland does not yet have Imdepemdence so having an ‘Independence Day’ in July (or any other month) while we are still partitioned is the height of madness, perhaps.
‘Independence’???Serfs to our EU overlords more like.Ireland had more independence when we were under Brit rule.What a joke.
 More boring anonymous troll rubbish. Can you not find another hobby?
 Yes the freedom to live and die in poverty. The EU has done more for Ireland in the last 40yrs than the previous 100yrs of union with Britain or the 800yrs of occupation overall.
 Good man ‘Danny’, from your anonymous twitter account……
 Waiting for you to produce statistics on that. Quite apart from the EU being massively funded by the UK as well.
Might want to wait until film independence is achieved there boss
 full even
 I thought you were lauding the idea of an indigenous  standalone film industry there for a minute as opposed to one that does subcontracting for Hollywood etc. Nearly gave it a thumbs up!
The obvious day would be 12 June (Houghton’s day) but that may conflict with exams.
Pointless without a day off!
According to some, Ireland can’t have an Independence Day until Robert Emmet’s epitaph is finally written. In the meantime, I suggest that we move St. Patrick’s Day to 17th May when sunshine and moderate temperatures are more likely to smile on public celebrations.
IF we are to have it I think it should be held on 1st of april because
Make it the first Monday in july, come on you know it makes independent sense.
? we’re are not independent, we are dependent on the EU
I’ll never accept independence day in this country until the north and south are unified.
July lads July. Need it in summer not bloody January
Ireland is still under Vatican rule but Vatican rule is gradually diminishing. Until Vatican rule and hegemony is ended, Ireland is not yet free and independent.
FFS make it in the summer
Another excuse for a national piss up. The Drinks Federation must be lobbying for this one
 How could it be a p1ss up when everyone is in work?
Independence of what, rediculous idea.
All ireland hurling final should be a national holiday,hurling is our national sport,,we should be all off work on the monday
Remember Arthur’s day
 No. It was a good one.
If it means a day off I’m all for it.
Don’t really care unless I get a day off let’s be honest
Seems pointless because people won’t treat it any different to any other day if it’s not a day off work.
But then a gov that’s desperately trying to improve their own popularity and fool people into thinking the country is booming will entertain the idea.
How about independace month ?
This is celebrated every year . Billy McGuire turns the seal at this event to keep our sovereignty alive . 2 years ago the seal was turned at the mansion steps as refusal to entrance to the mansion house . Our sovereignty is our land our assets etc .  This is celebrated every year but people should be told why it’s done ✅We only have a provisional government in place and for Ireland
January 21 is not our independence day. It’s April 26.
 April 26th is not our Independence Day. We are not yet Independent.
Free State Government having Independence Day would make Orangemen very happy.
“We are not yet independent as long as the six counties etc etc.” Yes we are! I understand the nationalists need to feel included in the whole island but really, saying we’re not independent because of partition is ridiculous! Anyway, imo, St. Patricks day is enough already!
 Saying we are independent while the country is divided and partly under foreign rule is what is ridiculous, you absolute halfwit.
 oh look, an ad hom. Classy. The Republic of Ireland is an independent country, it ain’t rocket science! You don’t get to impose your narrative.
 The ‘Republic of Ireland’ is the name of a soccer team. It is not the name of the 26 county banana republic, according to it’s own ‘constitution’. It is also not a ‘narrative’ to state that Ireland did not suddenly come into existence in 1921. Our country being partitioned is not ‘independence’ by any twisted stretch of the imagination.
 Paper will not refuse ink. What name anything has is decided by consensus and Republic of Ireland is the consensus.
No, if it costs us
What’s the odds though that the schools will close, and the poor old teachers will get yet another day off.
Typical of the government Ind day what about the homeless
The presidents speech from the movie independence day is 67 characters too long boo-urns
 edit it into txt speak
Maybe you want to put that on hold…until Irexit!
Independence day = Retailers & Publicans licking their lips
This is something Ive actually been wondering and questioning about for a while: why do the large percentage of people in this country acknowledge the US Independence Day and yet couldnt even tell you when the Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed?Shops, pubs and TV run different promotions or events (in varying size) for July 4th yet we have never had something of our own.I always take off Dec 6th as a ‘personal holiday’ but we should definitely have a Public Holiday of our own.
 The thing is…the day the treaty was signed was not the day Ireland won independence. It is the day the partition of our country was forced upon us against our wishes. We have not yet won Independence. We have 32 counties, not 26. Please don’t insult the Irish citizens of the 6 counties by suggesting Ireland has won Independence while we here remain stuck under british rule against our own wishes and against the wishes of the majority of the people in Ireland.
 why do ya bother trying to explain things to west brit trolls on here,,this whole thing has been invented by fg to wind people up,,you are wasting your breath
 Great Norman surname there Declan. That makes you a West Brit too in my book. You oppressed me in 1169.
Wait for unification of Ireland before declaring Independence..
I think we see enough fireworks in these comments sections alone, we don’t need a special day for them.
Silly me, I thought today was April 17 , not the first ! Further, I have just looked skywards and saw lots of pigs and kites flying !
Makes me frigging lath this mupet goverment,,talking crap about independence day,,don’t they realise our independents was given to the Troika,,shame on them shame on placing so many people in yrs of hardship no wounder we are the lathing stock of,,Europe and all and sundry looking in.
Do the Shit Feiners on here just read the Journal to get annoyed and start spouting their chucky our law nonsense?There is virtually zero support for their views.
Always wise to reject anything put forward by Fianna FAIL. It would just be hijacked by our balaclava loving idiots anyway. Well, after they split first over recognising it. As the Parish Priest in Toomevara once said on the day of the last judgement itself some people here wearing greenshirts would refuse to recognise the court!
Yes Ireland should certainly have its own Independance Day. It should be celebrated by everyone. It should be held in summertime on the longest day of the year. Of course it should be a bank holiday.
Bad idea, wrong date, an Irish version of Nigel Farage suggesting the date of the Brexit referendum result as the UK’s independence day. Fun fact the actual date of S. Irish independence is 7th March 1922. Born before that date and you can claim full British citizenship.
Marking the 12th in July would be a way to reach out to Unionism. Parliament Day sounds good.
Why are people suggesting that varadkar shouldn’t meet with Trump? Regardless of your political affiliation or opinion on trump, maintaining good relations with America is in the best interest of the country.
 Stop talking sense Daniel. It’s not appreciated on these forums.
 True Dan, but Dump is such an c***t, it could be worth making an exception for him. How satisfying to tell him to shove it.
 absolutely right. Not meeting the president of America should never be an option.
Let’s hope Leo gets a date for the Presidential visit….This year perhaps……Seeing the mayor of London says Trump is not welcome we can get one up on the Brits…..
 Mayor of London didn’t say he wasn’t welcome. He said he isn’t deserving of a state visit and highlighted Londoners will protest his visit. Trump cancelled a visit to open the US Embassy in London himself due to some illogical nonsense that Obama sold the Mayfair Embassy which was actually sold by Bush.  Ireland have not invited Trump over on a state visit and it’s bizzare that May did weeks after he became president
What socks will he wear?! The suspense is killing me!
 __ After giving it several days of serious thought, I’ve concluded that at least one of them might have a bit of green in it.

President Trump may one day receive the Noble Peace prize for his contributions World Peace, all going well, all that aside hope Varadkar minds his p’s and q’s!…

There must be an entire room in the White House filled full of crystal bowls that once had Shamrock in them.
 that tradition is cringworthy.
 The annually gifted bowls of shamrock are planted in the White House’s gardens and nurtered until they die off. That is why it is an Annual ‘refreshing’ Gift by every Taoiseach of our “great” country of Ireland to the “great” country that is America.
 Is the shamrock not immediately destroyed by the secret service on health grounds?
 Yup
We are one of a few nations in the world that has a ticket to the White House every year. We need to make sure that continues. Leo needs to play the game.
More embarrassing every year.
And Ireland pays for everything you do, leo, even the millions you’re spending on trying to create your fake and bloated image!
Are these jollys to America still necessary? Leo going over to kiss their arses .Such a massive waste of tax payers money.
 Jesus, I was just eating a packet of crisps.
 150,000 direct FDI jobs. Another 100,000 indirect. No other country gets guaranteed White House access every year. Was in US for Paddy’s in 2016 – Ireland gets blanket coverage on all stations for the two days. It literally is the only thing to put us on the map.And then you have the utter, utter idiocy of people back here complaining about access and coverage money could never, ever buy.This is why it is so difficult to ever take lefty commenters on here seriously.They would actively damage Ireland’s interests.
 the 0.05% corporation tax is what has them here …Lefty commentators damage our interests .. your gas. FFG bankrupt us multiple times and it’s the lefties who damage OUR interests.
 we call them Taytos.
 With regards to wasting tax payer’s money I would certainly put the welfare system above diplomatic visits to America.
 Most folk wouldn’t. Thank god.
 Bull
 Brilliant argument there Michael.Completely turned me around on this issue.You’re clearly a very smart man.
Ireland, as distinct from her people, is nothing to me; and the man who is bubbling over with love and enthusiasm for “Ireland,” and can yet pass unmoved through our streets and witness all the wrong and the suffering, shame and degradation wrought upon the people of Ireland-yea, wrought by Irishmen upon Irish men and women, without burning to end it, is, in my opinion, a fraud and a liar in his heart, no matter how he loves that combination of chemical elements he is pleased to call Ireland.James Connolly
:V̶a̶r̶a̶d̶k̶a̶r̶ Leo likely to indulge Pence and Ryan with talk of Irish roots.
 Could it not be suggested that the meeting between the orange one and the soup bowl haircut one have their pow wow in Ireland, at least it would be held in a semi neutral country.
 you said semi..
Google tells me that Paul Ryan is 48. His grandfather emigrated in 1851? How old was he when he sired Ryan’s da? 90?
 His great grandfather surely!
What about trumps hair roots
I might help pence with giving some extra irish flavour at the end of the night, once I’m finished with him he be well rooted.
Ah ye fools, ye fools! – ye who are knocking “Socky’s” visit to America.This is Ireland’s time of the year on the world stage – in America, China, Australia, the UAE, even in Ireland and wherever or whatever yer having yerself there.This is when Ireland sends its “Very Important” Irish people all over the world to entice business into Ireland and to re-generate business and jobs in Ireland.The result of these trips by “Very Important” Irish people has brought the establishment of more companies and jobs in Ireland than the majority of “Unimportant” Irish people could generate by themselves.Because of these marketing trips by “Very Important” Irish people all over the world around St Patrick’s Day, we have, today in Ireland, the European Headquarter Offices, factories, pharmaceutical and financial businesses of many International companies.Loads of business-orientated Irish-Americans can’t get tickets to attend the dinner that any American President holds for any Taoiseach of the Republic of Ireland every St Patrick’s Day occasion. Attending that dinner is the greatest opportunity for any business man or woman to “network” with the “Very Important” Irish people and establish or spread their business in Ireland or Europe.“Socky’s” – and other “Very Important” peoples’ trips to the USA and elsewhere around our world – is never a junket trip. It’s strictly business – for jobs in Ireland.Ask the “Really Very Important” Irish people who have jobs in Ireland because of our St Patrick’s blessings of idiotically called “junket-trips”.
Just waiting for what embarrassing moment of f up Trump will say or do this week..just waiting..
This country is up shit creek without a paddleThis junket is a string of junkets to sell ireland to americansPerhaps they arent working and he should maybe try NOT going
 and this folks is an example of somebody who just doesn’t get the value of access to the world’s most powerful leader and the world’s biggest economy for one special day each year to sell our wares!
 Ireland is already sold -
A smarm offensive.
If he Carrie’s ireland with him why does he refuse to wear a tricolor pin on his suit or even an easter Lily what a hypocrite
 Is there a law that states we have to wear a tricolour or lily??
 because he’s American so wears the us flag pin?
quite disgraceful and disgusting Leo of all people indulging these odious figures, Pence still believes in crazy unproven therapy that can cure gay people. Trump is just plain deranged and is intent of deporting as many undocumented as possible. There are those who will say not making government representatives for St. Patrick’s will make things worse? I’d love to how could it any worse. American companies will commence their exit from Ireland in the coming years anyway. It’s a pity Ireland’s government could not have showed some courage and said “enough” and boycotted Trump & Co this year
Leo don’t forget to show Trump your the star & stripes socks. Trump is easy to impress and will love them. Suggest you don’t mention anything about his hair he can be very touchy about that matter.
God speed.
We give them shamrock, they tell us how the irish but America and 40 million have irish blood, but we can Fcuk off if we’re looking for help for the undocumented irish, stop, it’s pathetic.
You’d have thought the government should “give back” to the North Inner City. Instead of ignoring it for decades.
 “A number are offering internships and roles in the company and it is not just working in the post room, it is positions in good jobs with prospects. And as well, they are offering funds for sales training to allow some young people to experience time with sales training as part of a youth diversion programme,” he said,”I didn’t read anything there that suggested people getting paid.
 FG in negelted areas like Noel Rock are only there on Labour transfers and are going to be toast when FF maul Leo from the long grass after referendum and before October as they can’t give Leo a budget of tax cut giveaways to the privileged like IFSC and of course Apple’s and cos piss taking tax paid of less than 1% of the 12.5% rate.
 Jesus some people are never happy. All he said was that companies in the IFSC should help to boost employment in the immediate area behind them which is a deprived area of Dublin. A good common sense suggestion. Cue the whingers and the whataboutery.
It’s the Governments duty, to give back to the North inner city,Just typical of the Government,Blame everyone else ,for their failure to provide the basic needs of the community.The company’s in the IFSC pay their rates and taxes,It’s the Government who spent them
Leo should have to spend a week or two living in the inner city and other neglected areas and see is it easy. Leo wouldn’t even go sock shopping in the Henry St. area.
 about time the north inner city game back. 1000s of jobs were made availible to compete for. New train station. Luas at your door syop. A 3rd level college. Any ever walk by the boxing club at night? See how long you last, theres a reason why squad cars park in the area. The area needs to help itself first.
 thats on the Northside      no one shops  there.
 agreed. I’ve had a long relationship with the area. Some people are just determined to destroy, steal, assault… my patience ran out years ago. ‘Socially Deprived’ my ar5e
 did you vote for them? Not having a go, but people vote for them or FF and seem to expect change.
 spot on.
 I live in the area – no idea what you are talking about! Walk around day and night and never a problem
The NCI college has been in the area for over 15 years and has excellent access programs that many locals have availed of to get good jobs. Courses are run in the evenings too, you don’t have to be a full time student. But if some other locals drop out of school early and have no interest why lay a guilt trip on the businesses, people have to help themselves too
There’s no incentives to get ahead and make something of themselves. They are in a classic welfare trap…welfare, including the free house, is far too high relative to a lower paid job. Long term welfare needs to be cut, and cut substantially.
 i bet you  are a  great  bundle of fun.
 The corporate endless welfare continues with F all tax and tax avoidance facilitated by our state. Poverty paying employers get FIS welfare. Legal eagles get endless welfare through legal aid. Doctors get paid for every med and GP cardholder even if they never visit doc & so more welfare for the better off.  No one gets dole for a few months max without being forced on to some full time schemes ran by UK companies who are (friendly with the Tories and now FG)These activation companies get paid everytime(even if candidates repeated over and over with little success rate of job searching company) someone is forced on to them and they have a only 18% success rate of getting people into full time jobs.
Give back what to the North inner city? what has the North inner city ever done for anyone? They seem to have an inflated sense of their contribution to society.How about elements of the North inner city quit the criminality and anti-social behaviour.
People hand over half their wages for the luxury of long commutes and these guys live smack in the middle of the city centre in subbed accommodation. That’s messed up.
 Corporate welfare multiple times more
 Dowling could refer to the subsidised accommodation and grants given to TCD. The well funded ghetto in the South inner city.
No they have a duty to give employment to suitable qualified candidates!!! Companies do not owe locals anything…it is up to parents to inspire their kids that they are good enough to go on to further education (such as national college of ireland on their doorstep, tcd over the river, st pats a half hour walk, dcu a bus ride away etc!) get qualifications and work hard.
 What has TCD ever given back to the community? TCD have been supported by the people of Ireland for generations, and have cost the taxpayers millions more than the north inner city ever did, without producing a scholar, never mind a product worth mentioning.
 Did you or somebody close to you lose out on a place in TCD by a few points??? That chip on your shoulder with TCD seems awfully large…
 Is it yourself, the obsequious enquirer representing its little fraternity? Do tell me how the FMG debate is going at the students union. You are such a brave bunch of laddies. How about making a press statement? Ha ha ha.
 While we are on the subject of FGM, you may by now, (as a student at TCD), have become familiar with the term FMGM. Feeble Male Genital Mutilation. It is widely practiced in Hindu, Buddhist, and Muslim cultures. A press release on the subject, in addition to an announcement on TCDs professed stance on the subject of FGM would be most welcome and no doubt educational.
Any corp going to pay more than 1% Leo?
They have a duty, so why is their tax rate at almost zero! I fear Leo is just exploiting these people.
The best option is to break these neighborhoods apart as they created these people and protect them. Yes there are decent people there but ultimately you can’t remove the rot surgically
A bad week for Leo and the gov, their multi million euro spin unit were found out for paying the media to produce positive gov biased news stories, and a few days later, it’s a photo opp with disadvantaged people from the north inner city. What are we supposed to think this is?
Yeah right.  More chance of finna ghoul and finna fail giving us those golden unicorns we were all promised in the last election.  International capital would be more interested in havning north inner city Dubliners removed to the sticks to accommodate their legions of imported workers. Minister is living in la la land
 My favorite part was when you said Fine Ghoul and Fianna Fáil. That was tremendous banter, it really was!
 cheers mate.  Probably like a lot of people i don’t hold much hope in these legacy parties.
Is it just me or is what Leo is saying is absolute garbage. Companies located in the IFSC do give back in many ways, they pay their taxes and provide employment. Also, many companies offer internships to students which provide them with experience and in some cases a job after college. The government should “give back” in some form to communities that are underprivileged.
It’s more than giving back, it’s about being socially aware, multi million deals every minute and they run to ignore the socially deprived out their windows, at least there high enough to look down on them
I don’t think Joseph Goebbels could do a better job than Leo’s propaganda machine.
What do the people in the inner city need ?
 About 2.5 megatons
I commute myself so I know all about it. They are on the doorstep of the IFSC. It just seems bizarre that thetes no engagement.
 its a culture of poor me and entitlement of inner city for generations
Clickbait, Daffy Duck and Violin Varadkar talking out of both sides of their faces. If this “development” plan was a pile of sticks you couldn’t make a match to light a fire. Lip service and no substance. Neglect in the north inner city has been ongoing for over 40 years, how many years have FFG been in power, all of them besides the debacle of PDs and FF. There is no democracy in the dail, how is that FFG can be in opposition/power at the same time. Madness
We should deport all of them far far away so they can fight and kill each other away from the rest of us.
 my mother  nursed  there in the 40s  guess nothing has changed..
Sounds like passing the buck to me. It’s the job of local and central government to “give back” companies are not responsible for regenerating the area the set up HQ in.
Jonathan Corrie died feet from Dáil Éireann, some gumption from the Fine Gael hypocrites.
Why don’t FG make it mandatory for IFSC companies to have quota system to employ some local people. Then at least they can be seen to be including them instead of just having a talking shop about it.
 so not only do they get free accom in the CC, businesses should be under some sort if ob to emply them. Sounds fair.
 I have to disagree, companies should not be forced to employ people from the local area. Local people can of course apply as long as the education and relevant experience is met
 what about a young person up the road in Drumcondra for example? Parents who sacrificed so their child could go to college to get qualifications to be told sorry but your not from a “deprived area” so I’m giving it to this lad living behind ifsc who has no qualification!!
No that’s pie in the sky Erica, to be setting such quotas. We live in a meritocracy and employers should be free to hire whom they wish, within own set criteria. Whoever pays the piper calls the tune!But what should be considered is for local IFSC firms to have open days, maybe once a year, whereby local kids..and adults…are invited to visit a boardroom or canteen and hear from Management what goes on in a firm, and how a youngster might pursue a career in sector in question. Such could be very inspiring  to some young ears. Simple Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives wouldn’t break the bank.
As long as someone else pays and someone else is to blame, Socky’s spin department never misses a photo opportunity to self congratulate and pontificate.
Look at the head of Paschal as he gazes adoringly at Socky. It’s akin to the way a dog looks at it’s master.
Productive suggestion @Rory J Leonard.
Obama is cooler than any of us can ever hope to be
Don’t forget about all those kids Obama bombed while in office.Enda might be a wet blanket but at least he doesn’t have wiping out entire families on his conscience.
I wish Enda Kenny well. He wasn’t perfect, but he put in a massive effort and left our country in a better state.It is easy to denigrate, criticise, and belittle others. It is much harder to fix problems than offer opinions.Happy Christmas.
 Hi Paul what did Kenny government do or Kenny himself do to turn things around?
 Are we now as a country , heavily in debt , a debt we will probably never escape from unless we renege on it .This is a burden that future generations will hold , was there no other way ?We have been sold down the river , by the likes of weak minded people like Enda .
 So of the 214 billion debt and remembering that most of Anglo debt has yet to be added – what would a strong minded leader done differently?
 Lavbeer , I was away at the time , so am not up with the numbers , did we have a 214 billion debt to start with , or did Ireland end up with that .I’d love to know how this number was arrived at , it’s a lot of houses , especially when they were sold off for a lot less than this amount .
 what did you do Declan? No need to belittle Kenny just because you can’t comprehend what the government does,
 ah, the old “you were never in that position, belittleing the opinion” argument! I’d say he filled a space for a few years, when there were no other takers. Our politicians are a poor bunch in general anyways going by recent history, ie: state bankrupcy, part of the PIIGS in the EU, imf bailout, quadrupling the national debt.
 he executed the FF/troika programme, making amendments to dump the burden more on those with the least. He introduced a series of regressive budgets meanwhile denigrating two pint man and paddy…great man.
 yeah he was really super. Great man for Germany & France – useless on health, the homeless crisis, Garda corruption etc. Feathered his nest brilliantly. A gombeen politician for gombeen people.
 Like I said , I’d love to hear about it .
 u must’ve been asleep for the past 7 years
 he’s a second rate teacher and a good for nothing pension collector. The back of my hand to him.
 your a disgrace to humanity.
 They have concrete bollards at the top of Grafton st , is that enough .
  Hi Shawn I worked my arse off and paid my taxes that is what I did. I didn’t be little Enda but I did genuinely ask what did the man do to turn things around ?
 a legend in his own mind
 shinner ya ?
 our national debt went up about 40 billion (net) from saving the banks. Thats about half of the deposit liabilities of one of our banks. Genuine question, what if we let any one of them fail? Its shite we had to burden the cost but it was the least worst scenario
 we could have let Anglo collapse without any consequence to the taxpayer. That was the largest part of the bailout, 30$billion or so.
A lot of messages from those who have no clue what Enda did to those with nothing. Nothing to be proud of Enda as you collect your unearned pension……
 EXACTLY!!
Kenny sacrificed the working classes,the vulnerable in society,to protect bankers,corporations etc.hope to never see the likes of him again.
 No wonder we only have 60 army rangers left , imagine being given the job of protecting that flake .
 we have leo, he is even worse
Anybody congratulating kenny obviously has no clue about irish politics. To name just a few scandals unded his watch…record numbers of homeless and patients on trollies, record waiting lists in hospitals and garda whistleblower scandal. Then theres the apple tax saga and paying off non protected bond holders and allowing our coastal waters to be raped of all natural resources whilst he retires with x million in a golden handshake and how many pensions is it??
Ahh bless, his minions sent in sycophantic thank you notes
 Wait till Adams steps down – even Bertie went in 6 weeks – expect to see much the same stuff.
Someone please tell me this is a windup.
 it’s a windup
You cant keep everyone happy as Taoiseach . I am no Kenny fan however he was one of our better leaders . Very low bar to be one of our better Leaders.
 better then Bertie  ,Cowen,Haughey,?
Can everyone remember what enda kenny was faced with when he came to office. Record unemployment and the countrys markets at junk bond status. He left us in a far better position than he found us
 No he left some people in a far better position, the majority were inflicted with more hardship which a lot of people are still suffering under Leo. He was an out and out chancer .
 he did f**k you numpty. The people of Ireland did all the heavy lifting – internationally things turned around for some & Kenny just held on – placating his paymasters until he was done. An abject failure of a man & a politician but clowns such as yourself just blow hot air – no substance to your comment at all. Fact.
No substance to your comment either you d**khead. Put your real name on there. What was the unemployment level when he got in and when he left?
 This is my real name , Ken Hayden .How much debt is this country saddled with ?Please tell me , how much money do we owe to the troika .Come on , tell me .
 homelessness
 he tied a mountain of debt around the necks of our children and grandchildren. Himself and old baldy. They will curse him.Never took a hard decision in his life and retired an abject failure on multiple pensions.
“My seven year old daughter shed a tear”…..At Enda leaving….Tell her to cop onto herself…Santa’s coming. Jesus.
And I shed tears of joy when you were gone..
I lost all respect for kenny when he let that little french upstart pat him on the head like a puppy dog ,i would have planted him one there and then and took the consequences ,he never had balls just like the two that fought to replace him .
And I thought Leo’s pr machine was solely for his own ego.
 So true it don’t matter who’s in power or how good they are people will still ridicule them.
So even with an article on Enda , you couldn’t leave Trump out  .
8000 thousand children in emergency shelters , people struggling to survive pay rents , success ?
Useless’ as the saying goesThose who can’t do ‘ Teach
Vomit
even my 7 year old shed a tear ,ha ha ha ha,
The guy was totally out to lunch, having imaginary meetings and conversations with ministers and lads with a pint in each hand.Worst Taoiseach ever.
Thank goodness he’s gone; not that his follow-up is any better.  The States has their moron, we have ours.
Wasn’t our greatest Taoiseach but after Cowen anyone was an improvement. Much more of a manager than a leader but lead when he needed to and got the conditions right to get us out of the shitter. Ultimately we’re seeing the problems of a lost decade now though and how a medium sized city with no infrastructure and massive population growth can’t sustain itself in the boom if the infrastructure isn’t there. My Christmas wish to Leo is metro North, Dart Underground and expansion and regulations to say new developments must be high rise to curb the rental hell.
 the Metro north has been given the go ahead,Murphy has said higher buildings on the way ,as they delivered on full employment fast growth LUAS  north side and joined up ,childrens hospital ,maternity hospital on the way,we are entering a golden era for Ireland if we don’t screw it up ,like putting FF/SF into power and watch it all go down the toilet bowl
Plenty of trolls on this as per usual…Honestly, I liked Enda… not here for a political debate or to justify my position.. I’m not affiliated to any political party but I just liked the guy.. he wasn’t perfect but he dedicated his life to public work which isn’t easy… yes he was paid for it but it is a hard job for which he was elected… yes he messed up numerous times but I get the feeling that his intentions were always good! I just liked himAs for the trolls, it’s easy to throw barbs from behind a keyboard.. he is at the end of the day an Irish citizen like everyone else, no need to make it personal
No fan of F.G. or F.F. when Kenny became Taoiseach with the support of the so called Labour party the writing was on the wall for the workers and ordinary Irish people. F.F.facilitated the gangesterism of the banks and developers. Kenny supported by so called Labour party endorsed their gangesterism through austerity measures,  cut backs to social services, while at the same time Noonan,  Nama sold this country to vulture fund companies. Kenny,s legacy… thousands homeless, Thousands in Hotel and B&B.s. accommodation , a crumbling health service scandal after scandal. His successor no better. Ironically the party that brought this country to it’s knees now keep the Thathreite Blueshirts in power. That’s Kennys legacy.
No one is totally useless, he can always be used as a horrible example.
Ruined the country and rode off into the sunset with his huge pensions just like the many parasitic leeches before him.
A brilliant Taoiseach, the best we’ve had in the last 20 years. Reduced national debt, unemployment from 14.7% to near full, increased business and credit ratings, public expenditure, increased exports leading to an export lead economy. The naysayers, begruders and ignorant will sit in their chairs and type how he did nothing only look after himself. To them I wish a happy Christmas and an enlightening new year
The English royal is referred to by his title, the President of the United States is not. There endeth my reading of the article, I hope it was a good one.
 Very sensitive.
 to be fair we all know who they mean when they say Trump, not sure saying Charles would be as obvious to people.
 snowflake
 Is that Basturd?
Leo has a lot to be grateful to Trump for, Trump showing him the way on using tweets for news deflection and media manipulation.
 but he’s not fooling you is he Adrian?!
 absolutely not :)
All sh!te gifts, no doubt they all ended up in the dumpster the second Leo’s back was turned
Mayo jersey was only €43.05. Official kit jerseys should be about €65 each. There’s a tribunal in that.
 cost price from the kit supplier I’d imagine.
Socks and jocks
We must be pretty stingy with the State’s gifts!
Gifts are from the Irish nation
That pair aren’t even on my gift list.
Bozo trump should not get anything fom us
Leo just wanted to rip the socks&jocks  off Justin!!!
So no Russian ties then lol.
Did he just wake up suddenly in the middle of the night and think about this? “Wait a minute, did I say Margaret Hassan was a Muslim?!”
 In the course of writing memoires most politicians use the official parliamentary records, speeches, contemporaneous media and their personal & political diaries for reference.   He’s obviously writing about the changing political scene and Islamic terror affecting Irish citizens.RIP Ms Hassan.
Seems a bit strange to be correcting it now, still though fair enough!
 Ex professional liar makes a statement about the truth. You couldnt make it up
Any other lies he told about McCabe, what he knew and when it knew it re Tusla spent forty years in the Dail and the most he done was promote his girlfriend Miss Piggy to cabinet oh and lie a Lot.
Good to know our former leader only fxxkxd up once
  a day
Well that’s one lie he has admitted to when will he come clean on all the rest?
How many more statements will he have to correct
Who knows what else a guilty conscience will throw up. A political shrimp.
Probably the greatest conman ever to doss in the Dail, and thats saying something considering the stiff competition he was up against.
Pity he can’t undo his whole political career
What did he originally say that Ms Hassan had converted?  What was the factual basis for the original assertion. He has not explained how and why he got it so wrong.
It is strange that no context is given.It seems like a very odd lie to make up, especially when the tribute was positive and commemorative.Presumably given incorrect information?
 The Irish Times, Guardian and maybe the Independent all published that claim.
So endais still a TD …turning up is optional is it?
I don’t want to see this idiot’s face anymore.
More fool you, did you see his pension?
@blackjack You dont have to..he has not been in The Dail, up to yesterday at least on any of the 70 days it has sat since he retired as Taoiseach…hes still a TD
 Totally incorrect.. but don’t let that get in the way of your narrative.
 you must mean his pensions – TD, Minister, Teachers full pension even though he did not work as a teacher in forty years.
Enda. How dare you insult a person by assuming – quite likely because of her married name – that she had converted to Islam. You insulted her memory but also that if her family and wide circle of friends who adored her. Thirteen years to give an apology. Go away.
I wonder were they trying to pretend she was a Muslim at the time to spare her life? I remember the government issuing an Irish passport to Kenneth Bigley at the time in an effort to save his life.
A blue shirt playing for Mayo. Now there’s a thought . Not another own goal I hope .
 Sure if he doesn’t win a seat he can keep trying at every election thereafter, just like the nearly men of his county. Mayor have given us the Flynn’s and Enda. Please Mayo don’t vote FG .
 didn’t he fix the roaaads?
All prospective candidates should be a Councillor first to gain experience
 why?
 People who actually work in and for the local community must be disgusted by such an offer. This makes a mockery of the vocation usually involved in local representation.
 “vocation” lol
 You might laugh, but the level of commitment required to be well regarded and well known in the local community is not to be sneezed at. Why don’t you give it a go yourself.?
 Good man councillor ryan!
 I’d argue balancing inter county football and a job is a tougher gig than being a TD. He’ll have my vote. Absolute gent
 Did you read any of the genuine concerns raised in the above comments? Would you not want to at least hear what he can bring to the table? This is why we end up with the same f@cking clowns!!!!!!
Fine Gael goes for the local celebrity option again…
 Your surprised??
 absolutely not. We’ve had the same approach here in Louth… Losing the Leinster final in 2011 was the best thing to ever happen sex Ed and abortion expert Peter Fitzpatrick.
Another substitute appearance
The good old gravy train, who wouldn’t want to jump onboard.
From working in a pharma factory to the dail… bit of a change and a higher salary and other perks…..
Kenneth egan.
The Irish political system is a fcekin joke .whats next Conor mcgregor standing for people before profit
 If the party nominate him and he gets elected what’s the joke. If he runs a good campaign and is voted in he deserves to be there that’s the way it works….
 straight from a  GAA career into the DAIL , that’s the joke Padraic you’re obviously a blue shirt with tunnel vision
 Naw – Halawa for Taoiseach. Comes from good Irish stock. Will get Beef contracts with Egypt. Oh wait?
 actually would you believe I’m a Fine Fail supporter and your the first person to tell me I have tunnel vision. If he gets nominated and wins the election he has the right to represent don’t see what’s wrong with that. Your just like every other idiot on here criticising everything in the news but never really doing anything to influence change.
 I thought, he’d be more SF and would suit their politics?
Nobody could replace enda Kenny.Unless its kim jong, sorry maybe that’s a little harsh.Sorry kim, your a murderer, enda prefered to toss them out on the streets and let mother nature do its worst, slowly and painfully.
Ah here…
The blue shirts put a nail in the coffin of Dillon’s sporting ambitions. My expectation is that the Blueshirts will now do likewise to his political ambitions.
Best of luck Alan, a worthy candidate.
 why?
 What qualifications does he have? What will he bring to the party. Or is it the usual ‘Footballer, well known’ qualification with no substance?
Nothing but good folk came out of mayo.Now where’s me GPS
Parish pump politics at its worst, he has no experience and an ex GAA man. Lets elect him, for his footballing skills and ability to kick cans down a road.
I saw this on twitter earlier and I thought it was a Waterford whispers article
He will have to be good at telling lies if he wants to be a FG TD or FF TD sure there all the  same
Fair play to you Dillo.If you do decide to run then the best of luck to you and fu#k the begrudgers.As for All the knockers,keep your unwanted opinions to yourselves.Ye know fu#k all about the lad so keep the cheap shots to yourselves.
 I know he wants to support a repulsive party so f*ck you and him-that’s my opinion, suck it up!
And we wonder why this sh#$hole is f#$@ed
“It is great to see new people join us in Fine Gael”. The bould Ring already putting Dillon down. What? Someone new suddenly gets on the ticket? What about the stalwarts?On another note, I see Lisa McDonald in Wexford has election size posters out in abundance advertising some meeting or other she’s having. Nice woman, nice family, but as she’s FF, no thanks.
This is everything that’s wrong with Irish politics.
A big opportunity to get his snout in the trough.
Another reason to hate bogball!
Mario rosenstock hasn’t a patch on Oliver CallanHe is just brilliant..
 he’s better at impersonations, he’s just not funny….. at all
He’ll always be a poor man’s Mario Rosenstock.
 He is definitely not poor
 I’d say the reverse is true Rosenstock is a clown whereas Callan is a satirist in the mould of Spitting Image… both have great impressions whereas Callan makes a political point whereas Rosenstock does jokes – whichever you prefer i guess.
 He works for RTE…There’s no way he’s poor
 spot on Gabby. Callan is brilliant
 well said
 back to bed fake account frank,
I think he’s a great impressionist, satirical and funny as well. Mario, sorry no, not a patch.
His Baron Adams speaking Irish is priceless.
 That sounds like great craic. Have you got a link to it?
 SF censorship dept is up early eh Brendan?
 Get out the wrong side of the cot this morning Gabby?
 Literally every week, check out the podcast. Its hilarious.PS I dont post links. Lots of good republican around, one can never be too careful, you know how it is shinnerbot :)
 So, no link.
 podcast on rte website, their app, and im sure there is plenty on youtube too. Endless laughs. Hi Mary Lou ‘I’ll have chips with that’ is priceless.As i said i dont post links, to many unhinged ‘good republicans’ about and we all know their tendency for violence.
 I listen to his podcast and haven’t heard more than a couple of words of Irish at the start of a sketch. I’m sure you meant something more than that.Got a link?
 rte.ie
 LOL!Caught once again….
 rte.ie not working shinnerbot?It’s fun leading my little stalker around. Your obsession with me is very amusing indeed. Desperately running to twitter with every post :DIts like i occupy a permanent space in your brain PMSL
That clip is excellent, he got them spot on.As an aside, it’s refreshing to finally see somebody acting like the Taoiseach.
 It would be fun to see SF act like opposition but I suppose ye are too busy with the bullying?
 fantastic news form Leo regarding the freeloader, i am sure you are outraged?#FeelingGoodWithFineGael
 You appear to have poor old frank in a spin, he’s following you around the journal like a lost little puppy and its incredible entertaining ;-)
 Only until he’s banned again. Then he’ll be ack with another account that’s been automatically flagged and restricted by twitter.Hugely entertaining….
 I’m not going away you know LOL
Neither is twitters interest in you, or me pointing it out:)
 Is that all your mates in twitter again Brendan? PMSL
 what percentage of your day do you spend obsessing with me? Would you admit you have a crush?
It is hard to caricature those who are already walking/ talking caricatures.Leo is acting as Taoiseach.
 Well then he can add acting to his political prowess also. Is there anything he cant do?
 sort out the Irish economy, the health crisis, the homeless crisis, the corruption in the gardai, the cartel behaviour of the insurance industry and the complete disregard for society of the banks.
 yes, the real priority issues.
Its incredibly easy to impersonate Enda, just have a gombeen expression on your face and for Leo all you have to do is show off your socks in the most fascist way imaginable.
I was only listening to Callans Kicks last night and I thought it was brilliant. Great Impressionist and not afraid to make some important points. Thanks Journal for posting this.
His Marian is a masterpiece :-) Ryan T – very difficult because he doesn’t have strong vocal characteristics.
The Master
From the photo, it looks as though he’s currently perfecting his Louis C K routine.
Who cares . Both of those who he impersonate people are stremely annoying be they professional or otherwise
Fair play Leo, you can’t win sometimes! I think your doing a decent job so keep it up
 unemployment rate down to 6 % , there are 90,000 Indian immigrants in the USA with PhDs, many in high tech companies,so he’s going to garner a lot of interest, anyway out there working for the country
 Unemployment down to 6% ,don’t tell the shinners or looney left that ,there are 90,000 Indian immigrants in the USA with Phd’s many in high tech jobs,he will garner great interest,anyway he’s out there working for the country
 sorry posted from two different devices first did not seem to work ,it did
 Agreed Leo is doing a decent job, but must keep the natives happy too and not let the others walk all over us.
 that’s ok. reading it twice makes you sound twice as naive
 are you the dude thatb called the people of Castlebar dopes in a post below
 why on earth would the “looney left” care about that? It’s the alt-right that has a problem with foreigners!!! The “looney left” would want equality for all and welcome all. You really are confused.
 yep. Why?
It’s all about Leo
Irish people are being left behind, these tech jobs import new people from abroad to fill them leaving the irish worker the options to leave or stay here homeless and unemployed.
Any chance of some evidence to support that BS?
 Naturally some do come from elsewhere but plenty of Irish talent is employed by Facebook, Google etc
 it’s called localisation and translation and customer service that is best delivered by mother tongue speakers than some dope from Castlebar with leaving cert Hungarian or Uzbek. So bringing people in is very important.On average the biggest tech companies in the world will hire many 1000s of people every year. There is no credit for Leo in these announcements.Leo should’ve met with their accountants and discussed reparations for the many years of tax evasion carried out with his FG/F2F predecessors.But he’s rather the photo op. He’s a waster.
 A job is a job, but a genuine question what else do Irish  people get from working with  Google or Facebook.
  are there a lot of dopes in Castlebar ?
 ?
The tech companies provide training, further opportunity, good working environment, experience and lots of other benefits too.
 Any chance you could ask Apple for the money they owe us Leo, you know the money we need for our homeless and hospital crisis.
 its not exclusive to Castlebar. Mayo in general. Tipperary has its share. Roscommon is full of them apparently but I can’t vouch for that.
 It’s not all about Leo , it’s about jobs and the Athenry objectors should hang their heads in shame, they have denied the Country and it’s people jobs. There is no excuse for those that objected including the person who was not even from the locality, they should be ostracised and held as Traitors to the Nation.
 opportunites to upskill?
 you should move to north korea or some other place where such charges are brought against people for expressing their own views. and bring a load more off this island with you too.Maybe Apple will get over themselves and try to see the real value of such an investment in Ireland. and given their past indiscretions regarding how they have defrauding Irish people of billions in taxes then they might see it as some token.
Tax breaks. Its all about the tax breaks.
 Jobs. It’s all about jobs.
And what is wrong with that? Tax is a tool at the Irish government’s disposal which helps to attract companies to Ireland which employ people.
 are Irish companies permitted to change their operating name to renew their FDI benefits every 3 years? Some of these guys have been doing that for 40 years. Some if these ha e paid less than 200m on profits of 10bn in a single year but because of the architecture agreed with the IDA and Finance Department, they keep getting away with it.
 When you are younger it is all about getting work experience. But as you begin to age you need to have markers put down to secure your future. Do jobs with Apple, Google and Facebook honestly give the kind of security people in Ireland need these days.I am not pessimistic but with four of my kids working down under it would be nice to know the facts about the future here.
 ” Some if these ha e paid less than 200m on profits of 10bn in a single year”This is a flat out lie.Just a lie.From a liar.
 not a lie at allit depends on whether you consider their accounting practices to be correct or noton 22.6bn in revenues google declared 47m in taxes and 300m net income. it also claimed that it had 16.7bn in expenses. lol. for a couple of thousand people and estimated 750m in infrastructure.i understand how their model works. the expenses are costs to the parent company through local licensing deals that means they will always pay minimum tax here whilst they horde cash.i know two of the architects of the scheme. it was set up on the MSFT and Apple model of old.but of course you are welcome to believe what you like and let them and others defraud the irish people. knowing you then you probably think you know better. let me assure you that you do not.
 oh, by he way, your ignorant accusations don’t do your baseless argument any good. it just demonstrates the same void in your social skills as you have in your business and economics skills.
 You said they paid €200 million on €10 billion profit.That is a lie.Of course you could always provide a link that could prove me wrong.But you won’t. Because you can’t.Because it is a lie you made up.
 you’re right, i probably underestimated the profitsless than 200 million. i should have said less than 50mgood catchnow run along and continue to believe that these companies are here or the benefit of ireland.
Jesus you’d think he had a direct mandate from the people the way this ‘self-publicist’ is parading around the globe.. Happy Tax Haven Leo.
Yeah, what’s he at, the leader of our country meeting industry leaders and trying to get them to come to Ireland and create jobs. Where did he get the idea that was part of his job role
 when was the last time Ireland was led by someone with a ‘direct mandate from the people’?Charlie Haughey? Bertie? Trying to recall whose great legacy you are pining for…
 is he ever at home these days?
 not so much pining just looking for the missing link..
 last time I looked over 80% of the population doesn’t work for a multi national and their companies pay more tax and prop these bleeders up..
Facebook is now a political tool that people should stop using….Zuckerburg caught on a hot mic with Merkel shows Facebook for what it is.
Any sign of Apple paying up?We could try sort the housing crisis a bit and all them people suffering.
 how many jobs have you created lately?
Maybe if we told Apple to go elsewhere we could add a further 4.000 People to the dole queue and housing crisis not to mention the tax these people pay would no longer come into the system
Facebook have been building on a site near Clonee for the last 12 months so for Leo to make a claim on his trip that 100 jobs are confirmed they were always going to happenLeo all spin and no substance………….
 And more complete horse manure from people who hate to see jobs being created.Doesn’t fit their agenda.
 I’ve no problem with jobs being created but Leo is spinning as if it was his doing tw.t
There’s something a bit sad and pathetic about all this.. Reminds me of the old ‘man from del monte’ ads.. The peasants waiting for the overlord to say yes.. Corporations really are the new heads of state.. A new type of feudalism..
 aww sorry if you feel that way. The young people of Ireland won’t when they start their new jobs. What should we do? Act like a big roller on an island of 4-5 million people (there’s more people in London) or play to our advantages. That has worked extremely well for us. We punch way above our weight.
 but it’s all thanks to our links to Europe
If we believe thinks that these hard headed american business types soak up the Irish malarkey we’re in for  a shock. They are capable of being polite though when it suits then Regarding Athenry does he not not see he’s being punished for failing to deliver on the European  tax issue.We dont have any relationship with these people and will be dumped the instant it suits them Will he ever come to realise that his relationships with those people will be one of master and boy, or not atall. They would actually respect us more if we respected ourselves and enforced our Irish and European laws without fear or favour. Freedom is not free.
 political engagement is just a tiny but helpful portion of the process in FDI. Only the naive, inexperienced and misguided expect the planet to operate according to some socialist theorist’s textbook scribblings.
 What in the honour has socialist scribblings got to do with it. Oh maybe you mean Socialist Germany or the rest of the EU who don’t want us ot be playing games and allowing them to be defrauded of their proper tax returns. If you think always giving in, and constantly prosituting ourselves out is the way forward you’re the naive one
It would be interesting to know what percentage of employees of Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter and Linkein in Ireland are Irish.
 Irish were in the minority in Microsoft for a long time. not sure now but I can’t imagine it has change. Probably the same for other software companies. I am not sure about platform companies such as twitter and facebook.
 Interesting to know… might help us upskill as a nation.Important to remember all employees are Irish taxpayers and could up-stakes in the morning if we screw up our tax strategy.
 I totally disagree. Yes they need to recruit from abroad however this is usually to do with language capabilities.  The other thing working in the tech industry, a huge proportion if the jobs they create are in sales and customer service and don’t typically require master degrees in rocket science. That being said, I struggled to get into tech sales for years due to lack of experience in tech sales (the catch 22) so took the logical approach and started a degree in IT then approach the company I wanted to work for again after finishing my first year and successfully got a job.The bottom line Is, if you want something, work hard, look at the options available to help you get the job you want and go for it. I’m a firm believer you can do what you want providing you put the work in.For what it’s worth, I did this in my 30′s with 2 kids, mortgage etc, struggled for a couple of years financially but looking back it was well worth it.So to answer your comment about foreign workers coming in and taking up these jobs. The option is there to do something about it by educating yourself. Maybe learn a new language, whatever it takes and those jobs could be won by Irish workers. I know it’s not always easy but I think its always possible to improve even a little.
 Well stated Cathal !
Yay Go Verucca. I mean it’s not like there’s any crisis at home is there. Health system, Homeless,  Guarda,  Lack of property,  Tax Avoidance by individuals and Corporates, rural Crime and a pitched war between two major crime gangs.  Nope absolutely no reason he should be tooting around USA at all
Why isn’t he traveling to China, India or North Korea to get their companies to relocate to Ireland.  Maybe he can get Elon Musk to move there once the US government stops subsidizing his company.
 Gorry’s got NK sorted.
Have the three leprechauns been arrested yet.
Should be “docked our” not doctor. Docked our pay, docked our services, docked our standing in europe, docked our ability to cope with housing crisis…
 congratulations Enda. One of the great statesmen of our time. History will look kindly on his period in office. A giant of modern day Ireland. Well deserved recognition.
 agreed, i miss him,rescued the country
 “rescued the country”Nope. Rescued hoteliers, vulture funds and the rest of the 1%. ‘The country’ includes the people in it, such as the number of children in persistent poverty which doubled on his watch, and a homelessness issue which became a national emergency, also on his watch.And as for his pledge to ‘end the scandal of patients on trolleys’?Some rescue.
 ah the shinners ,where do i begin,let’s just say you wanted us to join with Greece and take on the world,yeah right,see the weekend poll ,stagnant going south dude remember when you were top ,most popular ,where did it all go wrong
 Ah yes, the weekend poll. Let’s see how it was reported on other news outletsirishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/no-budget-bounce-as-fine-gael-and-fianna-fail-slip-in-opinion-polls-810851.html“No ‘budget bounce’ as Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil slip in opinion polls”independent.ie/irish-news/news/no-poll-boost-for-leo-varadkar-despite-give-away-budget-36248931.html“No poll boost for Leo Varadkar despite ‘give away’ budget”rte.ie/news/politics/2017/1021/914230-opinion-poll-sbpredc/“Support for main parties dips in latest opinion pollThere are no post-Budget gains for either Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil, according to the latest Sunday Business Post/RED C opinion poll. ”:)
 beautiful sarcasm.
 LOL, with FF policies and taking credit for it like Trump is with Obama’s rescue of US economy. A Doctorate, for stupidity is more fitting.
 FF/FG/SF/L, a cancer on our Democracy and should be removed!
    Can I have one as well? I don’t knowingly hurt people and I am articulate when I speak.
 Rescued the economy anyway, ‘rescued the country’s far more contentious.
 And the 100,000+ people who got jobs during his time as Taoiseach.
 well said!
 lol, baiting the shinners. Agree wholeheartedly. Enda was our greatest Taoiseach no doubt.
 one of the greatest liars Ireland ever produced and the most talentless, a disgrace.
 no chance there then
 These ‘awards ‘ are handed out like smarties by third rate Irish institutions to make themselves feel important.His only achievement was to tie a debt mountain around our children’s necks. His economic policy was ‘borrow and be damned ‘.Even the Shinners could do that.
  What drugs are you on ? .. Great Statesman me boll*x  .. man refused to debate any issue without his pre-prepared speak from his 1 million a year team of advisiors   .. he was also a terrible liar .. “Man with 2 pints ”  etc ffsHe more like a MasterDebater.
Devalues any Doctorate that was worked for and earned,Why is it we give these laurels to such hollow, average men of no merit
Journal Truth filter is on full power, Comments removed.
 He deserves one more than Cowen though.
  Agreed on that , I shall be posting my Degree back to them ..
Enda joins a long line of underperforming Taoisigh ,….Biffo, Bertie and Bruton
Enda is outstanding in his field?the scarecrow has frightened all the birds off.
What Taoisigh did well, in your opinion?
It’s immorral and unethical to tax a person’s home, quote from our much esteemed and unethical ex taoiseach
 when did he say that?
 Before he spoofed his way into office, along with all the other empty words. He even put them on billboards, if you remember.
“It is morally unjust and unfair to tax a person’s home, and by so doing grind him into the ground. Indeed in cases it could probably be unconstitutional….It reminds me of a vampire tax in that it drives a stake through the heart of home ownership, through enthusiasm and initiative, and sucks the life blood of people who want to own their own home and better their position” “If the Government fail to appreciate the passion with which people will defend their rights to own their home and have it looking as well as it should, it is making a serious mistake” – Enda Kenny
 I asked you when he said that quote? Beautiful avoidance of the question as usual. When, what year exactly?Secondly – your talking outright lies when you say that quote was printed on a billboard. Link to prove it please? Take your time.
 He said it in 1994
 Why does it matter when? If it is “morally unjust and unfair to tax a person’s home” then, why shouldn’t it be now, or vice versa?
http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/1994/02/02/00007.aspand there is the official Dail debate record of that day.
 Link didn’t work properly , the statement was made on Wed 02/02/1994
http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1994020200007?opendocument
 Thanks Carl. 1994 eh? Almost a quarter of a century ago. Simon Harris was probably about 5 years old then! Surely to god it’s fair for a persons viewpoint on taxation to change over such a massive period of time, particularly in a political context? I mean, Gerry Adams and Ian paisley were allowed to have a dramatic change of political outlook since 1994 weren’t they? Maybe I should dig out some Sinn Fein from quotes from 1994, to see how they would stack up in 2017??The Celtic tiger didn’t even exist in early 1994, never mind the recession after it. Homosexuality was only decriminalised a few months when enda made that statement. A few lifetimes ago in political terms.Pathetic that Ye are trying to dig up quotes like that to have a go at someone 25 years later. Grow up.
 jammin – still waiting on the link to that billboard. Oh wait – It doesn’t exist! Lol, scarlet for ya!
 Your not stupid you know he said itExcerpts from Dáil Debate, Wednesday 2nd February 1994Mr Enda Kenny TD“It is morally unjust and unfair to tax a person’s home, and by so doing grind him into the ground. Indeed in cases it could probably be unconstitutional”“It reminds me of a vampire tax in that it drives a stake through the heart of home ownership, through enthusiasm and initiative, and sucks the life blood of people who want to own their own home and better their position”
 great post.
 You talk some s##t.
 you’re right. I’m not stupid. I know well he said it… IN BLOODY 1994!!!! Hardly relevant a quarter of a century later! Totally different era and different context, as you know quite well!
 it is true your heart throb did really say that, try snd keep up…

 I asked you when he said that quote? Beautiful avoidance of the question as usual. When, what year exactly?- lol scarlet for ya…
No wonder he went on to create so many homeless then.
Sure why not giving these out like confetti
Acting the eejit is now a university degree?
 True, confetti is dirt cheap, seemingly hon doctorates are too.
In other news the value of an NUIG degree has plummeted.
“In recognition of his tireless work doubling the number of children in persistent poverty, adding €30,000,000,000 to our national debt that our granadkids will still be paying, and firesaleing our housing stock to vulture funds while letting them off with miniscule tax bills, I would like to present enda kenny with this now completely discredited and worthless award.”
Absolutely disgusting
 and Dr. Jim B knows feck all either. not much of an academic in my view but very savvy politically in NUiG.
Not one of my children will set foot in a university in Ireland after reading this. This man should be in jail along with Brian cowen and bill Clinton, instead they are elevated in status.Suspected it for years…. Our universities have been bought up and are ran by psychopaths.
 God help your kids, and good luck paying for them to go to university abroad. Never saw someone so quick to cut off his nose in spite of his face.  You have amazing principles!
So because NUIG is giving Enda an honorary degree you are going to stop your children going to an Irish university and potentially damage their entire careers. Well, if your children take their intelligence (or lack of) from their Daddy then I don’t think you will ever need to enforce this.
 That’s a new level of thick right there.
 LOL great response to stupidity
 John, you are right. Bill Clinton repealed the Glass Steagall act imposed by FDR to prevent a repeat of 1929 Wall Street crash directly leading to WW2…and 8 years after Clinton repealed it….history repeated itself. Of course the idiots commenting here have no clue.
 has to be one of the stupidest comments I’ve ever seen on the journal and that’s saying something. Your poor kids.
Well done Enda.. Much deserved. He brought us out of some very difficult times.
 Are you for real.A lying coward is all he is,(Not one cent will be paid to the bondholders).The EU couldn’t have handpicked  better lapdog.
Genuine question, what point are you making re bond holders?
 He got elected on the promise of burning them and then went back on his word.He also sabotaged the investigation into the bankers by not providing adequate resources to investigate them.
 MERKLE
brought us out of some very difficult times Straight into even harder times.neither qualified or capable
 He was elected and its a democracy.  If you want to blame some thing blame capitalism.
 “Straight into even harder times”, Maybe look at economic growth from 2011, to 2017. Those figures don’t lie.
John, was it not the EU who insisted on us not burning bondholders or allowing any bank go under? It’s possibly a sign of naivety at most that Irish politicians were human enough to want to burn the bondholders before election but it wasn’t until the whole financial crisis balloned and Greece happened that tiny Ireland was seen to be just a pawn and we had lost control. You can hardly blame Enda Kenny on that.
 “I’ll end the scandal of hospital trollies”…………
 Look bort how many times must it be said, it is no good having a great economy if only a minority benefit. Will you open your eyes and see the state the country is in, homelessness, people on trolleys, 600,000 on waiting lists etc,etc,etc.Kenny and his cronies are responsible for this.
 Neither do the figures relating to homelessness, patients on trolleys, suicide rates etc., etc…
 Could you be more precise when you say “us”.
 WAKEY WAKEY John. If he did what you wanted him to do we’d be in the same state or worse state than Greece. History will be deservingly kind to Enda. Ireland’s greatest Taoiseach by a long stretch. Bloody shinners and their burn the bondholders supporters would have driven us into the ground. He’s the poster boy of the EU cos he showed what true leadership in a recession looks like.
 thank goodness for the EU
 harder times??? I don’t see them.. Sure the boom is back!! Haven’t you heard?? Oh and Enda is 40+ years in politics.. Very qualified.
 I’m not a shinner but let’s face it  that Moran from Mayo would not do a debate amongst the other party leaders.
 in 100years he will still be remembered as a moron
Leapraucaun and voodoo economics. Do not be fooled. Look at the real numbers for emigration, homelessness and child poverty. Still years to go to exit the recession, but with FG in power,zero chance of that actually happening.
So he worked as a school teacher briefly until daddy died and took over his seat in the Dail,That was 1975 yet he held onto his teaching job up to a few years ago while the pension was accruing.He couldn’t string a sentence together and had the son of a very well known comms clinic give him lessons on speaking.
Wonder will he finally visit Tuam as he hasnt done so since the babies discovery
Doctor Joke.
He was at the helm of the Irish Water fiasco and now we want to reward him. Disgraceful.
“You could do with a day’s work, I’d say “
“It is morally wrong, unjust and unfair to tax a persons home”- Enda Kenny, 1994. And what he do?
 looked for some quotes from Gerry Adams from 1994. Couldn’t find them. He was banned from the airwaves back then for spending the previous 25 years murdering people in the name of the provisional IRA!
And Enda the hypocrite led the 2016 celebrations for the 1916 rising!
Adams was leading the way in the peace process at that stage in 1994.
Congratulations Enda , you saved our country. The great patriot of modern times.
 ya right-He saved himself and his 3 pensions-He was good at the crocodile tears
 “The great patriot of modern times”Funny sort of patriot that bows to german demands to have fiscal rules put into our constitution, no?
 we are a tiny island off the coast of Europe. Too right he bows down to Germany. The way you go on like we’re a super power cop on would ya.
 You got no pride in your own country David?
 well said lad
 ur def not well pal
An honorary doctorate in discrediting the office of taoiseach. I don’t think irish politicians deserve such accolades full stop.
A direct insult against anyone who’s had to spend years of hard work to get a PhD. Any decent human being would respectfully decline an honorary degree out of respect for those who work hard for them. I’ve always thought you’d have to be a bit of a dick to accept one. Especially if you’ve already got a high profile job and salary and have absolutely no need for a degree other than to give yourself a pat on the back… for nothing
Ah well, I’ll remember this next time they come looking for ex student donations…
This is the Uni elite paying homage to the political elite. FG very happy and will throw a few sweeties to UCG when the time is right. It’s called cronyism. It is practised by many political parties in the republic of “OPPORTUNITY”.
He looked after himself and his buddies . Nice pension at what age ? When he leaves the dail he will also get the lotto winnings with it . ( lump sum ).what a country we live in . He has not been in the dail very often since Leo took his position. He doesn’t care or give a damn about the people only the highest flyers . So let all the rest of us shut up and pay the tax    /stealth taxes etc etc
Within 5 minute NUIG dropped 10 places in the World university Rankings
Who cares, one ignorant a@@hole,
He will be conferred by the 130 year old oak in the green area in recognition of his wooden traits
They have difficulty deciding the name. Doctor of Mayo; doctor of Tom foolery; doctor of FG; doctor of the long finger.
 Doctor of the middle finger more likely.
In a statement it said it honours those “who, whether in their personal or representative capacities, through their energies, service and actions, have contributed significantly to public life”.So why honour this parasite?
 yeah, a chancer with a HDiP who’ d say whatever to gain power and money plummeted to Phd status based on zero.
Leo Varadkar is on a YouTube video saying….not 1 red cent to the banks. This line got Enda elected in 2011 cause we as fools believed them. They all lied.
Why don’t they give him the freedom of of the country . He’s had everything else he could grab
 ha!
 except THE SAM
Omg. my alma mater is UCG and er..  jim browne is now in charge.. hmm. go back 2 1908 policy of conferring based upon real achievement. I guess business policy has taken over from acadamic achievement.
Worry not my friends…..Muirthiertach gave an honorary degree to the guy who makes the panninis some years back…..wired to a parallel universe these academics..
A mediocre Taoiseach , who accidentally rose through the ranksHistory will view him as an example of how the village idiot can emerge  .
 I think people reading your comment will see who the real village idiot is.
 Yeah. You. You Endabot. He used short term solutions for long term problems. Which is why so many people commenting have issues with him receiving a doctorate.
Leave Enda alone. He probably averaged 100k per year for 40 years in Dail Eireann and expenses to cover the house/appt in dublin. Plus a pension we can all be jealous of.
isn’t our old “tea shake” looking well
Doctor Who.
And what lovely curtains they are wearing as well?Anyone else feel that there is too much pals of pal stuff in this brown envelope land?
Man boobs in the 2nd pic.    What an ass hole he still is.
 stop talking about yourself
 Shelia Kenny.
Reacting to an in my view incorrect post on hoteliers. the reduced vat rate is good. i was in holland many times on business during the last 6 months. what they call “horeca” ie. hotels restauraunts etc is all on 6% vat!!!! But, they pay their workers a higher rate too….the system works well.
These ‘awards ‘ are handed out like smarties by third rate Irish institutions to make themselves feel important.He looks like a right prat in the photo.
Disgraceful
He makes me sick, even looking at him.
 Funny if he was on the cover of Playboy next lol.
Still claiming TD’s salary while working outside the country?
people here criticising enda are the same people who criticised all the politicians before him and will criticise all the politician’s after him. Government is always the bad guys. Well,we live in a democracy and these guys are here because we voted for them as a country…..if ya don’t like it theres plenty of planes and boats leaving everyday…..off ya go.
 Fg lost a lot of votes in the last election because they lied to the people about not bailing out banks. then when the people voted for them they did a 180deg turn and increased tax left right and center to pay these banks off. Fg increased rents while giving out about high rents by introducing 4 new taxes on rental income 1) usc 2) prsi 3) 25% reduction from 100% to 75%  on mortgage interest relief on rental property 4) local property tax LPT. FG must think we are complete idiots but we are not.
 that’s fair enough…I’m not defending them. If FF were running the country people’s opinion would be the same 12 months down the line.seems like a national pass time to moan about whoever is in power at the time. Same all over the world I suppose.
NUIG are a disgraceful gang of brown nosing A -licks.I had considered doing an on line Irish degree with them,costing 3 grand,but will now spend that elsewhere. I would be ashamed to hold any qualification this University would hand out.
I’ve a masters from nui… Not galway but by association it’s down graded mine… Can I get my money back please… I paid cash… Long before they were free… I probably need indemnity on my DBA now after this.
It seems de riguer in this country to dole out doctorates to these buffoons after a period as leader.I recall Reynolds decked out in a robe and mortarboard before embarking on a series of lectures in the States.I ask you,who in the name of Jaysus wants to hear,let alone pay for the privilege of listening to these morons.I see Kenny is now being paid 22k a throw for an after dinner speech,as was that doyen of buffoons,Ahern when he retired.Apart from which of course these speeches,these gems of wisdom,are written and prepared by their minions in the civil service.These idiots themselves have no input other than mouthing the words before them.
Pepper Brooks14hours ago I asked you when he said that quote? Beautiful avoidance of the question as usual. When, what year exactly?- lol scarlet for ya…
Ha ha ha ha  …  FFS but its not funny its a disgrace.Over 40 years as a politician and what did he achieve, what great things did he do for Ireland etc.. F all in my opinion  .. Double jobbing and getting paid for it  up till 2010 until he became Taoiseach as realized it would look to good. First thing he did in power was to break the pay rules for his friend and advisor.. Soon his nest of vipers, I mean advisor team where costing the tax payer over 1 million a year.  This disgrace and traitor to Ireland and its people changed his colors more than a chameleon ..Remember his  “Its morally unjust and unfair to tax a persons home “, ” Contract with the People” , “I will sack the wasters of Tax Payers Money” ” The 5 point plan” ” Free GP’s”  (for various ages, depending on who he was talking to and of course) ” I’m worth it ” and lest not forget all the the different things he threatened would happen if people didn’t pay Irish Water, from increasing tax, to cutting of supply to people..Over 40 years in Politics and this is his Legacy  ..Property TaxIrish Water.Huge PensionYeah he is a great man indeed  ..  yeah great at feathering his own next
+ Back to Education Allowance and University Grant.
Ireland’s debt to gdp ratio, as gifted to the country by Fianna Fáil, has gone from 120% to 74% under Fine Gael.Buy that man a pint – no, buy him two pints. That’s the way he rolls. huah!
 gdp isn’t really relevant in Ireland’s case. We have the third highest debt per capital in the world.
A tad desperate from NUIG
Ends, outstanding in his field? like a scarecrow more like.
 scarecrows are more useful!
 Dr Strangelove!
 Dr. Fu(kstick..
Who’s presenting it?Angela Merkel, for obedience to German rule and enslavement of your people.Three cheersHail KennyHail KennyHail Kenny.For hes a jolly good German, for hes a jolly good German, for he’s a jolly good German and so say all of us.
This devalues the worth of honorary and academic Doctorates.It’s a shrewd strategic move, so as to leverage funding support.Future Taoisigh, such as Varadkar,  will stay on the right side of Universities in the hope of picking up an honorary Doctorate or 2.Ex Taoiseach Brian Cowan has picked up a Doctorate.
 Honorary doctorates  from Unis never really had any value. They’re usually just given out to those who pal up to Universities or to those who are liked by whoever happens to be in charge of the selection committee at any particular time.
 Kenny may have been inept but Cowen (like his FF crony before him Ahearn) was despicably corrupt and a disgusting liar and fraud. His bolshy, arrogant, horrible lie in front of his country of ‘not discussing Anglo affairs while playing golf with Seany Fitzpatrick’ was a slight on the intelligence of the Irish people and rotten in the extreme.
 I think Barack Obama did something similar
 It just shows the utter shite we put up with on a political level. And we just keep voting them in.
is this where we’ve arrived God help us
Will Dr Kenny  be available  to work in A  Edepartment  in  G U H   ??
Who?
Worthless both the Doctorate and the recipient .
He will be remembered as the greatest bluffer the country has ever seen lol ” it’s a great little country to do business” it is if your apple lol
no worries there, he’ll probably get lost on the way to collect it, fecken eejit !
FFS
Predictable responses on here. Congratulations Enda. I never voted for you but you did your best with the little you had and steered the ship through some dark times. Nothing he did was ever going to be popular with the masses due to the mess he inherited from the Fianna Fáilure. There. I said it.
 lol if you never voted for him, well who the f&&k did you vote for because this is pretty much as far to the right you can go unless your a nazi lol come on now Tom Tom tell the truth you did vote for him
 I will give him credit for telling the church to go f themselves but thats it.More than that pandering b€€€€rd Cosgrave did, he was balls deep in the Catholic church and their abuse.
 Tom Tom fg have been inheriting ff mess and vice versa for nearly 100 years now. Did you not know its all part of the game. The 2 of them are no different.
 Nevertheless, history will be kind to Enda…
 that’s because we will all be dead and gone and the elites will rewrite the history books to make it kind to their type lol
 you are joking!
Another award made into trash by the establishment.
This should be popular…
Which one is worse Kenny or Biffo.
 And now we are blessed with a shiny new one – Leo FTW !!! What a guy !!!
Ohh my God!!… I’m still on this bloody island!
They  printed on jax roll now?
 I think one of those should be presented to Bertie the Anorak.
So now you can earn a doctorate for being a yes man and doing nothing of note. Sign me up.
The West’s Asleep!
DID ENDA KENNY GET THE 5 EURO RISE IN THE PENSION FROM THE BUDGET? ? ?
People work hard to earn a doctorate enda earned a fortune by not working.
Toss pot
I feel sick.
Why?
 for:Being a clown.taking it up the ar$e from angela.His 5 point plan.His contract for Government.Being a spoofer.His unwillingness to debate with vincent browne.His unwillingness to answer any Dail questions.All the hospitals which he closed.etc. etc.
Is he still around the Pratt
Apparently on his way to the podium he met a man with two Professorships in each hand  and bundles of Post Grads hanging out of his wallet, who wanted to thank him personally for having the foresight, for building the Taj Mahal and being the first man to walk on the moon!“That’s one small step for Enda Kenny, but fortunately a huge leap fr the rest of humanity!”He stated totally unabashed!
Kenny should still be Taoiseach
I will give you a green thumb for bravery.
 He made an art of low achievement. Imagine if for that period we had an individual of drive and vision and ability who did more than just worry about covering up his ineptitude and hanging onto his job.
 hahahaha
If only we could pay his multiple pensions in monopoly money.
Will ya’s give it up, He was Taoiseach of this Country for over 6 years, no matter what politics we belong to we cannot begrudge this to him.
 Troll comment?
 you FG troll, try and be a bit more subtle
As a Galway person, I really DO think this is an honor too far ! A failed leader who never won an election oughtright and along with Noonan msde sure that the little person paid for & are still paying for the Corupt, greed, and incompetent Arogant Bankers  and (Now back in business) Bankcrupt developers and bondholders. What a failure (except for looking after himself and his lot) Kenny was and still is !?
I would like to confere on Edna a kick up the hole.
 LOL!
puppet , puppets on a string
Clearly just wants to be a doctor like Dr V.
Recognition for more than 40 years as a legislator who offered not one piece of legislation to tar the image of a true Irish politician. He should be awarded the keys of the bog below Belmullet to boot.
These two dinosaur parties have ruined our country together with their owner’s in Bank’s and big business have passed there gambling debts on to us and our future generations…
Sooo a village is missing it’s Doctor now???
Can’t believe people in this country still refer to FF as a different party to FG ???   Wake up people, they are of one and have been for quite a few years…. it’s our media who tell us that we have a choice !!
Why oh why would you honor this gombeen in any way,
Why?Is there any reason he’s to be handed a doctorate? Did he do something????Absolute waste of money handing out sweetie jar doctorates. Undeserved as no reason to give to him. He was doing a job(only reasonable job) and was being paid for it so why is he getting this ridiculous bit of paper for doing nothing. Typical waste of money
This idiot gets a doctorite for ruinning this country
Remembered for “nearly bringing peace”.  So he didn’t, that’s not an achievement.  I’m sure he was a good man to many, but he put his religious beliefs and the church before the needs of the country.
 or you could say he realised his beliefs were not everybody’s and he made an attempt to legalise contraception, even tho he himself was personally opposed. He was one of the last to vote in the Dail that day, so as not to unduly influence others.
 What are you, his biographer?
 The cheek of presenting an informed opinion on these forums. For shame.
 People who lived through the 70′S generally have a different view of that era despite the hardships in different parts of the country. Agriculture and the fishing industry was beginning to boom by the end of that decade and many of the cultural influences of a confident nation began to come into their own on an international stage . It must appear like a downtrodden nation to the eyes of people who now cast the Catholic Church as a villain and indeed it does deserve a lot of criticism however that perspective is unfair as it is on Cosgrave.  The deadpan demeanor of that leader would now be out of place in the megawatt social media of today but at that time it was appropriate even if it was gently mocked -https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzu1ToAxdFkR.I.P Mr Cosgrave
 most people won’t appreciate your researched and balanced comment on this forum
Brian Cowan looking the picture of wellness.
 cmon. Give us a break. He’s on s big pension.
 he looks like he’s on an s big bender.
Listening on the radio this week to the many politicians who knew him he comes across as having been an absolute gentleman but as a teenager in the early 70′s I have clear memories of his election posters around Dunlaoghaire with his stern face with a stubby little mustache staring down at me and thinking he looked a bit like you know who : (
 Freddie Mercury?
 how did you guess?
 Willie O’Dea?
 maybe if Leo grew a moustache he’d look like Freddie. Don’t insult one of the greatest performers

He will be remembered by people who suffered from him not representing them.
Enda, Bertie and Brian all looking well fed the pension must be agreeing with them…..
May he Rest In Peace, but I hope we never see a leader of his kind in a progressive outlooking country ever again.
 “I hope we never see a leader of his kind in a progressive outlooking country ever again”.I totally disagree with you. The ‘Celtic Tiger’ and the subsequent crash it caused would not have been allowed under his leadership in my opinion.
 we would never have had a Celtic tiger under his leadership
 wake up. His government introduced additional taxes like all the others. Not a good legacy
 how so ????
“how so ????”He always put the people and country first so he would have ensured that the continuous rise in property prices would be resisted in whatever way needed. Also his government would continue the policy of building sufficient social housing thereby stemming the relentless ‘bubble’ from forming. The FG of then was a totally different party to the sham of a FG we have now. I was always a FG voter in the past but alas no more.
 isn’t this the kind of policy SF are fighting for I am sure they would love your vote in the next election.
 “Isn’t this the kind of policy SF are fighting”.That’s why SF will be getting a high placing on my next GE ballot paper.
Looks from the picture here as if the “ordinary” people were kept outside the church.  Can’t have them mixing with the elite.
 ot doesnt look loke thst at all. A lot of people wait outside till the remains go in,then follow.
 This is the sort of horseshite comment that has these comment sections ruined. My jaysis.
 REALLY are you for real
RIP but RTE are a total disgrace.http://www.dannymorrison.com/water-is-too-good-for-them-sean-orourke-rte/
 yes shows him up for what he was. I wouldnt want a leader like him.
 RTE west brits. No representation of the people of Ireland.
 p##ck
Despite all their money, we must have the ugliest bunch of politicians in the world. It probably wouldn’t be as bad if you had a good-looking bunch riding ya!!
 lol it would certainly ease the burden
Polling the electorate.
 what about Regina. Surely you love her looks.
 a come now Leo is looking very cool and smart in his new role.  With his height and sallow skin he stands out above the rest. Credit where credits due.
It may have been a partial state funeral but it would appear the ecclesiactics were out in strength….always a worrying sight…
It looked like a state funeral to me.
Does that buffoon Harris only have one suit and tie to his name !
40 years pension. did he really need it at his age?
Does Bertie’s pension get paid into a bank account…has he got a bank account ??? for years he managed without one !!!

I was at the funeral, it was very dignified. They allowed us local peasants in to see it.
He was a great Leader, and to those who say he put his religious beliefs first before his country, Don’t you mean he put God first ?
“I can’t trust a man who doesn’t drink, because a man who doesn’t drink doesn’t trust himself.”
There’s nothing as pure as a reformed whoore.
 I love  the gaming machines with flashy  lights in the bookies   can i be trusted..
 correct Stephen! Absolutely!
 bull shit.
More self indulgent drivel to rehabilitate the credibility of the “Man from Rio”The electorate will cast their own judgement soon enough!
 In fairness, Lord Ross will once again top the poll.
 my god you’re arrogant. Not everything is about you. And a classic line at the end which amounts to “people will vote in a democracy “
 Men from Rio there were 2 but Kevin Mallon seems to have vanished just like Pat Hickey.
I’m delighted Edna made him laugh as do we the taxpaying eejit’s who fund him in his Ministerial role. Wasn’t it soooo easy for him as both stockbroker / senator roles to give up drink.  He saw the gravy train pulling up. He’s got many many options to get around……public transport and expenses not to have to worry about drink driving. Gawd he makes my blood boil and before anyone says I agree with drink driving please take note it’s not the person with two pints in a country pub driving home who kills, it’s the fools who have six or seven and then speed mostly young on their way from the pub to a late nite somewhere. But sure it’s alright because he doesn’t drink nor depend on a simple car to get around.
 I’m afraid the statistics might be against you there Mary. Most road deaths are actually in rural/country areas, and young folk nowadays, on average, don’t drink and drive half as much as their parents did.
 Most road deaths are in Donegal and it’s not rushing to mass the sped is for
@Mary Murphy stats please to your incoherent statement
 what a idiotic statement. To clarify, you say if he was an alcoholic it was easier to fight it cause he was rich? I dont know if you’re a fake account but you certainly are a stupid one
 you obviously missed the report earlier this week that said young people are drinking and driving in greater numbers
 Increasing yes, but still much lower than for my generation..
Shane Ross,I used to respect him for his understanding of what happened in the crash here never let the establishment get away with anything!But now he has lost those values since he has got into bed with the rest of the “Alliance”.Stepaside Garda Station reopening is a joke.Him and John Halligan have shown their hand.New Politics my Bollox
A very honest response, can’t blame him for that
Not sure why but he has become a hate figure for the media…..They all echo the various negative  stories about him with great realise
 It is because he was so vocal as a journalist and in opposition. It was all populist nosnense but he had a following. Then he got into power and was shown up for his bluster as the weakest and most publicity hungry politician we have seen in my generation.
 exactly, hes changed nothing.
 so you want a stubborn, dont take no shit from amyone ,al capone politician? Do you think a politician should have their mind set on every issue and never change?
Every now and then I thought he spoke sense as a journo, now he’s shown up for what he is, opinionated fool who’s got little to no knowledge of what he should do. The guy is a catastrophe waiting to happen, opinions on everything yet knowledge in nothing. Having said that, it’s practically every government ever, it’s just role seems to span from a to z… Who gave that remit. He’s like the Ray D’Arcy of the government!
And now Ross is taking out his personal guilt on the general public, like a real Puritan! As if everyone was as susceptible to such habits as he is!
30 years ago I think everyone drove while over the limit!
Off the drink? What about the time he went on a bender and ended up in rio for no logical reason.
He’s a spoofer and it’s as simple as that
Okay, but you’re not in your thirties any more sp could you please start workimg on the rural transport crisis
Makes Paul Murphy appear sane….
The poor me syndrome by the worst minister ever – I call him the minister for nothing. Bonding with FG. Not needed for him. He was already established as a blueshirt with his mid Atlantic accent.
No harm not drinking  but don’t like puritanical drink driving laws making criminals of people – go after the drinks companies not the people. Judicial appointments Bill seems to be a crock too – lay people committees ( appointed by the Government) do the picking and Government still gets final approval- as far as I can see. Used to like SR but ego seems to be taking over.
He clearly wasn’t drinking enough as he still went into politics.
Well done for privatization of our transport to another country sending more money out of our economy an into another’s. Funny tat its his own country he gave it to wa×nker
Dutch? We’d be better off with Dutch from Predator than you
Hi ShaneJust because you didn’t go for treatment doesn’t mean your not an alcoholic.If your in your 30′s and your drinking is affecting all aspects of your life I’m pretty sure your an alcoholic
The can of Dutch wasn’t from some Luas construction worker (harsh claim!). It was from some lads having the craic.Proof:https://m.facebook.com/events/137267053514391?view=permalink&id=138914670016296
This goon is making headlines yet will do f*ck all for drink driving. Enforcement is the best way to reduce drink driving. More effective than sentencing as a deterrent. But it costs money. Just like the 19000 people waiting for a camera procedure, money  not invested is causing deaths. But what do we see plastered over the news???? , Dublin bus have lost some routes….Who gives a f*ck ? I’m no party gombeen but this country needs a HUGE swing to the left.
 I’m aware that you might find a contradiction there.Allow me to clarify. I don’t mean who gives a f#ck exclusively, rather there are many issues far more in need of giving a f#ck to.
What an utter knobhead ……
Another turn coat , no thanks
He’s clarified it, he doesn’t drink- do we have to bang on about it?
He’s such a hypocrite it irritates me. All the rules around drunk driving he’s brought in. Despise him
 He irritates me a bit too Breno, but hard to justify calling him a hypocrite when he’s reformed from what he volunteered he did that long ago?
 It’s very easy for him to reform. He got on the gravy train thirty years ago and he’s finally hit his reward. It’s been very worthwhile for him to give up drink. But he doesn’t have a clue about country living and doesn’t care. And I’m living in Dublin so I can only imagine the death he’s giving to country living jobs and social life in the ass hole of nowhere with his jumped up clueless half glass of beer idea
 ah the clueless “they dont get my problems”!Which is staggering since your post tries to illuminate rural issues but you say you live in dublin and can only “imagine ” what they go through. You’re a moron
I knew this guy was a reformed drunk. Couldn’t get enough and now he want to punish everybody else who was not ad stupid as him. Of course he had the money to throw around three decades ago. He is tight -it damaged his brain and made him act like the clown he is now.
If he doesn’t drink why is he holding a can, and of all alcoholic beverages why would he chose dutch gold?
https://m.facebook.com/events/137267053514391?view=permalink&id=138914670016296
Now your just a waste of space .. time for a drink
 Hic! Hic! zzzzzzzzzzz!
 thanks for the link, it puts it in another light
He appears to be suffering from dry drunk syndrome, perhaps he should get treatment!
Dont forget who ross is a force for the top 1% nationally, while hiding behind his constituents short term interests. Every time I see ross the so called ‘transport minister’ its to prop up his and healy reas own ego at the expense of everyone else, while propping up this government’s housing crisis, public services crisis, privatisation of the transport sector, privatisation of our water the bin charges gouging the private bank debt bailouts the free market mantra on health housing and education. The independent Alliance has alot to answer for in this government who will vote for them now?
I’m sure Enda Kenny felt more positive about finding a solution to the border issue.That was months ago though. Varadkar is rightly worried about the situation now, we are weeks into negotiations and nobody still seems to know what the British Governments position on Brexit is.
 Heard this absolute spoofer Jones splutter his way through the interview this morning.Cited the US/Canada border as something to emulate – despite the fact that 1) they have a free trade agreement and 2) it is a hard border with passport checks.He was utterly clueless and offered no further detail which is exactly the point Varadkar was making.UK is sleepwalking into disaster, led by rabbit-in-headlights leaders.
 Enda Kenny was a bullshitter, a lying, self-serving FG hack.
Varadkar is a spoofer. His staff, when che was Health Minister, will vouch for that.
“His staff, when che was Health Minister, will vouch for that.”Link please.
 So this clown Jones wants Ireland to do the heavy lifting because the Brits have no idea what they’re doing. It’s their Brexit so they can Feck off.
http://www.thejournal.ie/varadkar-hospitals-2590842-Feb2016/‘In an interview in the Sunday Independent, Varadkar said: “What can happen in some hospitals is sometimes, when they have more beds and more resources, that’s what kind of slows it down.”’All hat, no cattle.
 brexit is going to happen, we need to sort things out with our friends in the UK. The toxic EU is complicating  the situation.
 Correct. Theres a story in the Irish Times about Varadkar ordering a halt to investigating solutions to Brexit. Looks like his plan is to allow us to be used as a stick to beat the British with, regardless of the consequences for ordinary folk.
 why should we help, it’s their Brexit, we’re staying, it’s their border, we don’t want one, and they’re clueless about what they want from every aspect of Brexit.
 What a childish and myopic comment. It’s not ‘their’ Brexit, it is the Brexit of everyone who will be severely impacted by no proper solutions being found, which includes here in Ireland. And that will only come through bilateral agreements and measures being agreed and implemented.
 There in lays the problem. They have no idea what they want to agree to. They are so busy infighting that are not giving a solution any thought.
 there’s no way Leo Varadkar regrets his comments   Otherwise he would not have repeated his comments in Belfast. He is absolutely right. Anyway Ireland has a veto over whatever Britain comes up with. Varadkar is in a strong position.
 ‘ Varadkar is in a strong position.’LOL!
 so having a veto is not a strong position??? Please explain.
 you and I had no say in it so it can’t be OUR Brexit.
 and any debate that uses derogatory terms such as “childish” and “myopic” is an indicator of either, the lack of a valid argument, or an inability to articulate a valid argument.
I asked for a link backing up the invented assertion that HSE staff claimed Varadkar was a spoofer.Your link provided absolutely zero quotes from any HSE staff backing that ridiculous claim (made by Christy Nolan).Why provide a completely irrelevant link?Is it because no such back up exists?To use your phrase – your link was all hat not cattle.
 don’t waste your time with the Risen aka Jammin. A complete spoofer and shinner has been.
 Yes,and you forgot to mention a European lap dog who loved the odd pat on the head for  liking his masters boots.
 When did the “ordinary Irish folk” ever matter to the EU?
 The EU is not about individual states but the Union as a whole. One may as well ask the same question about “ordinary Spanish folk” or “ordinary Czech folk”  just as the Federal US government is about it’s whole. Worrying about each individual populace is the job of individual governments.
Don’t worry lads, far left loonies “The Risen” and “Danny Foley” are in agreement with each other. We can all rest easy now.
 Our “friends” can go sort it out themselves. They made their bed and they can lie in it.
Why would he regret his statement when the whole Country was agreeing with him?
 the “whole country”? I suggest you may be wrong there.
Anyone with any pride in their country is agreeing with him.
 what a pathetic statement, seriously you are better than that.
Yeah – you’re right. Was petty and inaccurate. I’ll ask for deletion.Apologies Paul.
 you always get a couple of gobsh*tes so apart from them yes it’s the whole country
 So now you’re speaking for the UK AND Ireland?
 I only speak for myself and common sense. Ireland has a capable leader so he can speak on its behalf. The UK’s leaders are divided and without direction so unfortunately the UK has no one to speak for it.
 You should mad comment
 I have pride in my coutry but not in the idiotic govt we have had ths past few years who are only interested in looking good not in how the country is run or how the people as a whole are doing….
Heaven forbid that the petulent Irish should get in the way of the British and their glorious Brexit. Let them propose their technological solution, and lets see the Irish response backed by the EU26.
 it actually depresses me that we already have a British post Brexit minister. That’s how long this shit has been going on and still the British don’t know what they want. 3% of Irish businesses have a plan for Brexit and I’d say the rest are baffled by what is going to happen with Brexit. The British want it all but don’t want to compromise!!! I’d say Leo said that to focus them and he’s right! Why should we come up with solutions to something they voted for and we don’t want!!?
 oh yeah, a comment by Leo Varadkar is what is going to do it.
Paddy needs to know his place.Adult countries are having a Brexit and the little guy should keep quiet.
 Yep, and leo is back in his box ,
Leo has balls, Enda had none, that’s the difference. All this uncertainty over Brexit has us all on edge – Why should we, or the people of NI, suffer at the whim of the English?  Sort out your own mess!
 English?
 It seems that Mr Kenny operated  on the assumption that politicians are reasonable and quiet diplomacy is better than megaphone politics but all bets are off here and must be seen to be off. Raising the standard of discussion is the only avenue available to distance ourselves from the nightmare of conservative/labour ideologies until some common sense prevails in our close neighbours.
 @Paul Fahey We COULD say Britain, and forget the fact that the people of Scotland and NI voted to stay in the EU. Maybe THIS is what he means?
 Yes English. Scots and NI voted to remain.
 Was going to say just that, Kenny had no balls. It cost us when he refused to stand up on the issue of bond holders. The only time he showed fight was when he criticised the church. Hardly the bravest stand. At least Varadkar is showing some fight – although whether it is diplomatically astute is another question.
 The English and Welsh are the only two to have voted for Brexit…..
Oh, the hypocrisy around here is something else.Article after article about the 6 counties, and the comments section is filled with people going on about how it’s part of the UK and ‘nothing to do with us’, except for articles about Brexit, when all of a sudden the 6 counties is spoken about as a separate entity due to the result of a vote which had nothing to do with it parting from the UK.
sorry to burst your bubble but the people of britain voted to leave the uk not just the “english” or are you suggesting that if the people of say donegal decided they wanted to leave the EU that would be allright ????
I am sick of hearing about Brexit, magic beans and pie in the sky. The Brits haven’t a clue and don’t know how to apply the brakes to their runnaway train…..
 plus they’re looking back at where the train has been, not where it’s going
Correct.  The dogs in the street know there isn’t going to be a Brexit. No effort whatsoever being made, which is a sensible idea (crafty, mind you).
No trains in border counties !
 hmmm I wish I knew what that  means, or it’s relevance.
 your comment ” looking back at trains….” point being, Irish government doesn’t give a fiddlers about border counties and never has.
 let me introduce you to my friend Blind Freddy, if he can see something and you can’t you have an issue. What he can see is that since the U.K. recently came to the realization that it needs a transition period beyond March 2019 the balance of power in the Brexit talks had shifted to Ireland. This is because an extension of the Brexit deadline triggered by article 50 requires unanimous agreement from all member states. This gives Ireland, or more specifically Leo, the power to veto. So if the British want a border between north and south they ain’t getting one unless he agrees to whatever they propose.
Fair enough
The headline is misleading. Jones never “claimed” Varadkar “regretted” his statement re the border. What he actually said is he THOUGHT Varadkar MIGHT regret his statement. The is a world of difference between the two.
 I agree, that is a brutal headline.
 it’s the Journal murdering the English language in their headlines is what they do, and they do do it well.
 if it wasn’t for the comments section , a marvellous source of entertainment on a daily basis, the Journal would be dead by now based on it’s journalism and copy cat news. I get the impression it is just a bunch of people watching tv or reading news on the net and dropping the stories into the Journal. The odd ” do you agree that potatoes are too expensive ” poll has great originality though !
 they don’t murder the language at all. They use it to change the message the headline should give. Be honest people come here for the commenters and the debate not the journalism.
Thank God he is fighting hard for “Ireland Inc”
 Do I detect a note of sarcasm, or did you misspell ‘Europe inc.’?
“When pressed on what these solutions could be, Jones referenced the border between the US and Canada, and Norway and Sweden.Jones did, however, rule out similar posts at the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.”So he referenced a potential solution, only to then rule that solution out? And what is a “technological solution” anyway? Are they going to put up a firewall now?? More bluster from the Brexiteers, with no clue of what they’re at. Thankfully there’s nobody here angling for an Irish version…
 they have not a single clue between them what it is they want from Brexit, they’re like a rabbit in the headlights
 When the English voted for Brexit the vast majority of those that voted to leave had little or zero idea of the consequences. And it is the internal politics of the Conservative Party that is blocking the chance of giving the population a chance to change their minds. Now that they are staring into the abyss and realizing that the Leave Campaign were lying through their teeth, with a Government that have no clue what to do or even what their negotiating is going to be. A new referendum would swing heavily to remain.
 I agree, except on the possibility of another referendum. The tories have a history of sending the armed forces onto the streets to kill their own citizens rather than admit they where wrong.
Britain should do the honourable thing and do a Brexit from the North.
 UK Brexiting from the North is not what the DUP have in mind!https://eurofree3.wordpress.com/2017/08/06/the-dups-game-plan-for-northern-ireland/
 British voted    Brexit  and I am delighted they had the guts to do it . Ireland fought for freedom and give it away to Europe.
Presumably the French will no longer be required to hold immigrants in Calais and can allow them easy passage back out of the EU over the English Channel?
 the reverse looks more likely. Why would UK just open the floodgates to illegal immigrants from the EU?
 Imagine the French (like Libya) smuggling migrants onto boats and sending them out over the channel so that the Brits have to take them in.
Poor Joseph, you have no idea of the compromises that are coming due to British weakness.
 You seem to have been taken in by Fintan O’Toole’s lazy journalism.
 “Poor Joseph, you have no idea of the compromises that are coming due to British weakness.”And you do?Off ya go…….
 The simple reality is if they want any form of “Soft Brexit” then they are going to have to give way on things like Freedom of Movement and the Customs Union. They are just not up for negotiation on the EU side. Because then the EU would have to re-negotiate  it’s deals with Norway, Switzerland etc . So what it is increasingly looking like is the hardest of hard Brexits. With the British having to place a Hard Border with us which in turn will cripple the Norths economy. Which will also get the double whammy of losing all the EU subsidies it gets. The English are complaining now about the Public money going to Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, they haven felt anything like the sharing they are in for after Brexit.
No border should be put in place on this Island of Ireland full stop.Varadker is spot on and Kenny was telling the imperialist brutes what they wanted to hear.They are going to bring conflict back to our country if we allow them to erect a border.I hope Varadker stands his ground.
 you are aware that the British have been quite clear they do not want a border in NI and if there is one it will be because the EU demand one. So I take it the “imperialist brutes” are the EU?
 So how would the British control immigration without a border? Be it land or sea they need more than the EU surely? In or out of customs union? Current indicators are out. The EU awaits the strategy papers from them
 Varadkar was referring to a customs border. However, we are two relatively small islands, where there are already checks and controls between the two and I cannot see there being any significant difference, but that is for the politicians to address. I assume you are suggesting that migrants may use the north as a gateway to the other parts of Britain? If this proves to be the case then I am quite sure there would have to be a more restrictive regime in place, but the current checks at ports seem to work rather well. EU migrants would have no automatic right to work in the U.K. anymore and non EU migrants would still face the same issue getting into Britain or Ireland. I really don’t see it as a big issue, a hard customs border would be far more damaging to both countries.
 your good at bending the facts: the Brexit was all about keeping dem foreigners out so it’s the Brits alone who want a border.
 If the UK votes based on ‘keeping the foreigners out’ how come UKIP got decimated?There were many reasons for people voting Brexit, and you aren’t in the mind of every single voter in the UK.
 The majority of those that voted Leave had no clue as to the consequences of what it actually meant. Given a second vote now would see a very different outcome.
 the Brexit referendum had a core policy of xenophobia on the leave side and as the leave side carried the day the Brexiteers and UKIP where successful. So I’m unaware of the referendum you’re referring to where they were decimated. Unless you’re referring to the recent general election where all the Brexit parties where decimated by the voters waiting for them with the proverbial baseball bats
 yes Paul I was talking about birders other than customs. It does seem easier to secure the border at the air and sea ports rather than between RoI and NI but I guess the conservatives would need to explain that. But it’s clear the British have no coherent clear message of what they want let alone what they will end up with. But publicly Leo not taking ownership and forcing them to get their house in order is the right. But we are pawns here with both major players
 but nothing much has changed as yet. A few jobs on the way out. The passport queues in the holiday islands is the biggest concern
 That’s because they aren’t out in the cold yet. But one just has to look at how far Sterling has fallen so far and continues to fall. Which in turn makes imports (of which food being one of their biggest) that much more expensive. When you add on new taxes combined with an even weaker Pound after Brexit it will drive up inflation, thus leading to higher wage demands which in turn add to the upward trend of inflation. And all their exports into the EU will also become more expensive due to EU import taxes thus making them less competitive than their EU counterparts.
 its down against the dollar by less than 10% – I get the point you are trying to make but life in UK is the same – No better or worse. The vote was so close that a small swing would change result of course but no compelling reason to go again imho
 It is the same now but what will it be like in 2020 when they are out of the EU and we all know trade deals with other nations take years not months. And during that time the UK will be swinging in the wind paying premium prices for essential goods.
What are they doing in Gibraltar and Spain? Surly they are in a similar predicament? Would the same EU rules apply to both EU countries bordering with the UK? Have the Brexiteers asked the Spanish Government for a solution to their problem too?I think Leo is right, this is a British problem and they need to come up with proper viable solutions, then present these solutions to us and if not agreeable send them back to come up with other solutions until they come up with something agreeable to us. It’s not our problem to solve it’s theirs and they need to get it right, and if they don’t get it right before the deadline then nothing changes until they do.
 Gibraltar is easy to police though from a border perspective. What not clear is the Spanish crossing over to work nor the EU allowing the likes of Paddy Power a license to operate in EU. Suspect a high percentage of jobs there could be at risk in a standoff
Kenny just nodded in agreement to everyone else and asked no questions
Brexit .The English are just fluting around.. they reckon eventually they ll have the same relations with ireland but they trading outside the eu..they must be very tempted to try and draw us away from eu as well.It d be their usual form divide and conquer and give nothing ultimately….
Fintan O’Toole has a plausible explanation for Leo’s approach in today’s Irish Times
 Leo is the Pope Francis of Irish Politics, he is all spin and words with absolutely no substance or actions to show. Look at his political history and ministerial performance, what exactly has he achieved? He is a PR man, plain and simple, all talk and no action.
 which makes it all the more worrying that he manages to upset the little englander. If they had a solution they would have presented it by now.
 Genuine question Paul – do you think his comments on Brexit- and the absolute lack of clarity/detail even suggestions on how a border might work – were wrong?If so, why?
 Not necessarily, but he is guilty of his own criticism am on the matter. It is not just Britain that a border effects, to the contrary it is arguable that it would be more damaging to us and therefore I expect him to be involved in solutions, not point blank refusing to discuss them and firing insults at our nearest and financially best neighbour.Has he ever produced anything of substance? Or is he simply playing to our need for a more, seemingly, progressive Ireland? (and I would class myself as sitting socially to the left of centre).
 O’Toole probably spent all weekend dreaming up that idea…..
 That’s the beauty of this situation. Ireland doesn’t have to do anything. This is entirely a British problem created by the English and as such up to them to solve.
 if you seriously believe that then you don’t fully understand the implications of Brexit on Ireland. You may want to sit there and do nothing whilst a significant percentage of trade with our largest trading partner disappears, but I do not and neither should our politicians. Further, if you believe Varadkar when he says he is doing nothing about the border and it is not for us to do anything about the border, then you are naive in the extreme. It is typical Varadkar, talking, but not walking as illustrated by his ministerial career to date, he achieved nothing, but spoke volumes.
“therefore I expect him to be involved in solutions, not point blank refusing to discuss them”This is where I think the issue lies – I interpreted his comments to mean that he wants to be involved in the solutions but that we need the UK to step forward and propose what those solutions could be as a starting point.There is no benefit to Ireland making suggestions at this stage (quite aside that “frictionless” is a non existent fantasy) because the UK has not defined what exactly it wants.I interpreted his comments as a very necessary and realistic reminder to the UK that the clock is ticking and a failure to prepare will result in chaos.We’ve had a year of them dancing around the topic, refusing to define anything. The mandate May sought to define anything was then refused.We need them to snap out of the meaningless phrases and evasions and start making concrete plans.
 The British need Irish imports simply to feed themselves. Ireland has always been Britains larder. The vast majority of our export trade to the UK is from the food sector. British farmers simply don’t have the capacity or the ability to feed 70 million people. So Britain has no choice but to import food. And as any food coming from the continent will come via “Hard Borders” with all the red tape that implies (delay, expense,etc.) it is far more in their interest  to try and maintain an open/soft border with us. And Britain no longer is as important to Irish trade as it was even 20 years ago. So as I said they need us much more than we need them.
 we see, time will tell
 agreed, only time will tell. Some people will be proven wrong and some right, time will tell.
Build a wall and let the English pay for it?
 English?
 yeh the Scots want out, and the Welsh are away with the Pixies; they want Ireland to pay for their motorways after Brexit so that leaves just the English
“………..Jones said that the British and Irish economies are very closely intertwined, and that the UK’s decision to leave the EU is something that should be addressed by both governments…….”Nonsense !! Britain left Europe so Britain can come up with its own solutions.
Brexit is a misnomer as it implies a clear idea of what a Government wants when it is really a hugely complicated topic that offers no clarity nor ever will . That is why the referendum based on yes/no was a crude position and at variance with its era rather than a straightforward choice so everyone has to deal with the consequences including this country. I believe the ‘stay in/leave’ are two sides of the same phony coin much like ‘climate change’ as the founding principles are so much lacking common sense that it threatens to drag our own politicians into a mire.
Varadkar is like a 5 yr old put into leaving cert class, clueless.
 I think you meant “Jones”, or at least you would have had you read the article rather than the headline
Leo the liar is been found out early….
Huh?On what?Did you read the article? Or hear the interview? Just coz a Tory MP spouts rubbish doesn’t mean that anyone has been “found out”.Good to see you taking the Tory MP’s side though Willy. Fine Republican.
  FG TOOL
Pathetic.I’m a member of no party.Capable of recognising when someone stands up for the country though.
 your comment makes no sense whatsoever given the context of what Leo said
Brexit will have significantly adverse consequences for both Nothern Ireland and Ireland. Technology will not provide a solution to a border.It will be a good time for criminal smugglers and others wishing to exploit a hard border.People call fool themselves that the adverse consequences of Brexit can be magicked away by technology and negotiation but a country which wishes to pull back into itself is not going to leave an open, porous and seamless border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.Unless a soft and nominal “pretend” Brexit can be negotiated, a Brexit in name but not in substance, a hard border is a consequence of a hard and real Brexit.
Spot on there @Tony Daly. There’s an interesting little thing going on in Brexiteer talk. They’ve no solutions to the problems they’ve created but are fast to attack those who point out the problems.Example – milk producers north and south are selling milk both ways -trucks cross cross the border collecting from farms around the border. Currently there are no issues with that milk trade we are in a single market. Nobody can tell me with certainty what the consequences are for this trade post U.K. NI exit as NI will be a third country and with the DUP being hard Brexiteers whilst at the same time talking down the problems it’s no wonder Irish and EU leaders are getting a bit impatient.
Jones has either lost the plot or hasn’t understood that the UK may only negotiate Brexit with the EU commission. Leo has made his views known but, as with all of the 27 remains members, has to go through the commission. This framework was agreed upon to prevent perfidious Albion from attempting to open up divisions among the 27.
Will everyone stop pussyfooting around this issue. There will be a hard border and so be it. We are either members of the club or not. Stop cow- towing toward Frauline Foster and her Tory backing stooges !
Where did this guy come out of the woodwork ? Another ‘expert’ who wouldn’t know a technological solution if it hit him in face. Increasingly it seems the Brits are waking up to the fact that Leo is someone to be reckoned with!!
The Risen: point taken.
why do we care if there is a hard border ? retailers in the south will tell you they lose a lot of business to the north – and as a state we lose tax income to the north . . . I reckon a hard border will be much more difficult for the unionists/loyalists than for us down south . . . they campaigned for Brexit, so let them live with it awhile . . .
 a lot of towns in the republic actually depend on northern shoppers too.  go to Dundalk, Donegal, etc.  full of northeners doing their shopping
Why would Northerners be doing their shopping in the Republic when it’s more expensive to do so? You’re confusing shoppers with tourists, they’re not the same thing.
I’m amazed he wasn’t censored by Fine Gael, coz Mr 15% cowardly fannocks keep getting people barred off politics. Ie for telling the truth they refuse to believe, so we will come on here and other forums to tell people FG is a joke, run by a paper champion who could only muster 15% of the fg membership, how on earth can this man govern this country.
What’s the problem with a border?They don’t want to be Irish or EuropeanSo put a border up and fcuk them
 Not really about “them” (little englanders) though Danny.More about border trade, Good Friday agreement and the divisiveness a hard border could bring both between Ireland’s North and South and internally within the North.
 majority of people in NI voted to stay in the EU
  the majority of “them” do, it’s the lunatic fringe in the DUP that don’t
 A Hard Brexit will mean a Hard Border which in turn will lead to a Unification vote. For Unionists it will come down to a choice. Stay in the UK with a crippled economy and major loss of funds to their own bank balances for the sake of politics or Unite with the Republic, remain in the EU and with a slight alteration in public spending keep the economy on an even keel and money in their wallets. So to boil it down it will be a choice of outdated Politics or Money.
http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/first-major-post-brexit-survey-shows-no-surge-in-support-for-irish-unity-1-8013084
 Sorry Danny but if you have a small transport business in Inishowen Donegal, or want to encourage a factory to set up there, then the border is a bit of a disadvantage. Look at the map.
 None yet, because nobody (not even the UK Government) know what type of Brexit they are going to end up with. A “Hard Brexit will mean a “Hard Border” there will be no way around it. And a Hard Border would be an economic disaster for the North. Just alone the loss of EU Subsidies to Northern Farmers will drive many of them to bankruptcy without even factoring in trade tariffs and other Red tape that goes with movement of goods from outside the EU.
only wag you finger and your tongue Leo when you are sure
We need an election asap to get rid of this clown. He wasn’t voted in by the people of this country and doesn’t speak on my behalf.
Pity they didn’t do more when she was alive. Money spears to be the motivation here.
 they were removed from her at two weeks old when she was sent back to work in the Laundries by the nuns, they did not know whether they were meant to love her or like her over 20 years later, because they had never known her. When they did meet her over 29 years later she carried an empty handbag, because she owned nothing. Margaret went on to die young, possibly connected to her work in the laundries. Out off that story your only ability is to cast adverse aspersions about two victims of the laundries, disgusting. Had it not entered your mind that if they were motivated by money they would have sued twenty years earlier, not just for their mother, but for themselves too.
 they would not receive any money you tool other survivors would. They told their mothers story because it was too late for her but not for others. We have a tradition of punishing women who get pregnant in this country and it still continues.
 Maybe if you you read the article first, then make an assumption. The nuns used and abused the victims in these horrible places, exposed them to chemicals which cost them their lives.
 that’s a ridiculous comment to make you need to educate yourself on what these poor women went through!
 I have fully read the article. I fully understand what went on and more so than a lot making comments here. Bottom line is these two women knew where their birth mother was and left her to it. As children I could understand this but not as adults. Now the poor lady has passes away they are writing her story. They didn’t know her and made no recent attempt to get to know her. So why write a story when their birth Mom is dead. Why not tell it when she was alive. Why not have done something to help her.
 I don’t know who is worse, you or the 247 idiots who liked your heartless post
“She died in July nobody had told us”  how could they not know …whilst i don’t know the full story surely even if they had not spoken to Margaret in a while they would have phoned to see how she was doing during the months July to October . It’s hard to fathom.
 “were we supposed to love her….like her ….I am sure all Margaret  wanted was somebody to put their arms around here and never ever ever let her be alone again .
 taken from your mother at such an early age and finding her so many years later does not make for a “normal” relationship. Have not heard the original discussion but I would say the mother and the twins found themselves not knowing what to say to each other once the initial pleasantries were over.
 busy lives maybe. Many don’t talk to their parents as much as they should because they are busy being parents themselves
Nobody went looking for her either, shame to be giving out after all this time – sinful
 the only ‘sinful’ thing in the whole story is the despicable behaviour of the horrible nuns and their Catholic masters, the government and the Irish society as a whole!These women were enslaved in the name of the despicable cult from Rome and their willing  brainwashed servants in Irish politics&But sure, blame the victims in the typical Irish manner, put your head in the sand and say a little prayer and all will be grand!
 this woman was institutionalised. I’d say her conversation was very limited and she would have had very little self esteem so probably didn’t want to make a fuss. Having a relationship with someone like that would be hard.
 your right about the dispicable behaviour of Irish society and most of your comment is so true my point was  family giving their opinion now is sinful , perhaps if they did not bury their heads in the sand she might not have been there so long ?
 I heard the original Joe Duffy show.  I remember one of the twins expressing that they were a bit nervous of Margaret.  They found her need for love and for a normal relationship overwhelming.  She wanted to be their mum but 20 yrs had passed and they had another mum.  I’ll never forget Margaret nor the injustices she suffered.
 having a relationship could of been hard, but she could of been re-introduced to society and lived as a free woman! People who have murdered have less a sentence and are let back into society with full backing from probation officers, housing etc!! It’s just unbelievable
 wouldve meant therapy and rehab which no one was willing to undertake
Irish people should never forget the horror of these labour camps , the people who profited should be made pay the ladies still alive for their lost lives, The people who let it happen the Garda , the state , charities , society etc.However not knowing the full story but isn’t it likely that it was Etta’s grandparents that signed Margaret’s life away , probably with good intentions and society knew what was going on but choose to ignore the horrible treatment.Irish people have a certain way to deal with problems it’s happening all around us even today with our treatment of people or even animals. We will be feigning shock in years to come but we know
 The Catholic Church is responsible for so many blighted lives over the years, an evil organisation who still have not paid the survivors what is due to them.
 salves pure and simple and digusting
 the Catholic Church is not better than ISIS! The only difference is that the Catholic terror is more subtle and generally accepted by the public!
 slaves
 it’s easy to blame the church. Irish society was to blame. There would have been no laundries if parents wern’t so worried about what the neighbours would think and forcing their kids out of the home, sending the them off in fear. Some people had balls back then and stood up to that pressure.  But at the end of the day where would those girls have gone if there was no mother and baby homes. It is a sad reflection of ourselves and we cannot get away from it that easily by putting the full blame on the church.
 Garbage. The country was run from Rome, if people stood up to It they “disappeared” or were sent away. you seem naïve to the fact that the church controlled EVERYTHING
 dont be making excuses for despicable behaviour
 Making excuses? Would you ever cop on, the RCC got away with their behaviour because “respectable” Irish people let them get away with it.
Spending her entire life in a laundry and yet was the mother of 3 children..serious hidden secrets in our country. Who fathered all these babies of all these vulnerable women? They didn’t have the freedom to pursue romantic relationships yet time and time again they conceived children. I know the church held so much power over communities but how were more questions not asked. It’s barbaric.
 people didn t want the spotlight on them in any way its what you d expect from children we re still an immature society as its still going on
 anyone who asked questions ended up behind bars or gone missing or faced ridicule in their communities
@Sinead Boland After reading/researching about the laundries I found  it was often the priests that were involved with the laundries that continually raped these poor women that impregnated them. What these poor women/children went through on a daily basis was horrific
I feel sick after reading this,,, a totally heartless cloak of secrecy by the religious orders , This mothers life was hard enough without be reduced to a commodity of the Nuns for their sole gain and profit .
 This was run to get money to provide food, heating doctors etc for the babys and mothers. It was hard for everyone in those days e.g. The tenements, the young men being killed in war by their thousands. The laundries did that and were did not make ‘huge profits’ actually barley broke even. No one in those days including the nuns had any money despite endless letters to the government for more money. Should they have not worked and expect the nuns to feed their babies #loavesdandfishes. Don’t forget these were the one holding the babies as they died from Pneumonia, Diphtheria, typhoid, Dysentery, Polio, Mumps, Rubella becaule of infected water systems, and malnourishment, cofirmed by doctors death certificates etc.
Hang on here.These comments here are awful.It’s not those girls fault one bit.Nor was it poor margarets either.It was the states fault entirely.And I hope they get compensated for it.Horrific story and so so sad.Unforgivable.
 it was the fault of the Catholic Church in collusion with the State.
 don’t forget about the horrible Catholic Church!
 I am heartbroken for these girls and for their mother. And horrified but not surprised by the apologists and staunch defenders of the church and state who always seem to jump into these stories with their victim blaming. These girls and their mother are each victims of a cruel regime and the girls are absolutely right to seek compensation for the cruelty, institutionalisation, and death of Margaret, on her behalf. I don’t think it’s about money. The nuns certainly profited from Margaret’s labour. This is about addressing a gross wrongdoing.
The full story is not above.  I read it all some years ago.  Margaret was born to a mother who herself was incarcerated in a hospital.  Margaret was only 2 years old when she was put in Magdalene Laundry Yes 2, TWO years old.  When the Nuns were asked once how did Margaret get pregnant seeing that she had NEVER been free.  One of their stories was that they had taken the girls on an outing to Wicklow and a shopkeeper dragged Margaret behind the counter and raped her.  When did the Nazi Nuns ever take children or young girls/women out on an outing.  Margaret had two pregnancies, one with the twins as stated above and another girl.Poor dear Margaret kept ringing asking could she come and live with them and she would look after them all now that the adopted Mom had died.  Margaret just wanted to be out free and with her children.  I think it was Samantha who picked up the phone and rang the Nuns, Margaret’s Jailers, and told them that the family was going through a grieving process and could they stop Margaret from phoning them for a while. There were no further calls.  Margaret died within one year. Incarcerated since she was 2 years old…two pregnancies..I have heard of other pregnancies by Laundery Women who were never “outside” or allowed to talk to a man.  I have often wondered did the Magdalene Laundery & Industrial School Nuns pimp out their slaves…God Rest you in His arms you dear dear Lady Margaret…
Middle of the article refers to “Margaret Long” – typo surely as “Long” appears to be the adoptive surname of Margaret Bullen’s twin daughters?
Kappa, what else is there when everything else was controlled and taking away from the victims only money.The victims see it as someone has to pay for the hurt caused to them, their Mother and other victims of the Laundrys. The victims worked hard with no pay, they are now fighting for justice nothing can bring back or undo what they went through.But they are entitle to compensation.
I was saddened and angered in equal measure by reading that story.  The Ireland I grew up in looks completely different now I know what it was really like.  A cruel and mean-spirited place.  And it still is a cruel and mean-spirited place judging by some of the comments here.  The State crushes the life and spirit of an unfortunate woman, and all some people can speak about, and with not a trace of empathy, is how they think the the two innocent daughters should have behaved, and casting cruel aspersions on  their motives for highlighting this story.  Like you all know how two daughters stolen from their mother should be after 29 years apart.  Shame on you.
This was slavery pure and simple.
Sadly some of the surviving magdalen  woman are still under the “care” of the nuns  though it’s now run under the guise of a charity.Its state funded which means we are still funding repressive religious institutions and these poor elderly women are completely institutionalized because they have never had free will to do anything . And unfortunately if any of them are able to apply for redress(most can’t because they can’t read or write )any money received  will probably go right back to the religious “charity ” that has kept locked up all their lives .
Irish people should never forget the horror of these labour camps , the people who profited should be made pay the ladies still alive for their lost lives, The people who let it happen the Garda , the state , charities , society etc.However not knowing the full story but isn’t it likely that it was Etta’s grandparents that signed Margaret’s life away , probably with good intentions and society knew what was going on but choose to ignore the horrible treatment.Irish people have a certain way to deal with problems it’s happening all around us even today with our treatment of people or even animals. We will be feigning shock in years to come but we know
Maybe I missed something here, but why did this lady have to continue living in the laundry, even after she met her daughters!! Basically she was kept a prisoner by them so called Nuns!
 She didnt have to continue to stay these, she could have left! She was not a prisoner!
@kappa,Read the article and try to understand what’s been said!
it is so easy to blame the church and nunsit was not the nuns are priests who forcedthem in but society.if the nuns did not take them inthey would be on the side of the road or worse.the nuns took in what the familys and society rejectedhow many young mothers felt the love and compassionthat the familys did not give.i am part of the roman catholic churchtake the log out of your own eye.before you see the splinterin your brothers.jim
 so what your saying is that forcing women into concentration camp -like facilities where they were forced to hard labour without compensation, robbed of their children who were then sold to the US and physically and emotionally abused was an act of mercy by the church and the nuns?????If that was true then surely Hitler built the concentration camps to protect the Jews and the Brits starved the Irish to death for their own good?You are a pathetic little man and should be ashamed of yourself!
 No one forced them in!
Caused by the way she was treated???
Religion is poison
Margaret Bullen had nothing inHER handbag and she was an Irish citizen! SHAME ON IRELAND!
No reason to.Why would we needlessly antagonise another country and try to create trouble for ourselves?I think he’s a very poor leader but he’s US President.
 plus we have invited worse !!!! China comes to mind !!!
 we would be foolish not to continue our relationship with the US. He won’t be there forever.
 spot on. No need to uninvite anyone. Talking is always better.
 I don’t think he is .
Good, he should come here.  US is very important to us.
The Don is a friend to Ireland, the day that we don’t accept or invite a US president here is the day we need our collective heads examined.
Be staggering if he did considering how deeply we are in hock to US corporations.Anyway, really looking forward to the Leftie meltdown.
 Awww,you’re so edgy ! Love it!
 nice to know you support all his policies. Got it.
Is Leo the biggest spoofer FG ever had as leader ?It’s a YES from me
Who in their right mind would uninvite the president of the USA.?Disagree with office holder as much as you want. But the office is a shining light to the world, Ireland cannot afford to besmirch one of its main allies.
Brace yourselves. The Trump Derangement Syndrome sufferers are coming.
 the only ones moaning are you guys!
Well it seems for all the media hype about our new Taoiseach he is no different from his predecessor. Plus ça change etc.
The US is most important trading partner we have. According to the OEC Ireland exports more to the US than the next two EU countries on the list combined. Why would any Irish leader sacrifice the close ties we have with our strongest ally
Only the left-wing Irish media would want to rescind an invitation for a State visit to Ireland by the President of the United States, not the Irish people.
Leo has chosen reasoned discussion over emotional hysterics. Well done Leo.
 You mean the emotional hysterics from Trump if we were to rescind his invitation?
  No Leo would be instigator in that instance.
Without the US there would be no Ireland.
 Better learn your history . Without Ireland there would be no US
Symbiotic.
Ireland needs the US and the UK no matter the politics. You can’t eat morals
I wonder has Leo put a few thousand euros aside for the influx of the 5-10 people that will be deported in the next decade or so from the US..
 5-10 people doesn’t seem a lot!
 where did je mention any nationality? By the way, congratulations on account number 71
 Yup!
Of course Leo won’t because he is Flip Flopper in Chief.
I don’t think Trump will come unless he thinks we all plan to fawn over him, which I sincerely hope most Irish people won’t.
No reason to make a headline out of Trump coming to Ireland, afterall he owns property here. What would happen if the taoiseach didn’t get an invite to America for St.Patricks Day celebrations.
Of couse he’d like Trump to come. He’ll get a big thrill out of it !
 because…?
 because of same reason he got a thrill from meeting May and all the pompus officialdom and attention he got from it.
Trump does not give 2f’s about Ireland. Lets get him here and let our feelings known.
Saudi Arabia invited him, it is enough Cash for him and Israel.
Sure Leo can look Trump in the eye and say “nah nah nah my pay packet is bigger than yours”
So Enda Kenny insulted Donald Trump publicly and our new Taoiseach said he would not invite President Trump to Ireland. Are all Taoiseachs idiots now determined to undermine the National Interest so to look popular repeating media friendly sound bites? Depressing.
One egotist meets another
This guy is full of poop
This pig is not wanted in Europe
Leo your the man a pure leader a long time since we had one strong enough great forward thinking manGreat work
Should we not be looking at who is most suitable to the position rather than appoint someone based on gender for the sake of it
 We should, which is why it’s both surprising and disappointing that there aren’t more women at senior level.
 who do you recommend exactly and why would they be better than anyone else?
 Do you feel that the selections represent the best we have?
 best of a bad bunchCan you name the women who should be there any why they should be there over anyone else?
 I wouldn’t pick any of them, male or female. I don’t vote FG or FF. Statistically speaking though, if you are to pick people based on ability alone you would expect the gender balance of the cabinet to equal the gender balance of the pool of candidates.
 OK so you’re not aware of any other women who would be suitable candidates.
 That’s not what I said and you’re avoiding my point with a personalised request. I don’t rate any of the not-selected woman higher than the selected men. My actual point: I don’t rate any of the selected men higher than the not-selected women. I don’t rate any of them, male or female. The gender balance should  represent the pool it came from. If it doesn’t, something else is at play.
 No, you are avoiding an answer by not naming possible candidates. By saying that the gender balance should be the same as the pool to choose from is a simplification of the problem. And by not naming a candidate you are proving yourself wrong.
 Answer a question with a question, slither around and don’t answer a very simple question based on your own assertion.Bluffer Peter -
 What was the gender balance of the pool of candidates?
 The best mates they have more like.
 if that was the case the place would be empty.
 Yes. Let’s start doing than then.
How O Connor even gets close to the cabinet table is a mystery.
 She has a lot of drive but has come down the steps a bit.
 that was fantastic
Shur we all know Leo ain’t into women
 He’ll be worse than -Yiann- -Yia- -Milo- – just wait!
Joan stop giving women a bad name. It’s all about quality not quantity.
Not much of it on display from any of the choices, tbh.
 absolutely correct. It’s about talent. Choose the best talent. I’d have no bother in the world if it was 80% women and 20% men if the 80 were the best choices. If anything Joan is actually embarrassing women saying they should be there to make up numbers and balance it out. Quality not quantity
Cos joan was so good when she was a minister.  Mmoc was demoted because of her lack of competence no other reason.
 Joan burton is a has been, when she was in government she didn’t do very well & is best forgotten, she has cost the state large amounts of money because of this so called kidnapping which was a laugh & a complete waste of time & money
Wake up iJoan. By all accounts mitchell-oconnor was struggling in her role. Roles should be awarded on ability not gender not geography
 Completely agree. By all accounts she wasn’t very good at her role so why keep her. Im all for equality but thats just common sense!
 If they were only chose on their ability only we would have no ministers at all but genders should be scrapped before those in Clonskeagh try to take advantage of it.
Jan and Joan the Quota Queens.Capability doesn’t matter to the “J”s, just gender.As long a female is steering the Titanic they are happy.
 it’s pathetic
LOL…Mary Mitchell O’Connor and higher education in the same sentence…you really couldn’t make this $hit up.
Surely gender should be irrelevant. Mary Mitchell O’Connor was sh!t at her job. That’s what’s relevant. If you’re sh!t at your job, you’ll get the sack. Why should TD’s be any different?
What about all the other genders!
Why do women do this to themselves?  Wanting a woman in a job for the mere fact she is a woman is so counterproductive to their cause.  If you came up with actual reasons why someone is more qualified to be in a position and did not get it then it would look less like demanding special treatment and people would be outraged.  Insisting these high governmental jobs should be given to some women just results in lipservice being paid and completely undermines actually strong intelligent women who do get into high power jobs based on their ability and hard work.
 I completely agree with you, it’s counteractive to feminism.
Super junior minister! Really where do they get the titles… Whats next? Wouldn’ mind but there’s nothing super about any of them except in their own eyes… Aa for gender balance I’m all for one less actually…..Burton a complete waste of space!!
 Super Junior was invented to keep Pat Rabbitte happy during the Rainbow Coalition- there always room for a eunuch at the table
 in case you are not aware this super junior has been around a while
 tx for that!  Either way waste if space still stands! Jobs for the boys….or women in this case
Stop the lights there’s 1 less woman, this is a travesty, women should mobilise and protest immediately, Go feminists…
“At a time when we should be promoting women”???? Isn’t that sexism. So basically a better candidate (in this case male because that’s what was chosen) should lose out to a woman. Yep, that’s sexism.
Enda promoted mmoc to jobs minister in order to shoehorn another women into the cabinet.  Its just a pity he didn’t choose the right woman as she was out of depth in the role and she could not see her own incompetence which made it embarrassing for all concerned.
“There are now three women ministers – Heather Humphreys, Katherine Zappone, Regina Doherty – and one super junior minister, Mary Mitchell O’Connor”Emmn Francis Fitzgerald?
 what ministries does Fitzgerald have. Her record in justice was a disgrace.
 She’s been moved to Enterprise. agree wouldn’t rate her at all for Justice.
 Any idea why she’s still Tánaiste?
  Haven’t a clue. Way beyond my pay scale :-)
 or Enterprise for that matter. She wears glasses to hide her lies.
I thought there were no genders now.
Moan moan moan.
So what she got demoted? It most probably wasn’t a gender based decision. Generally cabinet reshuffles are about rewarding loyalty, and perhaps they just did not have the best relationship with Leo to begin with. I dislike it all coming down to gender. Again, it’s the evil men controlling it all. I’ll
There are four female ministers and one super junior. She forgot Frances Fitzgerald.
Joan , hated by most , every little helps …
Burton has done untold damage to the cause for women, a vile creature to say the least
What is a “super junior” minister and what do they do? They all look quite old to me!!
 they wear a cape and go around saying “have you switched it off and back on again? Maybe try that?”…..
Dose anyone really care what Burton has to say and labour more so,do they not realise Labour are finished and it’s all thanks to her and the rest of them who were such a shambles,sick of hearing her and labour still getting their one cent in cause no one cares what they have to say anymore
Joan was a pretty poor minister when she was there herself.
One advantage of having a gay man as Taoiseach I suppose is that the feminazi have to bite their hairy lips for fear of being labelled homophobic.
 maybe he makes six females
It’s not over yet. Female Attorney General and Garda Commissioner likely to be replaced by males. The Chief Justice is due to retire sometime soon. Chances that she will be replaced by another woman are remote. It’s nearly over for the women in senior positions.
 they could put Josephine Feehily in one of these positions.
You post made absolutely no sense. Are you saying certain ministerial positions should be filled based on how attractive the Taoiseach finds the candidate? Is this the limit of your knowledge of a selection process… Have you been watching Mad Men?
Super junior minister…??? Never heard of that position
Sure isnt Leo a Big girl.
Regina Doherty and empty vessels strike a remarkable similarity.
Not a great day for men,dogs,birds,etc,,, either
Regina Doherty being in cabinet is a slap on the face to taxpayers ..women and men.Joan is no great ad for women in politics either.
Unlike the men that totally denominate Journal.ie, Women account for half of the Irish Population ~ therefore half of the cabinet should be women. Men don’t occupy most higher positions because of talent, it’s because it’s a boys club – all commenters who say otherwise are in denial and, in my humble opinion, quite the ‘sado’ as the kids do say
 it doesn’t take you to be very bright to understand that, when such a small proportion of TDs are women, it would be hugely unbalanced for women to occupy half thr cabinet seats..
 Exactly – not only the cabinet Daffy, we should apply it to all levels of politics! Women aren’t being given fair opportunities at all levels. It’s time for change. I’m with ya!
A super junior position? One unnecessary and tiresome adjective there
Another stupid comment by Bruton
 that’s BURTON.
Heard Leo’s father being interviewed on RTE. When asked what political hopes he had for his son’s tenure as Taoiseach he replied:‘I hope he looks after the poor and the vulnerable in Irish society’Father – know thy son.
The homeless and those in deadend shorterm unsecure HAP are going to be moved left right and centre by this all over the place Taoiseach
poor Mary Mitchell O Connor-What will she do now for attention -She will have to drive down the steps again.
 Still in the cabinet.
Kenny used her. Now she will have to suck it.
 only one demoted.
 sure enough Christy-Her face was was in front of every camera when ever Fine Gael claimed to be giving out one of those five eight jobs-you would nearly think she actually owned the company’s that were dishing them out.
It was vomit inducing to watch the td’s scurrying into getting their big bums on their seats in the dail today, reminded me of the look you see on kids faces when they win a seat playing musical chairs! & as for Coveney been moved just before his deadline of July 2017 to look after the homeless!
Martin callinan was the story of the day.
 Did the Journal actually cover that? I haven’t seen an article on it here..
 look again
 Fair enough, my bad.
 I thought that it was the fire of London, such a tragedy and one wonders could it happen here and how would the emergency services handle it.Well done to the London fire service, medics, police and local communities for offering their support to the victims.
Musical chairs and no one to blame for new ministerial positions …. Housing from scratch again … Joke …
Still be Frankfurt’s way, whatever happens?
Copying Macroon in France except we have known him for ten years and aren’t buying it!!!
 Macron
Whatever about FG Choirboys, at least they take their seats to engage fully in the democratic process.Contrast that with SF, which persists with the 19th century abstentionist policy towards Westminster, having had 7 MPs elected last week.Political eunuchs, toeing an Ard- Comhairle line which is completely at odds with the need for their constituents to have the strongest representation at this time.Are they seriously leaving it to the DUP to make “our ” Brexit case in the British Parliament?Pragmatic politics is what is required, not ancient dogma.
 But Sinn Fein won all nationalist seats in the north on an abstentionist ticket so do not have a mandate to take their seats in westminster.
 The Constituants MUST agree with them since they continue to vote for them knowing what their policy is in advance…
Big deal, Gerry was doing stretches before Leo.
 And would be doing a long stretch by now, if it wasn’t for his political contacts.
Thought it was Waterford whispers I was reading for a sec!
Big Phil Hogan was his advisor on placements. Strawberry Beds in Castleknock was the “secret” venue. Phil loves a jar and talks very loudly.
Spellcheck your sub-headline, FFS. Amateurs.
I suppose he cudnt be worse than the usless bollicks he replaced
 he could. He could up or taxes, create more jobs for the bhoys, and the stasi ahemm I mean garda anything to be done about them?
Cant be any worse than whats gone before.Good luck to him
Wants to unite the country – be careful what you wish for Mr Varadkar
I DON’T TRUST HIM AT ALL AND I AM NOT BUYING HIS STUFF!  TOOK HIM AAAAAGESS TO COME OUT.
#notmytaoiseach
Ah Leo, Ireland’s answer to Theresa May, so many similarities!
Leo the not one more red cent liar ..
 is there any chance that we can put up an article with Ireland’s national debt during Enda and Noonan’s stint in office? The one that’s gone from €65b to €185b, not the leprechaun economics one.
 is there any chance that we can put up an article with Ireland’s national debt during Enda and Noonan’s stint in office? The one that’s gone from 65b to 185b, not the leprechaun economics one.
Leo’s doing fair well for himself….the other half is well easy on the eye!!! Michael Martin’s son is the same. Not a thing wrong with him. I obviously care more about politics than aesthetics but it does help….
Can’t seem to warm to Leo,at all.Comes across a bit of a smarmy,smug know-it-all,to me anyway.That smile is about as genuine as a hookers orgasm.I would have much preferrred Simon Coveney but alas we are where we are.
I like Leo. Wish him well.
 interesting that you know him.
 well surely that could strengthen their opinion no?
Don’t trust him…too far right for the good of this country and is a new breed  of politician who will inflict their policies. Him and Pascal in finance does not bode well for this country…at all
 somebody has to pay the taxes
 it sure won’t be multinational corporations or vulture funds paying taxes, with Leo in charge
  Leo is about as right wing as Lenin.
A committed far right neoliberal. If you thought Kenny and Noonan were bad. You haven’t seen anything yet.
 I bet you are wrong on that one. His record in social protection doesn’t indicate he will do anything significant
 Ah Dave. Give him a chance.He’s appointed Eoghan Murphy, his campaign manager, to Housing. Expect an announcement of massively increased Social Housing budget soon.Mind you, Regina Doherty taking over Social Protection doesn’t exactly give you a warm fuzzy feeling…..
 Time will tell Brinster.If he manages to get something positive and meaningful done re social housing, i will give credit where it is due.Seen on the Hub Ireland FB page the front cover of a bill for “Mortgage to rent” legislation to come before the Dail.According to the Hub Ireland this is the way those in mortgage arrears are going to be dealt with. I wouldn’t think this is a very positive step.https://www.facebook.com/irishselfhelpzone/photos/rpp.186111024879020/817872558369527/?type=3&theater
 His “Rat for Leo” campaign was very significant.
 “Far Right” Lolz. He’s more left wing than Bernie Sanders.  In fact, there isn’t that much difference between him and Jezzer Corbyn.
 Has John McGuinness name on it – he’s FF isn’t he? Would need more detail before inmplications are knownThought it was positive that Varadkar specifically mentioned that he was considering a vacant premises tax.He acknowledged the timeline for Social Housing wasn’t quick enough.Use the “rainy day” fund I say.For health and housing, the rainy day has been here for seven years…
Delighted for him, imagine all the years he’ll have on a Taoiseachs pension.
Young FGers quick fingered?
As far as I’m aware ministers pensions now only kick in at 66 or thereabouts, a change brought in by the last government.
 about time really don’t know of another job where you can get a pension early
 Prison officer, teacher, garda, defence forces to name a few!
 All defined contribution pensions- most only stipulate that employer contributions cannot be taken until you are 5 years in the scheme. When you leave your job, your pension is yours, no matter how young you are. Most people transfer it to their next job/pension fund to protect it from tax liability. Only at 65 can you take a lump sum tax free, while putting the remainder into an annuity
Who would feel good about someone with no mandate to be Leader becoming one by default total joke he has being useless in all the ministries he has had cannot stand the man
 who has a mandate?
 kind of the point Paul isn’t it? I think it should be an election when the leader of the country steps down.
“His first job as leader was to form his new Cabinet.”He didn’t form a new cabinet he just reappointed the same old suspects from Enda’s cabinet. Meaning don’t expect any changes. Steady as we go cabinet until we get the pension as ministers…….
 sober up you idiot. He did make changes and even if he didn’t that doesn’t make the statement incorrect. We seriously need a cull in this country
I never felt worse about a new Taoiseach.  His attitude is typical for a young-ish careerist, who was lucky enough that his life got never struck by any great misfortune.  If he loves ‘people who get up early in the morning’ so much (as he stresses every other day or so), I hope one day he may learn that there are also people in this world who CANnot get up – not because they sleep off their hangover, but because they may be too sick or old or handicapped or depressed.  But it seems, in his view they are all just social welfare fraudsters…
 Its absolutley astonishing that those who cant get up early in the morning, like those who you mentioned above get the same benefits as those who simply wont get up to work or find a job. Those with genuine disability, that prevents them from working, should be given a living wage by the state.Those that simply wont work, re-train etc should be cut. It should not be the responsibility of the tax payer to fund lifestyles for those who suffer from chronic laziness. I was one of those people for a few years and one can live a comfortable life on 188 living at home. Living on the dole should not be comfortable.Now a few years on working full time, paying rent and back loans from re-training, I am actually worse off than my days on the dole. Income has gone up but so have out goings and tax cuts for those of us who do indeed rise at 6 am and may not see home again until near 8 in the evening should be top of the agenda. By giving the worker more take home pay and cutting those who are lazy, while looking after the sick, will in turn reap far more benefits long term
I understand what you say and I agree; presently there is too little incentive to take up work when you can.  There would be better ways of calculating benefits and taxes, which protects those without work while still rewarding work.  (I am thinking of the ‘basic income’ system, though the term is rather misleading.)However I do feel very bad about the attitude I sense behind Leo’s statements.  Social security has its faults and problems, but I don’t want it demolished and live in the 19th century again.
Shower of FG licks or liers that result
 No need for grammar nazis
 You are being Pedantic so
 you are really really angry about this aren’t you? Have you thought of taking an extended holiday for a while? This stress can’t be good for you
 Well atleast you are not a shameless Leo fan so we friends
 Leo and FG have ensured no one can afford a holiday but if you offering thanks as getting off this island would do the majority despairing citizens the world of good literally
 Nazis not nazi’s
 *Nazis
 the only notable thing I can think of that Leo did recently was try and stamp out welfare fraud- which I’m sure everyone would agree with. Plus that would only affect a tiny proportion of the population anyway.I think the majority can probably afford a holiday but even if you can’t then you could look at options like volunteering in refugee camps or something. Set up a go fund me…. I would support that
 Nazis is plural. …
“How do you feel about Leo Varadkar being Taoiseach?”  Probably be a more valid question to ask after the country’s had another year of his party’s fraud, deceit and corruption. Just another liar to represent the agenda of the privileged few, just like FF.
Couldn’t give a s**t should be an option also
Disappointed already.. Varadkar said  he wanted to increase capital spending in areas like transport,  education and other areas.Why then,  didn’t he get rid of Ross..?
If he wasn’t such a raging right winger, it would be a cause for celebration.  He’s Taoiseach in spite of his heritage and sexuality and because of demonising welfare recipients and before that, making contribution to the complete balls up of the HSE.
 He demonised welfare recipients? When?All I saw was him demonising welfare cheats…
I wish the new young Taoiseach well!Hopefully, he can visit his father’s homeland, India, on a trade mission fairly soon and encourage Investment and tourism from there into Ireland.Leo is India’s JFK. Great story for the 1.3 billion natives!
Way to far right. Divisive in his approach to politics. Not good for the country.
His reign will be short ☺️
Pessimistically optimistic.
Form and appearance prevails over substance.It is silly to assert that there is no right and no left.
 Whingers would normally be found in the corner of a bar in other times but the Journal provides a public service in promoting you to the pulpits of society.  The Irish population have ,by and large, managed to avoid a left or right ideology that plagues this era as individuals are not easily pigeon holed or forced to conform to blanket views like labour and the conservatives are in the UK, in other words we are comfortable with a balance. People who vote for same gender marriage may not be comfortable with abortion, people who make allowances for the good in tradition don’t  go berserk once the Church or government are mentioned  while recognizing change is always necessary .
 this is a conservative country. There is nothing wrong with that. Why can’t our two conservative parties just admit what they are. People of the gaels,soldier of destiny, we are selves,  sadly mean nothing. Time for tds to stop acting like the local chieftain and stand on principle.
  The republicans and democrats in the States are a conservative/liberal split but their dialogue is polarizing and doesn’t lend itself to a balance of political power which sometimes requires adopting agile positions which suits a small country in a creative and productive way.  We might care about pollution but not about the bandwagon of ‘climate change’ whereas I can tell what party an American belongs to by their views on that matter.
 You are a wise and intelligent man.
Varadkar will be found out soon enough. He’s failed in every single portfolio handed to him – this will be no different. If we had a press in this country that didn’t consist of O’Briens hacks & soft touch fanboys – Varadkar would be eaten alive. Call a GE – we dare you!
Ground breaking statistical awareness will be pulled out of this one. Next up what does the colour purple smell like A. Good B. Bad
A Chinese leader was asked what did he think of the outcome of the French Revolution and he said ‘ it’s too soon to tell
When the correct answer was ‘a catastrophe from beginning to end’.
The problem is, ‘Stupid’ is a subject studied widely in schools and universities. Every year that goes by, people are graduating in ‘Stupid’ and we are all going to hell in a handcart because we keep voting for Stupid careerist politicans – not people with leadership, vision or experience..
There wasn’t a button for “I don’t care” so couldn’t vote. Nothing against Varadkar it’s just that the political system is redundant. It doesn’t matter who the messenger is, the message is the same. Invisible actors run the show.
He is too right wing for me as is FG.
He’s the same as the rest of the parasitic leeched, snouts in the trough, right wing who will carry on the same shameful legacy as Kenny
 obviously most thinking people don’t agree
Leo will look after the rich like his other cronies in power while the working class and poor continue to suffer to try buy their own homes and house the homeless!!
I thought this poll was going to be :Poll: How happy are you about Leo Varadkar being Taoiseach?Pretty happy?Very happy?Extremely happy?
Different PR face – same party that has back-stabbed a nation of people.
I like Leo. But he seems to be to busy chasing welfare fraud and nothing bout the likes of seanie fitz, the real gangsters
Wish him the best but fear the worst!
It’s not about personal likes or dislikes!He is properly elected by FG, so lands in pole position as Taoiseach to undertake his ” principled politics”, etc.Well, he has 2 years to turn the boat around from the unprincipled conduct of the last 2 FG dominated regimes.May I propose that he includes the “restoration” ,to use public service language, of the permanent lifetime cuts to private pensions that remain in place after the departure of M. “Levy” Noonan.Wouldn’t that be very principled? & just? &fair?
just a bunch of old self serving cronies listed in the ministerial roles…wheres the modernity or even decency
I like LV but surely to god its the people of the country should vote for who leads the country not his own friends and work mates.
50%??The resident outraged on here are not going to like that!It’s a fix! It’s been hacked! Frapper room etc.
Jobs for the boys… Don’t expect any changes… Same shit different day
Suicidal.
dont like him too slick, im sure there all happy nice big pensions for them
I see young FG were busy this morning.
Liked him until he said Frances Fitzgerald is doing a good job . It’s just more of the same
Trade mission to Saudi.
Beware of Beardies bearing false teeth,otherwise enjoy the position, the job and hopefully the results of good Governance.
This country badly needs a pro-business, pro-development and tax cutting agenda to counter balance the infantalised state of a large cohort of the Irish population that rely on the sugardaddy taxpayer as a child relies on its parents. I fear Leo may not be as effective as needed but he is at least a step in the right direction.
That’s the heart of the problem – it’s a too far right-wing direction.
We don’t have any right wing parties in this country. The choices range from centre left to loony far left.
 says a looney and extreme right winger.
 why are you speaking to yourself??
 there’s  7% unemployment rate. It’s merely 3% higher than the lowest it has ever been. The “infantilised” sector of the population as you put it need support and I have no quibble helping them out. Infinitely better than the American policy of donating food stamps to large swathes of the population who are burning the candle at both ends to try and make ends meet. All this while a vast sector of the wealth is concentrated about perfidious families like the Roth child’s and Trump’s.
 yep the banking sector is run by money lefties who expect handouts and 10 years later are even more inefficient – losing mortgage application, sending out the wrong offer 4 times. Delays etc. – well they certainly act like they’re operating in 1960s Russia.Yep the looney left is alive and well. Zero competition and billions of handouts..
 7% is 75% more than 4%.
 What you just said the country needs is exactly what the country has been feeding to its detriment. We need to impose more taxes on the well off businesses and the rich and the corporations.
 The comments here are beneath contempt. The same old looney left jibe from sick people who love to deny rights to those who entitled to them. Rights are Justice. Rights are what the people of Ireland have enshrined in the constitution. That includes a home an income and health. The far right like Varadkar and his Ilk will pay dearly for targeting the ordinary people with vilification. The people will remove them. Its that simple.
 That is a false manipulated unemployment figure based on massaged figures doctored for political reasons. The real figure is about 15 per cent.
 and who will be put in? And how will they make things better? Tax the rich? Shake the magic money tree? Launder fuel?
Fred Jensen, you must be a descendant of Trevelyan.
 there has been a 75% reduction in unemployment levels since last year. Down from 8.4% to 6.4%. I overestimated the unemployment figures by .6%. This was not the purpose of my comment.  I merely wanted to highlight that a very small percentage of our population  need social welfare assistance. Would prefer by far to help them than the banking sectors that overstretched their mark on futures in Anglo etc etc etc
@Fred Jensen and it never rains in this country either, correct? Why, also can you tell me is it ‘Loony’ to be a socialist???? Sounds loony to me that you would just slur certain politicians with that name merely because you disagree with their social based agenda!?
 They thought that in US, and look what they got, only saying.
 Don’t kid yourself. They are all puppets with the same agenda, its all a show to keep you distracted.
 yes why don’t you blame the less well off in our Country – while paying over all your hard earned money to the EU, IMF and all the lovely banker that go off scot free and all those who the state owes money to after the collapse of the Country.  You are they kind of person Leo will love for his welfare cheat programme, I’d say you would shop your own mother. You would expect the most vulnerable in our society such as the disable to crawl to a job, however we are so lucky that we have more decent human beings in this Country than the likes of you.
@fredjensonFred,  what can I say?  Last week you were promoting “apartheid” between the haves and have nots. You say we don’t have right wing politics? What kind of reality do you actually live in? Please answer my questions this time. Snob.
The Tory Taoiseach :(
 just like your own prime minister so.
Was Leo against gay marriage a few years ago like Enda? Why was he in the closet so long?
Mr Veradker needs to remember that the public didn’t vote for him to be Taoiseach.
 Under our Constitution, that would be impossible~¡~
 Under our Constitution, that would be impossible~¡~
when did we ever vote for a Taoiseach?The Dáil always votes for a Taoiseach
 the Irish public haven’t been given the opportunity to give their verdict on FG with Varadkar as leader.
2017. The year Ireland got it’s first openly classist Taoiseach.Just remember leo, you’re the Taoiseach for ALL citizens, including the ones you use to score tawdry political points with.
 he’ll be delighted with the advice, jam m8…
Leo hated Enda for the last 7 years to the day & was one of the main FG frontbenchers who lead the heave against Enda. The fake praise to Enda is so disingenuous & himself & Simon had no backbone to get rid of Enda since the 2016 election.
A dark day for Ireland
 Please explain?
 want to give some insight there?? Troll!!
FFS ! All the fuss, pretence and nonsensical carry on in the Dail yesterday and more of the same today ! Humiliating stuff. More important things happening in the world.
ENJOY THE honeymoon leo it wont last long
One great thing to come out of this is that people in the comments section might finally shut up about Enda for five seconds!
Fred Jensen38mins agoThis country badly needs a pro-business, pro-development and tax cutting agenda to counter balance the infantalised state of a large cohort of the Irish population that rely on the sugardaddy taxpayer as a child relies on its parents. I fear Leo may not be as effective as needed but he is at least a step in the right direction.Some people are just plain Dumb ,  60 billion we gave banks, Apple owes us 14 billion, the only way we could get more pro business is to start offering them hand jobs…. and this guy would rather we leave our poor sink or swim.  some people are just really dumb..
 The person you quoted is obviously mentally challenged being so brainwashed.
 Fred is a long time FG troll. Don’t feed the trolls.
I definitely don’t envy that man. He’s taking over a country with a lot of problems and in the eyes of many he can do no right. Doubt he will last long.
Is he? Jaysus I hadn’t heard about this at all..
Ok, what the fudge is wrong with these gombeens going after Leo for his welfare cheats campaign ? Like i said before, how can anyone justify someone FRAUDENTLY claiming something they are NOT entitled to ???
 How can someone harp on about something that has nothing to do with the problems we face. Its like swatting a fly while the country burns. Cop on and grow up. Change the record. No one believe the lies.
It turns my stomach to see what is happening in the Dail. It is sickening to see the elite pat each other on the back while the people of Ireland live in misery and poverty. The Capitalist exploitation of neo liberalism is destroying our people. The speeches in the Dail are a victory for the well off and the elite. Its a day of mourning for the ordinary man and woman of Ireland suffering under the greed of these politicians.
A sad for Ireland!
 hand on your hips, give it a push
Bashir?
As Scrooge said “I see a crutch in the corner with no owner” that will be Leo crutch as this will all end in tears. Too many people left behind and starving. Leo speech has no vision, no plan and certainly nothing different from the last leader. New leader same policy.
So Boyd Barrett thinks it’s wrong to target welfare cheats. It’s damn right. How can anyone justify paying fraudster ? As for whomever voted for this Coppinger muppet needs their heads checked
 The problem is making it seem like welfare fraud is a rampant problem. I don’t remember it exactly, but there was something like 10 incidents of it last year.
 ok Eamonn, i take your point. Still it’s 10 cases too many. Someone else is losing out as a result of another claiming fraudulently.
#leo reiterates that he will be Taoiseach of “a republic of opportunity, where everybody has a FAIR chance”. Surely therefore, SURELY he means he’ll repeal #FEMPI & stop robbing our children for banks’ social welfare?Maybe he means to return to his 2011 “not another red cent” promise and seek a write down of the Odious Depth illegally foisted upon our generations by his predecessors?“Opportunity” and “Fair” surely cannot mean doing anything else.
 *Debt. Feckonomics and autocorrect, eh? Bad mix…
Don’t expect any great change since he announced that Frances Fitzgerald is doing a good job .   More of the same . I suspect that like Enda he’s just in it for the foto opportunities
Fred Jensen:any chance you could stop talking BS , 60 billion we gave banks, 14 billion apple owes us, our farmers are on 23.000 a year, if you believe that your dumber than I thought,   your problem is we look after our poor?   Tax cuts….  how about just collecting taxes fairly , ie apple.
 then Apple leave followed by the rest of the multi nationals and we are back to being raped by priests.
The coronation of the blue queen has provided Richard Posner with stiff competition
Danny Healy Rae for Taoiseach.
Forget about Leo coming in……. Has Mr Nama Noonan departed yet??
One of the main problems our senior politicians have had is experience of this country, only. Few have ever worked abroad or were educated there – however, some of our public companies, like Bank of Ireland, are now looking further afield. Appointing the first female  CEO, with a considerable international background. Varadkar never left Dublin!
 think he might have a bit of the subcontinent experience in him.
 Only experience outside the Pale – a 6 month course in Washington. And now capable of running a European country¡¿
 the main problem with our politicians is the fact that they are teachers farmers and doctors and not actually politicians. Useless shower the lot of them.
There’s nothing wrong with being a party that represents people who get up early in the morning.  There, I said it.
  Very true. But is that a good description for Mr Varadkar? Only time will tell. And people who get up early in the morning to do what? That’s the question.
RIP Ireland.
We now live in a country where our very own Taoiseach is not allowed to donate blood.A lot more changes needed.
They are still Waffling!
How soon can we get rid of him?
These elected representatives are the worst I’ve seen giving speeches. They struggle with almost every fact in front of them. I guess it’s written by one of their staff, but how hard is it to familiarise yourself with information prior to a presentation.Elect inept people and you’ll have an inept government.
same sh!t,different EU puppet
 it has come to my attention that you were speaking to Fred Jensen.Can you please explain??????
Public don’t vote for the Taoiseach… Party on power elect a leader… That leader is usually Taoiseach
Yeah
Honestly I don’t mind this guy normally..but what a load of back slapping.. self congratulatory baloney. Just confirms that these people live in a Dail bubble. Speaking to each other rather than the electorate
What? Welfare cheats go camping?Don’t you just love the journals inability to spell.
T
More slime from blueshit  pond
 clever
Please see below what experts think they could’ve spent the money on.
 reducing our €200 billion national debt…
 Nah. I pay enough taxes for that. I want to go to a gallery and furnish my mind with beauty instead.
 Building a motorway between Cork and Limerick.
Pfft, what benefit would that bring to Dublin?
 Im with Meekus. Money well spent. Amazing museum.
6 years to do the job. That’s the Office of Public Works for you. Ah sure why rush, need that two hour lunch break and finish by 4:30 as per union “entitlements”.
 I contacted them 3 weeks ago to ask if the community group I’m with could clean up a protected structure in the area and if so, what rules would we need to follow. The reply was we will process your request, please allow 20 working days for a reply, contact us again if you haven’t heard back in that time
20 days…in the private sector if you left a customer hanging for 20 minutes you’d be fired.
 Talking of which, have you seen the gravy train at the bridge over the Dodder in Ballsbridge?Works for the boys on the riverbanks have been going on for 3 or 4 years now.Complete scam. Given to the highest bidder with the longest project duration who clearly must be handing back a few brown envelopes to the awardee in the council.
 you’ve never been on to three or virgin media so
So what art is going to be in it? Anything good
 didn’t you see the Turner prize – style installations in the photos? I thought the pile of builder’s rubble was especially eloquent about the Celtic Tiger, the collapse and the ghost estates.
 for a country out size we’ve a great selection of works
 In our collection we have Picasso, Van Gogh, Vermerr, Rembrandt and others, not to mention the Caravaggio and massive amount of Irish art. It is a world class collection.
Eejits. Why waste money?!!!
A man who promised so much & delivery nothing! So much for the “so called ” Contract” he signed With the people of Ireland, remember that one? think he broke every one of them! Lets face it , its all a con anyway, our so called government are themselves been governed
 A story involving Enda Kenny. Thumb fisher fishes for thumbs by commenting that       (A) He is in some way involved in corruption (not specific). Optional addition: He should be jailed        (B) He is doing and/or has done nothing or general negative things (not specific)   (C) You are delighted he his leaving        (D) He has been taking instructions from Germany/Merkel/EU. Optional addition: he will be getting some job from them      (E) He is getting a large pension (not specific)
  Yes a bit like the comment looney left. No substance.
His farewell was as inspiring as was his leadership, Lacking in substance.
 Yah, little style, and even less substance !
Thank **** he’s finally gone
 He only left through the door on the left but will be coming back in through the door on the right.   Just give him a few days to get over his hangover from the bar.
Good rithems to kenny . Clueless and not with reality & reality is poverty stillHigh despite so call recovery not to mention Health but most importantly infrastructure hasn’t really come along as they say it has . Kenny wasn’t the brains he had an advisor I’d say that where the brains were .leo will be interesting chapter but don’t foresee it lasting .
Fionnuala was certainly the power behind the throne. That dope wouldn’t find his shoes unless she put them in his hand.
He punched him on the shoulder to say thanks a mill for the unreal pension Hun!!! They are all corrupt and it’s never going to change
 They are all corrupt? I hope you have evidence of this and e reported to the Gardai. Or do you just find politicians abhorrent because you don’t really know what they do, but you know they get well paid for doing it. In your eyes, this makes them “corrupt”
God speed Mr Kenny.
 to hell
It’s definitely time to move on from the Enda Kenny era. In his choices for the new Cabinet, Taoiseach-elect Leo Varadkar must stay true to the refreshing and enterprising vision that he outlined and won the Fine Gael leadership campaign on. He must appoint a Minister for Finance who shares his vision for a growing Ireland, an Ireland where levels of marginal taxation do not exceed 50 per cent and where we actually invest in economic infrastructure. In other words, Leo Varadkar, unlike Enda Kenny (and his finance minister, Michael Noonan), must be a Taoiseach for the young people of Ireland. Also, Varadkar’s ministerial choices should not be dictated by such old-fashioned concerns as “regional considerations”, but by merit and a shared vision.Dr Varadkar must learn the lessons of the recent British general election (lessons which, judging by the tone of his leadership campaign, I think the Taoiseach-elect sensed before they were manifested across the Irish Sea). Young people in Britain rebelled against the establishment because they are locked out of the housing market and, even if a young person has a college degree these days, they still find it extremely difficult to access a mortgage. This is unlike previous generations, where a decent Leaving Certificate would usually be enough for a person or a couple to be able to acquire a mortgage to buy their first little house. Today this is not possible, unless a mortgage applicant works as a civil servant!Many young people today struggle to attain secure employment. This, in addition to not owning a house, means that they don’t feel that they have much of a stake in society and aren’t going to get very far. The scourge of zero-hours contracts has to be tackled, we must restore a prosperous, enterprising society where young people feel that they are moving upwards and have a real stake in society. This means that it should not be so hard to purchase a mortgage and access a decent-paying job with consistent hours.The above issues were never understood by Enda Kenny and Michael Noonan, who were a Taoiseach and a Minister for Finance for old people. Kenny and Noonan’s whole existence at the top of Government was about protecting the pensions, wealth and job security of those who were already very secure in Ireland. To this end, Kenny and Noonan maintained high taxes on the young and enterprising, did nothing about the homelessness situation, never addressed the housing crisis with passion and had no interest in investing in proper transport infrastructure such as roads and an underground railway in our capital city. Noonan and Kenny were leading the Irish Nation into the arms of Sinn Fein and the extreme Left who, like Corbyn, would hoover up the votes of disillusioned, angry young people with superficial and un-costed policies that will promise the earth, moon and the stars.Leo Varadkar has a chance to solve the issues facing our young country, and save the centre ground of Irish politics which (under the visionless leadership of Enda Kenny and Michael Martin) is slowly being captured by the Far-Left. The Taoiseach-elect must seize this chance before it is too late and the next general election ushers Sinn Fein and People Before Profit/AAA into Government Buildings. To this end, Dr Varadkar’s cabinet (and particularly his finance minister) must reflect and share his vision.
I couldn’t even get through 3 lines of this without wanting to vomit.Varadkar’s own spin doctors would spit on this as the drivel it is.Either that, or they’re all in the Horseshoe Bar, laughing their asses off over another bottle of Bolly, at the kinda guff the Journal just regurgitates automatically.
Why did Enda need last week off?
 Is the 800 character limit only for app users? That was 3190 characters..
 you should get a hobby, too much time on your hands. Thank you Enda for your historical contributions to this country.
 Thought that was long too. Didn’t it used to be 1500 characters till a few weeks ago even with the newest app update? Please respond if you know or did I imagine this.
Absolute muck!!!
 I look forward to your return to Earth John & the look of disappointment on your face when Leo lets you down with his ‘vision’!
 how did you get around the 800 Journal barrier?
 Nobody cares about varadkar only the parasites like him. Did you honestly think people are going to read that waffle.
He’ll be haunting the place for years to come,The Dail ,RTE and then his reward in Europe.For God’s sake Begone
Good statesman. Haters here forget the scandals and incompetence that were a feature of previous regiemes. Under Ahern and Cowen, the talk was all about brown envelopes, the Galway Tent and untraced lumps of cash. Under Kenny, we saw recovery of both our economy and international profile. Think back to what life was like in 2011 versus today. History will be kind to him and, though he didn’t get everything right, let’s have more like Kenny and less like Bertie & Biffo!
 well said!!.
 Good auld 2011 when we could actually afford rent and a mortgage before we entered the era of 10% increases a year.
 I think you’ll find that two / three into a deep recession, we generally didn’t have money for rent plus mortgage back then. Also we had huge uncertainty around the housing market because prices fell so sharply from this highs of 2005 / 2006 / 2007…maybe you had loads of cash but I think it’s fair to say most people weren’t hopping up the property ladder two steps at a time.
 He is worse than any Fianna Fail. Kenny showed the EU the Irish would bend over even easier.
 This country is a hundred times worse now than then thanks to Kenny.
Let’s pray Merkel will do the same in September?
‘Opportunity’ he mentioned.What utter crap!!!He elbowed his way to the top, skullduggared his way to staying there, and having suckled at the breast of the tax payer, he had the brass balls to sit there today applauding the people who were teabagging him!!!Neck.Jockey’s.
 What pornographic outrage!
  Well said
I really don’t understand the negative comments. Like it or not Enda inherited a country in an absolute mess in €130 billion of debt, he left a country booming. Jobs up, national debt down etc.
 National debt is over 200 billion,thousands of ‘jobs’ are zero hour ,CE and jobridge which the people in them still have to apply for family income supplement. Yes he found the country in a mess and has made it worse except for the few of course.
 Ye keep saying the same old crap he inherited this that and the other. Stop. Once he got it he continued the very same thing he inherited so he was worse than them.
Good bl€€ding riddance…you utter gobsh!te!!
The lot of them are a shower of hypocrits.
Of with you, incompetent can kicking nice guy Enda
Thank F * C K for that! Useless tool!!!!!
36 years sitting on a back bench doing nothing but getting perks then a massive near 400 thousand golden handshake and 140 thousand pension. No wonder he’s always laughing with  mock smile. Paid for NOTHING< Hate this country. Rewards and values useless people.
Did jerry adams just say he’ll miss enda kennys JIZZ …..what is goin on in leinster house
Best of luck to him,he done a great job
 Job? Sitting with a mock smile for 40 years. Is that a job.
Kenny has a nice EU commissioner role awaiting him in Brussels, which is his 30 pieces of silver for not burning the bondholders but burdened the Irish taxpayers with debt.
 that wasn’t him. Blame that lying bast@rd Brian Cowan for that
 Actually jason it was Enda “its not our debt” that put us on the rack,
Please. The people who burdened the Irish taxpayers with debt were the public sector unions, who’s refusal to give an inch on their bloated pay and pensions during the recession led to a €20 billion annual deficit, every year. The bank bailout was small change compared to that.
 €20 > €64?? oh ya I forgot you’re probably using leprechaun economics.
 You are some moron aren’t you if you believe that. Aside from the incontrovertible fact that every public sector employee took a fairly hefty pay cut, one which is only now beginning to be only slightly undone, and had a public sector only pension levy applied, how could anyone forget that it was the failure of private sector organisations – banks and property developers among others – that caused the recession and economic collapse. Don’t be so daft
 Fred would you ever cop on to yourself.
Why wasn’t tosser listed.
Well this gombeen ever exit the stage.he sold out his own people in favour of the EU,has to be the most embarrassing leader ever
The sheer arrogance of the man, did the same when it came to announcing the date of the last General Election, flip-flopping around for months, unwilling to inform the Irish people when they would be allowed to cast their vote, forgetting that he is nothing more than a PUBLIC SERVANT. Should be in jail for treason.
Surely Seannachi-in-chief. I know a homeless fella on a bench in merrion square with a pint in each hand who will second him for the role, as soon as he’s finished phoning everyone to tell them how much extra water is in his taps thanks to fine gael.
He wasn’t good enough to be taoiseach never mind any of the other jobs. The fact that the EU people see him as a soft touch to advance their own objectives (hence all the EU praise) will rule him out for all of those jobs. I can’t remember one important decision he’s made in the 6 years he’s been taoiseach, except that  announcement for the immigrant vote referendum a few months back which will mean nothing to most of us.
 The Aqueduct?
“Recently, there has been speculation that Kenny should be kept on as Brexit minister.”Why would we want “its not our debt” any were near important discussions…..
40 years as a TD, stayed under the radar for 30 odd years collecting his wages and then spent the past few years keeping his masters in Brussels happy to make sure he gets a plum job in Europe. He’s done very well for “himself” and will be looked after while phase two austerity continues to be implemented under stealth taxes and lack of investment in public services. That’s his legacy and as long as the Irish people continue to FF/FG, many more entitled TD’s will enrich themselves on the back of the gullible Irish voter.
While he collects his Taoiseach’s massive pension pot and then the 100k lump sum and the 30k a year teachers pension, he can think about it.
Prison cell
 so it’s a crime to save a country from economic ruins?
 lol
 what planet are you on, I’d like to visit for a few hours.
What about absolute waster?
Quentin Tarantino is looking for a new gimp for Pulp Fiction 2
Would his incompetence be put up with anywhere else.
 Only in the EU…..
He could get a job working for Dinny?Like Cowan did.
Who would have him the circus wouldn’t take him!!
@vinnie Monaghan. Cos he already holds that job title.
He should be booted out of politics.
Why doesn’t he volunteer and dosomething worthwhile ? Why a job with a big salary and yet another pension?
A bog in his beloved mayo,,bury him in it
 Shane with a name like O Malley at u sure u wouldn’t like to be buried with him.
 Yes he should go back to mayo & cut turf, at least he would be doing something constructive & not costing the taxpayer more money
Backbencher?
 backstabber you mean surely
Go back teaching-ar u. Joking-he couldn’t teach a donkey.He will b over in the canaries rubbing the sun cream onto Finnullas back.
Enda wants the private lick arse job to Merkel.
The Daily Edge is policing stupid words now! Really?? Hold on while I “drop” another word. Hopefully it will “slay” #boss
I’m just surprised they didn’t find a way to cram a reference to the abortion debate into this article. First time for everything.
Remember in the good old days when a word could have more than one meaning and context counted for something.
I’ve never actually heard “jizz” used in this context.
 I’ve actually never heard “jizz” at all before. Sounds like a shite word anyway.
Maybe Enda will “come” to Gerrys house and give him some jizz if he’s going to miss it that much. I
He’d a fair bit of spunk in him, that enda fella
Unbelievable that is has taken so long for these brave men to be recognized
 It really is. Congratulations to them all.
 About time.
 Its about time that this country recognize these men for their bravery with the UN in the Congo.
I’d urge anyone who hasn’t seen the brilliant Siege of Jadotville movie to do so. Was left feeling both immense pride and anger, especially after doing a bit of reading on the subject…..en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Jadotville
Great film. Wonderfully understated direction.
The book brought their story to public attention. Declan Power the author has written articles on the Journal if I’m not mistaken.
 if I failingly support them how come I don’t support them on so many issues?
 stick to the story you mupp@t….
 a brilliant movie
 you can watch on Netflix available
This has been too long in coming. These men fought bravely, competently & acquitted themselves in the face of overwhelming odds in the face of a battle tested foe without loosing a single soldier in this engagement. Then they were treated as pariahs when they returned home which must have been the ultimate betrayal. They were probably treated better in captivity than they were when they came home.
 Are the actors getting an award too I wonder?
 ?
 actually, they were treated appallingly while captured which makes the recognition doubly deserved.
I think you should get a medal for outstanding ignorance
Should of been awarded years ago! These men really proved the Irish army are one of the best trained army’s in the world
True Irish men. Brave and moral boys of oglaigh na hEireann. Glad they’ve been recognised at last.
I have known Michael Tighe for forty years and never knew he had fought at Jadotsville. What a very brave man. The medels are long overdue and well deserved. 180 of our soldiers held off a force of hundreds inc. mercenaries. Between 300 and 350 of the enemy killed and only 4 of our soldiers wounded. Amazing. You’ll never beat the Irish!!.
Very sad that so many have passed away before they finally got the recognition they deserve from the state, ln the 60s the children of our country were crying out for hero’s these men were denied the chance to be those heros for a younger generation
And too right  …what a cover-up
And they are handing out medals to our sailors for picking up refugees in boats. As difficult as the sailors task is it’s nothing compared to what these very brave lads did. Then again didnt Conor Cruise O Brien play a part in this this disgraceful period of our history.
A remarkable story of bravery and courage and a story thst was left to long to be told.People like to look down their noses at the Irish army and make snide remarks about them but they are very well trained and very capable too.
Capable of fightin their granny’s.
You are a cynical disgust
 you should be ashamed of yourself. You’re not fit to polish my boots.
Should have kept the Cruiser alive to see this day
Well done to all the men of the 35th battalion who’s lives changed after the Congo. Medals well deserved.
About bloody time.. !!! Well done A company… men like you guys make me proud as a father that my son served with the UN..
Well done to all the men of the 35th Battalion who’s lives changed after the Congo. Medals so well deserved.
Good ol’ Conor Cruise O’Brien !
About time too. Company A fought like tigers, Out gunned & numbered and with remarkably few casualties for such a ferocious battle.  These men were dishonored by successive Irish governments for so long by the refusal to acknowledge their bravery and sacrifice…for shame.

Oh joy, that story just made my day, heroes all, long long overdue.
That was the Irish army of times past, now they sit around smoking pot and complaining about the wages.
 ya think?
 idiot
 gobs@##e
 Men and Woman working in the defense forces deserve more wages. We  could see them on the streets or on our shores before long the way this crazy world is right now. Don’t forget all they do: Protection, humanitarian missions, helicopter and fixed wing Air Ambulance, peacekeeping, and standby for essential services to name a few. Congratulations to these soldiers receiving their medals. Long overdue
 Dave, I’ll come over to you and get you out of your bed at 4.30 hrs and bring you up to the Wicklow mountains and spend the day searching the body parts and see how you feel, especially if we find some or perhaps when the counrt people are under 4 feet of water, you might spend a day and night trying to save they’re homes and livestock. If that doesn’t show you that the military do not sit around smoking pot and complaining about the wages, maybe a stint on an overseas mission away from your family & friends might change your mind…..unless you have walked in our footsteps,….
 muppet.
 how about i bring you out at 5am for a loaded route march for 10k. See how funny you are then.
 you won’t get me, I start work at 3.30.
An absolutely disgraceful act of circling the wagons to save that egotist Connor  Cruise O Briens catastrophic misjudgements….About bloody time…fair play to those brave  men
Delighted  for one and all, heroes everyone of them
To little to late for some while I send congratulation to the men and there families on the news ,this shouldn’t have happen in first place these were true fighting Irishmen that should have made the Irish defence force proud ,they stood there ground against the odds yet government of the time and others treated them like cowards when the real cowards were those that sent them into that conflict in first place.To all the men that fought in that siege those alive and those that passed on history should be rewritten to say you were hero’s not cowards .And if no one has seen the movie on Netflix I recommend it as gives you rough idea what this was all about and the hardship our brave men had to deal with and the stupidity of there superiors.
Well over due and an amazing piece of history. Well done.
What a load of nonsense.
Test
He was visionless and passionless, except in the pursuit and retention of political power.
If Enda is your political hero, you obviously need a day out from your secure ward.
all enda did was heap a debt on to the children of this state enda and noonan will not be missed
 he was desperately trying to make a quote that would stick, make himself memorable in some way. But he tried so many times, he failed miserably!
 Noonan Looked after Limerick/Shannon Airport, and nobody else.
 And fair play to him-the country needs Shannon Airport-there’s more to this country than the Red Cow to Dublin.
 parish pomp politics thats exactly whats wrong with this state Tony.Noonan is a snake nothing more.
Good riddance, can’t stand the sight of him.
 The grin of an extreme gombeen is Enda in that pic. He is the Father Dougal in the Dail along with Tory boy Leo (remember him in Harry Enfield-”Increase mother? I seen no improvement in your productivity and your cooking and cleaning is below par”. Watch Leo in Harry Enfield 31 sec clip outside a dole office. That is so Leo as a young political 13 year old right winger in the making.
 what are you talking about ‘Tory’ boy?
Like Charlie he can claim to have done the state some service,  dishing out the pain ,  while enjoying the Rolls Royce salary and pension.  The banks , the EU, and the Commissioner will miss him.
Ask not what you can do for your country but what your country can do for you. Sums Enda up.
 Well, would do the Job?
 Rolls Royce salary ?  Not a hope daithi on his salary
42 years in the Dail, 6 years as ‘leader’ thanks to a pack of false promises, and whats his legacy?Child poverty doubled, homelessness national emergency, trolley crisis, 40 years of banker debt handed to our kids and grandkids, the gap between rich and poor continuing to widen. And all this while the number of millionaires more than doubles and the haves and have mores laugh all the way to the bank.
 that goes with also the fact he created this ” oh the value of houses went up! And rent rising at same time he gave full power to bankers to go ahead and throw people out of their homes and also sell out to vulture funds .This is the same man who said tax someone’s home was immoral and that’s the first thing he did .He also ignored long enough the economical related suicides whilst taxing and levying the poor penalising the working poor and his ministers for economy and social protection cut people off their benefits with no explanation to reduce numbers to show Angela  Merkel . He invented a so called recovery that does not exist . And perpetuated this lie funded by all this money he took off the people .While the rich bought new cars went on holiday and have a life
 Nicely summed up The Risen. Between your post and Wilhelmina’s post just about wraps this brave “leader” up.Its just a pity nobody has the balls to tell him like it is on his last day.As incompetent as he was, where would he be if it wasn’t for his earpiece?
 At last we agree on something.
 He resigns and the Virgin Mary appears at Knock??? Strange lol.
“Expect plenty of tributes and kind words”. Of course because there are very few in this country who have the courage in this to call a spade a spade.Enda Kenny brought Fianna Fail back into the fold. Enda Kenny put Enda Kenny before the country and not for the first time.
 did they not already have that fawning when he did leaders questions. How many times so they need to do it? He was not worse that the previous FF taoiseach, but it would be hard to be that corrupt or selfish. Nothing achieved on his watch that could not have been delivered by a headless chicken. Noonan, on the other hand, can rot in whatever hole or board he ends up in.
Should be in jail for suppressing instead of implementing findings of #MoriartyTribunal and rewarding corrupt crony with billions of state assets inc #SiteServ #Topaz #IrishWater -water meter contracts (still ongoing) contracts worth one billion alone -plus ordering all state agencies inc garda, armed forces, judiciary etc to buy their fuel from…Topaz. Corruption of the highest order.Meanwhile corruption eats at the soul of our society as the rich and the well-connected walk free from our politicised, biased courts.NO ONE A SHOULD BE ABOVE THE LAW.
Soon to be rewarded with an EU role for his service.
Endas face in the pic just shows the contempt he holds us in with the banking debt he let EU foist on us with no process on the gamechanger himself and champagne socialist Eamon Gilmore announced nearly 5 years ago to the day now.Also that smug smile is the contemptuous face of smug Enda’s massive lump sum & massive pension after himself & Labour liers especially Joan,Rabbitte & Gilmore shamelessly only went after the poorest & most ill citizens during their 5 regressive budgets from 2011-16. FF had two thirds of the cuts done before FG&Labour & FF atleast where alot fairer in their austerity but still awful.Listen to security analysis Tom Clunen on last Tuesdays RTE Late Debate giving a really dignified account of his disabled son & the cuts that Enda and Leo foisted on them 2011-16.
Good crop of whingers on here today.
 Good crop of realists on here today
 we can see the truth we feel it in our pockets struggling away to keep going on the richy rich the plastic Torys the FG supporters their “reality” is way diverse from the real deal here
 you are a loyal whinger.
Worst of luck to him in the future
Thank the God’s, now lets call for a GE  before the sky is painted.
Good riddance to enda Kenny,he was a terrible taoiseach,and brought shame on the office.
Dear Enda,Thanks very much for all you’ve done for me and my friends.I will be eternally grateful to you.Good luck in your retirement.Your buddySeanie FitzP.S. See you in Marbs soon.
Never a fan. Didn’t envy what he faced. His best moment was schooling Trump in front of the world.
 LOL! What, the same trump he pilloried when it looked like hilary was going to win?
 Did you miss the speech? I recommend you watch it:https://youtu.be/Aja2QnROOhs
  Of course I watched it. American sitcoms are some of my very favourite things….
 Where was the humour? I must have missed that bit?
  Yep.
 You’ve lost your edge jammin’.  Enjoy retirement :)
 the hippocritical speech given by a man whose government oversee’s direct provision? Yeah, vest moment. Cynical move by a cynical man who should be pilloried not plauded.
Nauseating listening to the likes of Martin and Adams talking about him like he is the saviour of Ireland. They should take a look at the mess he is leaving behind him.
 just goes to show that despite all the posturing, Adams/sf  are the same as the rest of them. Fg/fg/lab/sf – party and self interest/gain before people.Will no one stand up and call him and that leech noonan for what they are? Is there no one?
 they are all alike . Like divorce lawyers they say one thing this week another next and then go out to lunch together on your dough .
Enda will be missed by all. He led the cleaned up and the mess left behind by FF. A true Irishman who will be up there with Dev & Michael Collins in our history books
 “He will be missed by all “-Are u for real-He will be missed all right-like a pain in the head.
 yes by all. He was a powerful Commander in Chief. Sad day
 He couldn’t command a piss up at a brewery.
 FF destroyed the economy of the country, of that there is no doubt. Enda Kenny destroyed society.The biggest liar, fantasist, friend of banks, vulture funds and corporations the country has ever seen. A sell out to Europe, a big friend of Dobby, keep him from facing the  consequences of the Moriarity Tribunal.We can add a friend of the corrupt.Contemptuous of the ordinary citizens.
 Deluded moron.
a coward and an a**lick.He’ll miss himself.
Thats nice of himmaybe after he can meet the The man with two pints and have a chat, you know about the Army and the banks and those sort of stories!
Watching the footage of Frances “Satan” Fitzgerald sitting beside Kenny makes me feel profoundly nauseous
His own ministers stabbed him in the back, ousted him and are now lining up to heap praise on him. Varadkar was the worst of them. Tried to wriggle out of the Dept of Health because it was too tough and was putting him in the limelight in a negative way.  Affecting his chances of taking out the boss.  Now listen to him. Enda’s practically the best thing that happened the country since the electric grid.   What a sneaky, conniving little man. Thankfully he’s only going to be in the job until FF pull the plug in November.
 If only we could depend on FF but Mehole Martin hasn’t the guts to call an election. He’s now into bullying the smaller parties for having too much speaking time. But they are elected by the people so have a right to speak. Even if it Shite talk
Sickening stuff from a man who promised so much and delivered so little. The mans legacy will be paid for by our great grandchildren…
Thank goodness for the Tusla/Maurice McCabe scandal for forcing IndaKinny out of the FG leadership & his job. If he hadn’t been caught out for telling one lie too many, he would have still been Taoiseach tomorrow, that’s for sure!
Enda’s idea of Ireland has only 26 counties. He’s no patriot.
 What’s your solution so, take them back against the wishes of the people living in them? That’ll go down well.
 As opposed to your solution of keeping the country divided against the wishes of the people? Cos that went well too didn’t it?
 wishes of the people???
Sold out to euro banks no balls
A career politician who could hardly string 6 words together ,gone to enjoy his pensions or get onto a board of  a large company that pays very little tax in Ireland , Good riddance to him
His egoistical speech akin to Haugheys“I’ve done the country a service and they know it ”Utter poppycock
For the amount of people that whinge about him, some of you must have voted him in. So deal with the consequences.
Utterly repulsive man, those who followed the gravy train and had they’re snouts in the trough were looked after, everyone else was shafted, water charges, austerity, garda scandal etc, etc, etc could be here all evening one of the worst of all time
All European countries even Britian would be glad to have such a prime minister…Much better than Cameron and with help of Trioca got economy out of recession…Biggest mistake was not having Senate vote again when people made such a stupid decision…
 He followed the troika plan agreed with FF, and it was the hard work and suffering of the masses which turned things around while enda was having his head rubbed.Yeah, some achievement all right…..
 Yes we know SF would have done so much better……Masses should try Northern Ireland where SF used to be in power  dole is half what it is here
 don’t worry wait and see “the Europe “will have him he will get himself a nice cushy €€€€ Jobie in Brussels just like them others do
All the tributes he go today from TDs from all sides is not reflected in the comments from the common men and woman of this battered country.
 that’s because they all have big fat pensions to look forward to and sure they’re all going on their jolly days soon ….sure why would you be in a bad mood sure school’s almost out for all the ex teachers…..
Good riddance glad to see the back of him
Hopefully its quickest good bye and hopefully wont have to listen to his bullshit lies anymore
 nah we be listening to that other evil despicable tw*t another Margareth Tatcher wanna be Varadkar. While we listening his ministers will empty our already empty pockets and instead of “tightening your belt ”  this time he will say – eat your belt . Cause there be no chance of you being allowed pay bills and stupid invented double taxes and levies that he will come up with . While his mates the rich are having fun with your money
His favourite dinner was a dry roast… that is not acceptable best he’s gone.
Well this is something, the last time I saw something as rabid as  this was the Brexit crowd who complained about everything but stood for nothing and their politicians have been trying to deal with it ever since.  It is a strange combination of being conformists and contrarians at the same time but such a stance come from those who have convictions about everything  as long as it creates chaos – sort of parish politics on steroids.
I’d like to strike a balance here. Clearly he’s not everyone’s friend but he did do some good in my opinion.The country was a shit show when he took over. Steadied the ship and left us all better off whether you like it or not. It’s a fact.
A disgrace to the Country
 Some whingers must have voted him in though
A true f**kin eejit
A village idiot
 Now IndaKinny’s free to take up the job as some village in his homeland of Mayo is crying out for someone like him!
What exactly is he doing in that picture? Suggestions anyone?
A coward a criminal and an idiot.Inflicted austerity on the weakest, caused suicide,evictions, emigrated thousands. Enjoy your 20 pensions gangster!
Ridiculous picture shows a bias in this supposed unbiased piece. Cheap.
The man with 2 pints in one hand????????????????????????????????????
He was a reluctant TD and an accidental Taoiseach, that is about the kindest thing I can say about him..
Narcissistic fool. Was in attendance at one of his talks and as soon as he was finished he was away with the fairies for the rest of the function paying no attention whatsoever to the other speakers who included the tainaiste. In a complete world of his own. Spineless and weak. If he truly was a leader we’d be paying for and conserving water by now. Instead he leaves behind as big a mess and he found.
Cue abuse
42 years, Jesus wept. It’s high time term limits were put on TD’s, you accumulate a lot of people you owe ‘favours’ in that time.
 And the ability to fire them when they blatantly lie. How we allow corrupt liars to stay in place is beyond me? Promised political reform but not a peep since. Democracy is dead and we just watch on as the elite  consolidate their wealth and power. They laugh at us as they stroke their clueless sheep’s little egos and send them off to do their bidding.
 We have the ability to fire them…just don’t vote for them.
 Are you that deluded?! We don’t have the ability to fire them. They have their couple of thousand troglodytes that vote for them no matter what they do and they will always get past the post. If people are naive enough to think we control them then we truly are helpless.
 couldn’t agree more. Term limits on all elected representatives.
 If we got off our backsides, used our vote and voted them out. Then you’d see them dance, but we sit at home and moan about the results afterwards.
 We can fire them every time there’s an election.
 there should be a mechanism in place to recall a TD when the electorate is not satisfied with the performance. Then the Party seat can be replaced by another Member of the same Party by constituency election.
 Do you have to invoke the name of Jesus in this way to make your comment.
Jesus christ, “we should use our vote”?  If we could use our votes to fire them how come it’s hasn’t happened yet? Irish people suffer from a form of stockholm syndrome. Look at this article for example, arse kissing at it’s best.
 Not defending Kenny personally I think he is absolutely no loss & he is equally as bad as FF for his cronies but we the people of Ireland have to look at ourselves when we elect people who have committed a crime (Tax fraud) as is the case with Mick Wallace. He got elected twice & has absolutely no respect for the office he was elected to. He is only concerned with himself & couldn’t care less about those who elected him. If you committed a crime like this revenue would have you in prison
Thank God and good riddance
 this article ignores the fact Labour where neck and neck with Fine Gael From  08 to 11. I will never know how naive the Labour leadership was to go into coalition with a conservative party like Fine Gael. Self interest tops political principle I suppose. But to me that is his greatest achievement.  He must be laughing at those suckers everyday.
They’re all talking about how “great” kenny was on the TV now, but they don’t think he’s fit for the job! The credibility of the whole lot of them right now is being spectacularly shattered!
That’s a hard one. What did he do?????????
 quite a lot but you begrudges just won’t acknowledge any of it.
 quite a lot of damage, I’ll acknowledge that! And surely if he was doing an adequate job, he wouldn’t be forced to resign.
 His Dail speech on the Cloyne report, ”  where the swish of a soutane smothered conscience and  humanity ”And his Patrick ‘s day speech in front of Donald Trump which went viral, viewed more than 30 million times .Can’t deny him that ………….
 Talk is cheap. It’s even cheaper when it’s coming out of a politician’s mouth.
@judy Burke… you hardly believe he wrote that stuff himself do you? Such serious delusion is surely not possible.
 Well I guess if you’re wealthy then yes he did a lot for you. I’m sure it was worth his while one way or another.
Do you really believe they were his words? A good speech writer and delivered by an average public speaker.
 In 1975 he came across as a bit of a dope. Then he got slowly worse.
His legacy will include his cold blooded refusals to meet survivors of Ireland’s Mother and Baby homes and defending the nuns and Catholic church who neglected over 6,000 babies to death.
 vile crook of a man
 don’t forget about the bank’s
 man with 2 pints tanks at ATM imaginary conversation with other TDs ect ect
Lies, cover ups, frauds. Mass emigration, record levels of patients on trollies and homelessness. The targeting of the sick and poor in cuts, removal of medical cards from sick children and the elderly, USC, Irish water, eircode. All this achieved when he led the country all be it like Pinocchio on string, what he achieved in the 42 years, a big pension. So long Enda, the clown prince of mayo.
 inept, uncaring piece of **it  so glad the bugger is going
Enda Kenny looked after the powerful, wealthy and the privileged at the expense of the weak, poor, sick and disadvantaged. In his own terms, that was a great success.He was a Taoiseach for some of the people but not for those who needed a visionary and egalitarian minded politician.
He and Fine Gael will be remembered as the party that consolidated FFs sellout of the country when even the Troika felt the deal was too harsh.You are as bad as Aherne and Cowan
But the deal was done before his time? How was it his fault he had to follow through with it?
now a choice between coveney, the connected bilderburger, or vararakar, the socially liberal, pro wealthy elite conservative. God help us.
Kenny will be known as the man who sold his soul and the rest of Ireland Inc to stay in power!
Great news Kenny is gone. Now  take that yoke Noonan with you.
Endas personal TV channel on RTE is talking about him as if he was christ almighty. Sharon neeee vo lawn is a right tool bag. She is full of Sh*t like the rest of RTE Fianna Gael. Its stomach churning looking at the mentally challenged Fianna Gael supporters. A grenade in the middle of them.
I’ll only ever remember him as Europes yes boy. An institutionalised fumbling liar who only ever put himself and the welfare of his beloved party first. He never had the character or the qualities to be a leader and neither has either of the two default stooges in waiting.
 Exactly
 Ha. “He worked very hard”. A lot of us work an awful lot harder only to see our hard earned cash vanishing on taxes and poor gov policy of inflating house prices.
 you are very deluded
 RTE is the government mouthpiece.
All this hate he is receiving here is unfair. He took over from an absolute mess and got rid of the troika but of course the looney lefties will continue to slate him. Hope he will enjoy his retirement.
 And the deluded will keep praising him!
 he got rid of the troika?? really? by forcing gamblers private debt onto the working irish people for generations to come while forcing austerity onto his own people at the same time, he’s Europe’s little sock puppet and a disgrace to Ireland
 We’re not looney lefties you Pri*k. We are not blindfolded like you. He was a parasite.
 he is a traitor
 typ
 typical response from the usual idiots. Look at the country now compared to when he took over. Although not without his faults his legacy will be that he left the country a hell of a lot better than when he started
 He’ll enjoy his retirement alright since he feathered his nest very well. Others won’t have such a nice retirement and don’t tell me that he worked hard for it unless you mean worked a room full of wealthy FG donors.
 “Hope he enjoys his retirement” ?  You are having a laugh. This self-serving gombeen has presided over more homelessness that this country has endured since 1922. Mass emigration by our best young people, most of whom will make a life elsewhere. The destruction of the health service and instead of standing up for  the country sold us out to the banks and bondholders. Has full confidence in a police service where corruption is accepted. Disgusting man.
His legacy will include his cold blooded refusals to meet survivors of Ireland’s Mother and Baby homes and defending the nuns and Catholic church who neglected over 6,000 babies to death.
Are you not over egging the omelette with your reluctant Taoiseach description . It was like all his wet dreams came together when he was appointed. I give you credit for the other half of your headline, he certainly was reluctant to leave.
 Would the leader of any party not want to be taoiseach?
 Use your cop on , that’s if you have any. I was referring to the headline, not his personal choice . In your haste to be clever you forgot to engage your brain.
 You’ve missed my point completely. Have a canberry juice.
He delivered for Fine Gael that’s the problem with the 2 main political parties – they don’t deliver for the country or the people just the party they serve and to line their own pockets. A taoiseach who never led his country only slowly reacted and did what he was told.
 He delivered nothing for Ireland. He turned this country back to the 50′s. Backwards its gone under his watch.
 how so? I’m genuinely looking forward to your answer to this. How is Ireland today even remotely comparable to Ireland of the 50s?
  It’s a broken country with no money or morals
what legacy -one of the biggest con artists in the history of the state.
He crippled us with depth that was not ours.He STOLE 4.2 Billion from private pensions.He took medical cards from those in need.He took the Home package from the OAPS.He  abolished the death grant.He destroyed our health service.He caused the greatest homelessness in history.He led the Irish Tory Party.
 And he handed over vast tracts of land and property to the culture funds – and for low or no tax.
Enda becoming Taoiseach was a case of right place, right time. It didn’t matter who was leading the party. It wasn’t a pro Fine Gael vote as they try to claim but an anti Fianna Fail vote. Enda won the death election after his father died and parish pump kept him there. What are his achievements in those 42 in politics?As for the recovery, he was implementing Fianna Fail policies put into by Brian Lenihan.Is it any wonder how easily Fianna Fail are forgiven when people can easily wrap the actualities of the situation to gladly accept the lie and continue to live in ignorance.
Good riddance
Marriage equality. Respect to him for that
 Don’t even think of giving him credit for that. The likes of David Norris was working for decades to achieve that not the vegetable enda.
  I recall him reluctantly coming out in support of the issue…didn’t he fall over a plant pot once when trying to avoid the issue?.  As much as labour disappointed me, credit where credit is due, Labour and in particular Eamon Gilmore really fought for that to be brought through.  That should be very much part if their legacy, not so much Fine Gael.
 Marriage equality. Respect to the people who voted in favour of it.
Headline is a blatant lie. What reluctance. He lied through his teeth to get into power and said he’d leave months ago. He had to be dragged out of power.
Worst taoiseach in the history of the state never engaged with us the common folk
 I really think that is unfair tbh. He wasn’t the greatest by any measure, but he was dealt a shit hand and country has really turned around on his watch. Whether that was almost his doing or not is debatable but it’s wrong to say he was the worst ever
The Accidental Taoiseach, blundered into the post due to the congruence of Fine Gael meltdown which gifted him the leadership, just as Fianna Fail crashed the good ship Ireland into the rocks! He has been blundering about the deck ever since, having his belly rubbed by Merkel and his hair tousled by Sarkozy while yelping at the deck hands to work harder and longer for less! His legacy? Well history will judge him!
A 60 year dept plan is he legecy.
 I bet only the interest will be paid off and not the debt???
Do people forget the state of the country and where it was heading when he took over?
 Yes but you obviously don’t remember they were Fianna Fail policies he was implementing. You remember, those guys that Enda spent his whole first term blaming on everything rather than actually answering any questions. Those same guys in Fianna Fail that are now in coalition in everything but name with Fine Gael.
 Fair enough and I won’t claim to know a whole lot about the ins and outs of politics but I just think the damage Fianna Fail had done meant no matter who took over it was never going to be an easy to repair the damage.  I just fear the same thing will happen again, people seem to have short memories and don’t tend to learn from past mistakes
 It’s also worth remembering that both Fine Gael and Labour were calling for even more reckless spending while in opposition to Fianna Fail. People do seem to have very short memories but that goes mostly for Enda and Fine Gael who brought Fianna Fail back into the fold so Enda could achieve his personal ambition of becoming the first Fine Gael Taoiseach to serve consecutive terms.There are no past mistakes, this is blatant corruption and Enda presided over a lot of it.
 you praise enda Kenny while claiming not to know the ins and outs of politics and that people have short memories. People like you are the reason the likes of enda stay in power.
Surviving the heaves against him has a strong Charlie Haughey touch – Fionnuala learned a few things from her time close to The Boss!
Thanks be to God.
Legacy!!!! lol, just get out Enda you prize clown
At last the Traitor is going, probably to a nice little earner in the EU after selling the Irish people out to his EU buddies.A disgusting man.
He’s taking over as manager of the Mayo team apparently….Mayofor…..
What legacy, glad to see the back of him,
Enda Kenny’s quality of leadership was such, that he would only be followed out of curiosity and even that is doubtful.
Don’t let this distract you from the fact that in 1972, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn’t commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still wanted by the government they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them….maybe you can hire The A-Team.
A living oak
And shove your water meters up your hole as well !
 you dont drink any free water i presume karl???!!! He was right about the whingers.   Plenty of them around. I have not much and im getting old but i have the right attitude. Its a positive one and i earned all i have since i Left home with nothing 34 yrs ago .  just a positive attitude will get you a long way
 No such thing as free water, there never was. Maybe you should use that positive attitude towards informing yourself.
It’s not all bad. The saviour leo the lion, is waiting in the wings to lead us to the promised land. You’ve seen nothing yet, wait till he leaves the whole country in the same state he left his last two portfolios. Currently looking under cardboard boxes on dame Street for welfair fraudsters so I’m told.
A total hypocrisy.fg member’s that wanted him gone,for good reason, praising him today.
 talk about hypocrisy, liberals here commenting on how he done nothing. Where were Gerry Adams or Paul Murphy during the negotiations after the election? Yous don’t want to be in power, you just want to sit on the sidelines complaining about lack of progress.
Property tax, water charges, debt that is kicked down the road like an old can for the next generation to pay, USC and a search engine full of scandals but Merkel probably has a job for him now?
And Sarkozy was a little bo…x, seeing his photo there…
Same old Same old
Have to admit I didn’t bother to read the article. Glad the wa*ker has stepped down but unfortunately there’ll be another wa*ker to take his place because they’re all self serving in FG.
The biggest CLOWN that Ireland ever produced!! An embarrasment to the country!!
Austerity,IW and the best lick arse in the eu
A lot of the people here are the unique form of Irish Socialist. Reduce taxes but increase spending. It doesn’t work. Considering where we were in 2011 with unemployment rocketing, unable to borrow, banks 2 months from complete shutdown, tax take plummeting, what has happened in this country over the last 5 years, the recovery to where we are, has been almost unbelievable.
 what recovery exactly?
Enda was Mr. Shallow. Politically void. A Mayo cute hoor capable of small town ruthlessness when back against the wall.
Sure we didn’t lose a cancer cure,He won’t have to go on FAS or start laying blocksHis cronies in Brussels have a cushy one lined up for him
Good bye!!!! Enda sick and tried of FG
 it will only benefit FG!
Why is it always reluctant taoiseach, surely he wanted the job.
 that’s all he ever wanted. You don’t stay in a job for 40 years, without actually having something to show for it, if you don’t have your eye on the prize.
As Bonaparte might have said he was lucky and that qualified him with a C+ grade as Taoiseach in my estimation when one considers he welded FG together from meltdown and then steered the country through economic disaster while in coalition government. Pity about the photo shoots though!
All I’ve ever known is Enda as leader of FG. In just that young.
Great leader
Reluctant basically…. Good riddance
in fairness he has nice hair
 Because I’m worth it… the pensions lol.
So much blind hate on here tells me more about the poster than endawas enda great, no,was he a reincarnation of hitler, no,if he’s blamed for everything the was wrong in his reign, equally you have to give him credit for what was good, growth, unemployment drops, equality in marriage etc…
He was irelands jfk
 Yes your right, jammy fcuking knob.
His so called sucessfull 5 point plan was lies so how journal can say this is crazy  one water system could be repaired by billions put into irish water which should never happened he promised to burn bond holders more lies he said cut waiting lists in hospitals have increased we have property crisis health care shambles and people living in hotels how could the journal be objective and say sucessful leader considering all this
Well the comments sums him all up! Spot on…. and yet he leaves with a big fat pension and us in a big mess! Families are homeless, people are still struggling everyday.
Just another quintessential stroke politician achieving his lifetime goal of nailing his fat cat ludicrous pension compliments of the decent irish people he failed so miserably.Good riddance indeed
Thirty odd years of doing feck all then carried out the deal FF made with the troika.
Really? Worst leader we have ever had? That is deluded. Of course to mention the names of our past illustrious leaders in any negative manner is blasphemy – DeValera, Haughhey, Ahearne – all salt of the earth, their corruption was know, but sure it was open and blatant so that was ok! Hopefully we can get over our silliness, forgive FF and let them ruin the country again
Enda Kenny’s legacy you say? Yeah he ruined this country and now at the cost the tax payer , like other cronie politicians he gets retirement money. #FuPeopleOfIreland&ThanksForYourDonations
 TAX?
His legacy? He made Fianna Fail look good again!The man is a back-stabbing traitor to the nation.
A failed politician.
Government has always been a criminal enterprise, making tax slaves out of the electorate. The less we participate in this charade the better for all of us. Governments, if they were legitimate would be tiny well-run local organisations creating no interference in our lives.
A remarkable liar!
Fine Gael only party who represent working families. Labour mouthpiece for Public Sector asking to pay them even more. Sinn Fein and their Marxist agenda – living in the 50′s. Fianna Fail – the Brown Bag party with no moral compass. I will stick with FG thank you.
 I am a ‘working family’ and they don’t represent me.However they do represent those who can afford Mobile Phone Licences, Farm Extensions, Extra Landlorded houses, etc.FG the ‘party’ of the corrupt elite, they bring the brown envelope to a whole new level.
Enough said:http://www.unitedpeople.ie/enda-kenny-prime-example-of-why-system-change-is-needed/
Irelands jfk
The best good day for Enda kenny + Co is whatever day (some say it will  be definitely on a crunchie Friday) is when the he gets his big fat massive  retirement lump sum in addition to his obscene pension pot of gold!  Then he will ride into the sunset to commence 3 (more) months (additional) holidays!  No doubt about it this is a Great little Country to do Business in (indeed)!Possibly a vanity project library to him in Castlebar costing millions. And a poster over his bed of his date with Fraulein Merkel with a water meter in the background.He is going to join those failures Gilmore, Rabbit, and Hogan in the EEC retirment home for failures and licks to Merkel. I must read the Irish fawning press articles today.Take me home to Mayo with my big pot of gold Suckers!!
Christ!! The first photo at the top of the page looks likes me when i made my first communion. Uncanny!
 A Politician calls… lol.
He should be seen as the leader that provided leadership and lead the country through its worst crisis… but I am sure those that think that Ireland should have done what Greece did, but before they did it, won’t see it that way.. He was a remarkable leader..
Yawn
He made oak trees proud
The best hair in politics
 Heir Merkel?
Nicolas Sarkozy a snearing git…
th
 the q
 at the third attempt or maybe third time lucky-the question was what was his legacy and the answer is Three pensions and a plum job in Europe.
“Most likely, normal business of the day will be suspended and adjourned until the next day.”Sound lads, half day. And with summer holidays just around the corner…
 Dont forget you & me the tax payer is paying for the party & hand shake
 And if they didn’t get paid then no one would do the job. There’d be no government just lawlessness. Would you like that. Everybody pays and funds everyone else’s salaries. The thousands of people hired by American companies get paid because other people use their services. Plumbers, builders, accountants, dentists etc etc get paid because “we the tax payer” use their services. It’s not difficult.
 Yes, but you can choose who your plumber is and before you say you can choose who the leader is, you cannot.Furthermore your plumber does not come to an agreement with you regarding the supply of water and how it is paid for and then decide to move the goalposts and charge you again because if he did you would fire him and get a new plumber.
 My plumber doesn’t want a golden handshake & be paid.
Thanks Enda. Thanks for nothing.
 what about 60 odd billion in private debt shoved down our throats.. what about the criminal waiting times in hospitals…what about the shambles that is the upper echelons of the Garde.. what about the 1000′s left homeless..what about the gigantic fk up that is Irish Water.. Jenny we are more than an economy.
 Is that what it’s called? Lolz.
In a shock move Enda Kenny takes out a steal chair and clatters Leo, stands over him, turns to the rest of the Dail then Oireachtas TV and shouts “Are you all not entertained?”
Leo the minister for everything but his actual brief now gets to be the actual minister for everything. The mind boggles. It’s become a popularity contest.
Taoiseach by default. Even Verukas own party members don’t want him. Give him time to p*ss enough people off – FF will pull the plug & they can interchange yet again. Whoopee !
Probably not the first to say GOOD RIDDANCE
Same circus, new hoops to jump through…
We will learn a lot about the character of Veradker  when we see who he appoints to Ministerial positions.
 will not be any suprises in cabinet Simon Harris probably left in health as punishment for supporting coveney
 That a what I was alluding to. Is he planted in the old school network or is he not? Capability should take precedence over loyalty but will it ? ..
Ah no thanks. There has to be something better on the telly!
Enda is easily the best Taoiseach of the millennium so far. On that we can all agree.

 How can we agree with your delusions? Biggest sponger in the state.
Leo will make Noonan look like a pussy cat. A committed, far right, neoliberal globalist. The people never voted for this.
 You mean you didn’t vote for it. The people who vote for the loonie left are in a minority, grant it a noisy minority but a minority none the less.
 Over their decades in power the rabid right have managed to destroy both the economy, and society in the country, while protecting their cronies.The left is such a small insignificant minority, you won’t see Leo, Mehole, or Howlin wanting to test that lie at the ballot box anytime soon.The real minority is the government in power thanks to backroom deals.
 And the people that vote for the treasonous right need to be ashamed of themselves.The country is destroyed with corruption and scandal. Was it the “Loony Left” that destroyed this country?Anyone that still votes for FF/FG needs to take a good hard look at themselves.Change is needed in this country and the sooner the better.
 In case it has escaped your mind we had a election at the start of last year. The people spoke, you lot might not have liked the answer they gave but there you go that’s democracy for you. To broaden your support base you might want to start offering something to the near 2 million of us that actually work and create the wealth of the country.
 oh right so the majority of us are fool. So I take it you aspire to the economic policies of Venezuela or even North Korea. Sounds good kid, sounds good.
 Looks like your lot are using the same economic policies as Venezuela and North Korea. Look where that got us.Sorry to have to burst your bubble but in the real world FF/FG between them have made sh*t of the country….
 Well that depends on how you define sh*t. One of the fastest growing economies in Europe, a job for anyone who  WANTS one. I fail to see the comparison you draw with Venezuela or North Korea. Anyway that’s me out I’ve to go into work and actually earn my living.
 The people didn’t speak for FG or Enda Kenny. The only way FG and Enda Kenny got into power was by way of backroom deals.Not by being voted in at the ballot box.
 Yes we did Dave. You didn’t, you loser!
 Please don’t confuse democracy with putting a 1,2,3 on a piece of paper every 5 years or so, it is not.
Incorrect. He has not been acting-Taoiseach. He remains Taoiseach until Dáil Éireann elects a new Taoiseach. The leadership race was internal FG matter.
The worst thing about this that this failure will now move on to create a biggest mess in the EU.
Good luck Enda. You will probably be hated by the begrudgers for a long time, and they will probably start trying to alter history to blame everything on you.You weren’t perfect, but you were a decent Taoiseach.
 The begrudgers like who, people you can’t get home, people who can’t get hospital beds? It’s not the begrudgers you need to watch out for, it’s deluded people like you. Kenny overseen vast amounts of corruption and some of you people are OK with that.
 Can’t decide whether it is delusion or ignorance ?Probably FG induced delusion.
He hasn’t gone away, he will be on the ‘back benches’ for a while to come.Counting his pensions.
Enda a yoke of a joke
A failed school teacher blueshirt replaced with a strangely conservative younger blueshirt.
It is tragic that Irish nationalism has no representation in Westminster for the first time since 1830.The Tory/DUP government is loving it.
 yet SF could change that if they wanted, instead Gerry is to busy mouthing off in the Dail about Brexit….
 Innovative an idea as keeping your election pledge is to a FGer, I’ll try to explain it for you as simply as possible.Nationalists in the north were given a choice. Vote for the SDLP who will pledge an oath to the queen in order to take their seats in westminister, or vote for Sinn Fein who would not.The SDLP lost all of their seats, whereas SF increased their seat compliment by 75%
 Gerry Adams is the obstacle for real advancement – he is stuck in a republicanism time warp that is now outdated – let them take up their seats in Westminster and earn their money !
 well they’ll get their expenses.. oh sorry; they get those anyway…..!!!!
Except Mike, he’s trebled their votes in Ireland since leader, and scares the establishment so much that Ff and Fg have joined to stop him.
If the Brits don’t want to pay the Shinners’ expenses and fund SF and the retired provos, they can leave the North.Simple as.
 Or introduce a ruling for minimum time spent in chambers. Lots of ways to deal with this if somebody wants to. And there is no urgency on any of the big 2.
 What goes on in the house of commons is nothing more than a pantomime.real work gets do elsewhere, certainly not there!
The same as the Dail talking shop
 you are of course aware that you need to take your seats to engage in any vote and that is where the real work is done. It is bloody rich for SF to bemoan the effect of Brexit on NI when they are one of the very few people who could actually do something about it.
 what harm is pledging an aliens to the queen . I taught Ireland moved on.there is a lot of Irish in U.K.soon ireland  will be pledging to Muslim. There is lot in Ireland.
 Jeremy Corbyn is a good supporter of Irish Nationalism. To a lesser degree the Tories have always supported the Unionists in Ulster.
 Jeremy Corbyn will represent Sinn Féin in Westminster. He always has- and the Tories and DUP hated him for it. They called him an “IRA sympathiser”. Also when will FF/FG take their seats in the North? Finally I do think S.F should go back into the Assembly.
Oh look, its that time of the year again when enda remembers Ireland has 32 counties. It almost like Sinn Fein are back in the headl…………..ah.
There is more to Northern Ireland than your Sinn Féin party.Thankfully, some politicians are not running away from the debate in Westminster.
 Would you pledge an oath to the queen in order to sit in westminister? (By the way, loved how that FF TD refused to answer that question on Clare Byrne yesterday after discussing FFs plans to run candidates in the 6.)
 Monkey boy would swear allegiance to the devil himself to keep the bigots in power , he must be creaming himself at this news . But wait till the average Brit gets to see what the DUP are actually about . Or the cash for ash report which is due out soon which will now become a huge story in the UK instead of a provincial one . I have the popcorn ready .
Pledge an oath, cross your fingers behind your back, do something, anything other than the same stale carp that you’ve been doing since I was in nappies.Maybe consider changing your party leader once every fifty years or so, too.
 If people want Sinn Fein to take their seats then they can never complain about politicians breaking election promises again.
 If there were no oath of allegence or affirmation sworn on the Bible would Sinn Fein take their seats at Westminster. Probably not because they still refuse to recognise the British parliaments position over legislating for Northern Ireland.The logic of the Sinn Fein position is self defeating. As without legislation there can be no recognition of a local government administration, exactly the position they find themselves in at the moment with the defunct Stormont Assembly. Sinn Fein are a self confessed dictatorship and rule of law unto themselves.
Diarmuid , What do you think your party the DUP will think of their allies in FG  having a gay man as their new leader.
 Iris will be on the job. Leo will be saved.
 Much as Iris would be up for it, Leo is spoken for.
 So was Iris. Haven’t been keeping up with her recently. Leo might be a little old given her form. Thought she just might take an interest
 The Tories have a gay woman for leader in Scotland, thats life so accept it and move on.
 Does’nt bother me at all .The DUP, now that’s a different matter.
According to the Good Friday agreement the Irish and British governments, as participants in the peace process, are to remain totally neutral, fair and impartial…How is it then possible, or even legal, for them to now hook-up politically with one side in the conflict? How could they oversee or govern with impartiality?Despite what Charlie F and FG/DUP say…this WILL impact on the still very fragile peace process.
 I was wondering that. just say the DUP refuse to establish an executive with SF and it’s goes to direct rule from london. would the DUP then be in breach of the GFA by being in power with the Tories?
 I agree Pádraig. It should not be allowed to happen. This is a middle finger to the Good Friday Agreement if it goes ahead.
 there is no more trouble it just a game shin fane are playing.
It’s amazing how ff and Fg have just allowed the tories to destroy the GFA.
 Have they? How so? Okay take it that they are not honest brokers but destroy it?
 So DUP are not allowed into UK government but SF are allowed eneter government here. Surely both would damage GFA. GFA can only be damaged if people choose to terrorise people. Their choice and no one else fault.
 FF and FG main aim in all of this is to try to damage SF. They don’t give two F’s about NI only when it can be used against SF their political rival.
 Charlie Flanagan was never interested in helping out the Northern Nationalists. He was interested though in digging out the DUP, but that backfired when they supported Brexit. LOL
I’d say May (as are most uk politicians) is cursing our gov at the moment for letting terrorists into their country, that were initially directly refused entry into the UK. Cursing us for being, with Finland, the country in Europe who currently have the most Muslims in our country who have gotten terrorist training in Syria, according to sky news.
Kinda ironic, two irrelevants discussing relevance, good riddance to both
On the positive side it may never happen, DUP won’t change their strongly held beliefs for anyone.
 of course they won’t. They are superior in their minds. Look at Drumcree and the resilience they showed. Out of pure bitterness. That takes generations to remove. And negotiations with a party whose next choice likely leader is that buffoon Boris. Even FG have a better gene pool to them both
As much as I hate having to agree with you, you are more than likely correct, I am certainly no fan of Enda Kenny but I have my doubts on Leo when it comes to dealing with this fiasco. Hopefully I’m  proven wrong.
 There might be a legal challenge taken in the UK against this proposed coalition , using the legal terms of the GFA as it’s reasoning.
I never thought of that, it’s certainly raising more questions than answers.
 As one comedian put it last week – ‘Boris is a twit and a clown who just isn’t funny’. Boris says one thing and then does the complete opposite, a liar at the best of times and totally unreliable.
Has spoken with Thersea May this morning? Before or after Mass?
 Enda Kenny should leave the talking to Leo Varadkar, as it is Theresa May is described by George Osbourne today as ‘a dead woman walking’.Whatever agreement they come to it has its shortcomings.
Hilarious that you were all here last week complaining that the journal was reporting too much on an election that ‘has nothing to do with Ireland’
Stay civil, stay constructive, stay on topic… I’ll get my coat.
The real problem here goes back to the failure of the boundary commission in 1925 to organise the separation of the North of Ireland from the Free State based on the areas with the largest Unionist or Nationalist majorities. The Unionists were not prepared to let go of the Nationalist majority areas in Northern Ireland and the Free State was not prepared to let go of the Unionist majority areas in the Free State. In effect the Boundary Commission never completed its work. We are nearly 100 years now trying to pick up the pieces. A repartition on the basis of the 2017 election clearly illustrates where the border should have been with a Nationalist enclave in West Belfast.
All credit  to  the  DUP…    Must  admit  they do have  a  ‘burning’  ambition! !!!
 Yea, burning crosses in front of catholic churches and homes!
Two lame ducks discussing their pensions
FACT CHECK PLEASE JOURNAL
 Zzzzzzzz
 Couldn’t agree more mate. Total snoozefest of an article.
 The Journal did do a Fact Check on your mate Justin Barrett and his National Party, guess what, the chap was full of porkie pies and got a royal flush of false statements, keep spouting his nonsense though, we can always do with a good laugh!
 I don’t know who that is so he mustn’t be a very good friend. Something tells me that young halawa isn’t full of pork pies.
 *rolls eyes*
 Liam I would love very much someday to hear your story of conversion to Islam from Christianity?
 Sometimes I wonder if you are actually a devout Muslim as you claim to be
  I actually converted from Christianity to agnostic because I refuse to believe in any sort of mystical man in the sky, other than Santa of course!!
 Keep wondering Matty!
 Not much to tell Dante, although I do enjoy the confusion over this Liam Egan chap!
Can we please stop wasting tax payers money to bring home this “holidaymaker”. There is a huge elephant in the room and it’s like they are all afraid the mention it. Haven’t heard a squeak from the brotherhood in Ireland because they may expose themselves.
 Interesting that you’re on here commenting during the 3rd prayer of the day. Allah is gonna be piiiiiissssed
 Matty, can’t believe you *still think* ‘Tariq’ is anything more than an extremely bad excuse for a  troll!!
 Sure I know all about him and his ways. In fact, here’s a link to one of his adverts.ie accounts :-)http://www.adverts.ie/13067513
Muslim botherhoods approach to homosexuality?
 Wow, I have a Playstation, cool!
 Yup. You have everything that one would expect the archetypal, compulsive troll to have.
 Ah now Matty, I’m flattered but I couldn’t possibly fill your boots, I mean, you’re the legend who trolls from the crack of dawn until.3.30am at night clocking up hundreds of comments per day on The Journal, some achievement!! Sadly because some of us have jobs to go to during the day we’ll always be chasing you.
 only those with something to hide fear the truth.
 Oh your job driving a dumper around Irish Cement in limerick? I presumed you’d been let go, seeing as you do so much trolling. Still a man united supporter? Amazing what one can glean from the Internet isn’t it.
 In your fantasy land Matty I can be anything you want! In fact, I know publicly declare you my concubine.
 NOBODY GIVES A SH!T ABOUT A  HOOLIGAN.
 “I know publicly declare you my concubine” Tsk Tsk Tsk. ..silly moo. You shouldn’t type so fast. Slow down, big deep breath, check your spelling and then click post. When you get all flustered, you tend to make yourself look even more stupid than usual.
 Where’s my cuppa tea sweety?
Wow 19 red thumbs. Haven’t seen that in a while..
 Whataboutery is no defence Tariq. Face the facts you $cumbag
Don’t give up on Santa Liam!Tariq will tell you Santa was MooslimWait for it…
 I wish I hadn’t updated the app, I miss seeing those red thumbs. What are the odds that they’ll sell the feature as an add-on to the app?
Leave him there. Don’t be wasting any more of my tax on him. He will be dealt with in due course by him home nation.
 I tend to agree but the delays are getting ridiculous. The only thing our government should be doing is pushing to speed that process up
 was reading facist British bulldog diatribe earlier … some of our neighbours have not moved on.  You’re not far behind.
  Things move slowly in the Egyptian System !   Strange the father never makes a plea on his behalf.
 they move slowly? Has anyone told them that? The over twenty deferred court appearances would imply that try aren’t aware that they do things slowly
  I wasn’t reading any sort fascist literature at all, British or otherwise. Unlike your good self!
 Where can I get that periodical, sounds a great read.
 I think you’ll find that the muslim brotherhood have the fascist ideology .
 : I think you’ll find that the muslim brotherhood have the fascist ideology .
 British? Explain……
 TOTALLY AGREE HE WENT THIER WITH THE INTENTION OF RUNNING AMOK. HE GOT CAUGHT
Did the people of Dublin South West elect Katherine Zappone to obsess over the welfare of this Muslim Brotherhood supporter ? Or ersatz-Muslim Brotherhood supporter –Whatever Halawa is. Focus on domestic matters Minister Zappone before sticking your beak abroad
 Hear Hear-Zappone needs to get real.If Halawas release is her main priority.There must be more pressing concerns in Dublin West-Housing Health Homelessn
 The people of Dublin South West take the shortest journey into town to save money, Zappone takes the longest journey to fiddle money.
Please keep him there.
 He’s coming home, you must be sick!
 He is home already
 There’s a Coombe Hospital in Cairo too? Who knew?!!
 It’s called the caboome
His Libyan school friend says different. Plus the Muslim Brotherhood are a terrorist organisation, but you know this already. Dhimmi
 HAHAHAHAHA CABOOME
 It’s been a while Rowe! How was your tour terrorising the people of the West Bank with your IDF buddies? Dhimmi.
 doesn’t matter where in the world he was born. As a son of two married Egyptian citizens he is a Egyptian citizen. And when he is in Egypt- well you know the rest.
 it’s also pretty cool that his father arrived over to Ireland for the first time a year after the lad was born in the Coombe …
 He is Irish but he is also an Egyptian citizen. Doesn’t matter where anyone is from. He is an Egyptian citizen on trial in Egypt.
 again that is irrelevant as he is an Irish citizen. It’s the Egyptian perspective that is key here
 Bit odd the way yourself and gregory always arrive to troll at the same time every evening between 7.30 and 9.30 Suzie?
The question is, can Tariq explain that??He’ll probably say the aul lad has a langer stretches from Egypt to Ireland, or one of his bizarre stories.
 are you talking about the gay population who are 100 % living in the closet or else they be slaughter or the tiny population of the once strong   arab Christian people  of the westbank which is heading for extinction unlike Israel which they  are growing quickly and  where gay people can there lives without a death sentence hanging over there heads unlike in  the west bank and gazza and all other Islamic countries in the region…. can never understand why far left and so call liberals never see this .
 what’s odd is you stalking others ..
 that’s true too but the other question that needs to be asked is has he been radicalized while in prison all this time ?
 in his position I think it’s fair to say he is pi$$ed off. At who thought? But we don’t know that and can’t stop his return based on that.
No doubt Suzie
Who Hamas?
 I know he can’t be stopped from coming back here but I would say he’d need to monitored …
From Ibrahim Halawa’s FaceBook page dated 27/05/2017 commenting on the Manchester atrocity:“I just really don’t know what to say. Words have run out of my mouth. My heart aches for all the families who send their loved ones smiling to a concert, only to return to them in pieces and for the families in Egypt who lost their loved ones in Minya.I pray for all the families at this heart time.”This is surprising. How come Ibrahim is allowed internet access in prison? Or is someone else (one of the 3 bail-skipping sisters?) using access on his FaceBook page?
 Was just going to ask the same question.
 Sure you were.
YepThe Muslim Brotherhood caresAre those gorgeous sisters entering the Rose of TraleeDaithi would love them. Their public speaking is brilliant. Watch YouTube to see them speak to the terrorists
I will start a go fund me for Ibrahim Halawa’s father to go to Egypt & state a case in person regarding his son’s case to the Egyptian gov.   I just think it’s time that the father went out to visit his son.   Ibrahim must be missing his dad.   Anyone willing to help with the go fund me.!
Why doesn’t varadkar show some leadership and go to Egypt and offer to take his place! Could result in a good outcome for everybody.
 You could ask the same question about any of them.Mary Lou for example. Or Gerry. Or Joan.
Thank god I was starting to get Halawa article withdrawal
I don’t think any new approach is going to influence the Egyptian’s now. Particularly as they have joined with Saudi etc against terrorists that include the Muslim Brotherhood. Papa Halawa is one of the heads of that organisation in Europe and as far as Egypt is concerned his son is also a member. The Irish government have got to accept this reality, and allow their courts to adjudicate on this. What won’t help, and what Zappone and her fellow Halawa’ites must be asked ,is why the silence from papa Halawa and the screaming sisters on the recent terror attacks. The excuse has been given, he doesn’t speak English, but the sisters do and their every word or lie is reported by a fawning media. Strange that they weren’t asked for a comment on the attacks.
 Sisi did say he can’t interfere in judicial system and rightly so. But the heroes who went on the junket a while back said he would consider release after the trial.So change of tack could be to plead guilty
Zappone is like a bad smell that you just can’t get rid of.
Last weeks Islamic terror victims aren’t even in their grave yet, and we are already back to this.
One of the Journals staff has to be banging one of the hairy sisters
 What bigots?
 Lol! What bigots he says! Priceless.
Here now, go read the mission statement of the Muslim Brotherhood and statements of its hierarchy concerning LGBT, Jews and Western Judeo Christian society, of which you are apart of, you’ll find plenty of bigotry, you absolute moron.
I can never understand why the journal allow comments on this individual while  legal proceedings are still ongoing. Agree with his detention or not, it’s always been open season on this individual on the journal.
 ara sure look it who gives a f bout him
 Egypt is not an EU country therefore the Journal.ie is not legally bound to close this comment section.
 well what about cases in the US or Australia? These countries are not in the EU and the comments are always closed.
 Stupid comment Flanagan, what about the Olympic ticket scandal in Brazil, is Brazil in the EU too? LOL!
 No-one cares about you & your stupid comments, you ISIS troll.
 You got burned Flanagan, take your medicine like a man instead of resorting to chilidsh insults.
 You will have to email the legal department of Journal.ie (if it has one!) on this subject.
 No I won’t. Your Twitter page revealed what you really are, you idiot!
 I think your comments reveal a high level of idiocy, we won’t be going to you for legal advice or geography lessons that’s for sure!
 If he was ISIS (backed by Sunnis) why would he be sticking up for Halawa who has been associated with the Muslim Brotherhood (backed by Shias)?
 Enlighten yourself, young man. Christ, you should be in the 12″ cell with your beloved poster boy Ibrahim.
Muslim Brotherhood are Sunni
 Ask Tariq your question instead, not me.
 The Troll Flanagan can’t think outside a very small blinkered narrative (see above response).
 Oi, you get back on your prayer mat! You’re supposed to be a devout Muslim observing the holy month of Ramadan at this moment. Your local imam in Bradford will be extremely disappointed by this latest act of defiance coming from you.
 Amazing comment!! Bravo sir!
 MB are sunnis ,
 Hmm, not amusing enough but do try to keep up your act & practise more until you get to become a professional comedian which you have always longed to be. Bless you, Little Tariq of Bradford.
 Thanks Flanagan, your encouragement means the world to me, bless your beautiful heart!
It hasn’t actually Jim. Irish people were told of the young lad arrested on holliers and we’re angryThen. It’s discovered from videos on YouTube and other information that the family were there to take part in a riot where countless people including cops were killed.We’ve been sold enough pups in Ireland. Halawa and his Cinderellaesque sisters are Terrorists
Approach the back of my balls, Leo.
  Don’t tempt him!
 I’d say he’d like to
Well that was a non news story , time to find out how our gallant Naval boys are getting on  ferrying , ahem I mean rescuing all those migrants/refugees .Watch the video from 5.28 min markhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ7gOtHRRT4&index=2&list=PLkqxdJDwUFJUaE2XN7ymZYVERns3cPVwE
 Why don’t we see these stories on our tv screens .White helmets are about to be outed , but we probably won’t hear that either .https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBkn78q_t_Q
They certainly are…https://twitter.com/sahouraxo/status/872502559621120007-The dogs on the street know that the White Helmets are Al Queda, but unfortunately we have too many folks that fall for the Pallywood angle.
Does anyone else find it ironic that it’s 2 gay Irish people trying to bring someone with a MB ideology , back into the country .
Halawa sisters bringing the Irish state to court for not allowing their Eygptian husbands who live in Turkey visas to live in Ireland one who is pregnant,i thought the Halawas claim they are Irish,more muslim brotherhood on the way to Ireland knowing our liberal judges,I suggest The sisters couldnt find an irish cousin to marry…
 The question is how did these 3 screeching lying sisters became Irish citizens in the first place? I hope their husbands are the genuine articles, not the Rachid Redouane types but I fear I could be wrong on this case as we all know that these 3 bail-skipping sisters are MB supporters like their dear baby bro Ibrahim. I hope the court sees sense after the Rachid Redouane business and refuse their applications to let their hubbies reside in our dear Emerald Isle.
Sinister, Leo organises a meeting of COBRA and then suggests a new approach to halawa’s freedom, sounds like an Israeli type rescue attempt.
Please no!No rescue attempts
Nothing to do with his skin colour more to do with him and his nazi pals the Moslem brotherhood – surprised a gay man would be in a hurry to try and help one of them -
 Leo’s not the only gay in town, ye know! Colm O’Gorman of Amnesty International probably has pinned a giant poster of Ibrahim on his bedroom wall as I type this.Wow, this could possibly lead into handbags at dawn between Leo & Colm over Ibrahim the MB terrorist?
 Well there’s a surprise, The Troll Flanagan is also a homophobe!
 Wait a minute, your Quran condemns homosexuality, doesn’t it? Then it makes you a hypocrite as well.Or are you really using your username as a disguise because you’re Liam of Raheen Co Limerick for real? If so, how even more pathetic of you…
He travelled to Egypt on an Egyptian passport (not an Irish one), got involved with the Muslim Brotherhood, with his fathers permission. Let him rot there. It’s an Egyptian problem not an Irish one.
PLEASE keep this Muslim brotherhood soldier over there!Halawas own Father had ties to one of the London bombers for fecks sake. His “beautiful” sisters are currently suing the Irish state (paid for by us the taxpayer)  because the State won’t let their off the shelf husbands in. These people give nothing to Irish Society. Just take,  take, takeIronic Varadker and Zappone, both LGBT work to bring the son of the Imam who believes all LGBT should be killed. Turkeys and Christmas, the new Ireland
Lazy Journalism.
 it was up all night drinking Dutch Gold and watching Babestation.
I can see the future.  Halawa is going to behead Micheal D on O Connells bridge.
How is this even in his first 100 things to do list?
I would be grateful if the Journal could do an opinion poll for us, How many dead children are worth the vibrancy that Islamic immigration brings? And seeing as multiculturalism is all about the food, how many underage girls raped are worth having a kebab shop?Answers on the back of a postcard please!
Fair enough, in the meantime will he be considering a different approach to how his party and their coalition partners address the ongoing crises in the country or will they be continuing to operate strictly in falsehoods, corruption and lack of accountability? I doubt the Halawa family have anymore faith in Leo the Liar than anyone else in Ireland.
Ok to try and be fair. He should have had his day in court by now. Considering as all he did was attend and talk at a protest. Time served if found guilty and deported. Maybe keep on watch list when he gets back here.
 Time spent will be deductable if found guilty .So if he gets 10-15 years .,he will only have to serve, 7-12 years. Then they can keep him.
 why deport him? He has dual Irish/Egyptian citizenship… they don’t have to deport him, just kick him out the prison gates.
Headline should read“Two LGBT Turkeys demand a Muslim Brotherhood Christmas”
Colm O Gorman meeting on the cards for Leo the Lion soon
 sure all she knows is abroad she’s a yank
well every human being deserves a fair trial and those prisoners held in Cuba. nobody ever  mention that not even the journal
HERE WE GO!!!!!!!!
 The article was posted an hour and a half ago, better luck next time.
 sorry pal some of us actually have lives
 next time you’re in blanchardstown gimme a shout pal I’ll buy you a coffee……… Ahem!!!
Fact check please
Nobody wants him back in this country, his family know that
Just wouldnt be a proper ibrahim post without tariq trolling it in support of islam. At least its a change from his usual speel against Catholicism. Your in Ireland now tariq. We support equal rights for women freedom of speech and dont view homosexuality as a crime. Proud to have our first openly gay leader. We can draw cartoons of whoever we like. What we cant do is marry and bed a 6 year old child bride like your prophet did. Muslim brotherhood/sharia law supporters belong in jail its just a pity the rest of his sharia law supporting friends and family avoided jail
Straight to comments. Popcorn at the ready. Now,where did I put the Kleenex……
FU)k off with this story already thought that fu(ker was on hunger strike
 pity he isn’t
I live in Egypt, We didn’t  want Halawa,he came  his videos urging the Rabea sit in for Jihad are all over the place, I am sorry the justice is very slow,but violent radicals end in places like Guantanamo jail without trial, he is a ticking time bomb,the kid is a hard core MB,his dad a coward.
 If you have any links , that would be great .
Leo should be focusing on keeping terrorists out, rather than bringing one back.
It is such a relief to live in a country where the absolute majority cherish proper judicial process and look forward to seeing Ibrahim Halawa returned home to both the city and country of his birth. I’m no fan of Fine Gael but this is a positive move by Varadkar in line with the wishes of the Irish people. Sadly there is a small number of people (I would be reluctant to even call them a minority they are so insignificant) who prefer internment without evidence or trial, these misguided fools deserve our pity, and their disappointment upon Ibrahim’s release will be a reminder of the nefarious groupings which reside among us. Chin up Ibrahim, it won’t be long now!
 Allahu akbar
 Yawn.
 I thought you lived in Bradford. I agree with you about living in a country that cherish judicial process. So why do you condemn Egypt a sovereign state that adheres to their judicial system. Just because their skin color is not the same as ours doesn’t make their courts inferior. Or are you racist on this matter by any chance.
 Hello Lizzy, welcome to our country, do you speak English? If not, no problem!
 You can be sure Egypt would be in a worse state if the MB were still there , life is hard enough for the Copts as it is .And Morsi refused to sign a U,N womens rights declaration . They don’t believe in democracy .https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/15/muslim-brotherhood-backlash-un-womens-rights
 I don’t condone it , but it might be the best of two evils .The death cult of Islam has no place here in Irish society , it has a vile and dehumanising ideology .If in your mind that is a racist thing to say , it’s you who are the bigot .It’s the ideology of fundamental islam which is the problem , not the skin colour of people coming here .Pappa Halawa has been here 20 years and hasn’t even bothered to learn English , what does that tell you about what he thinks of us ?
So they have agreed to mothing either way..usual shi@e
Supporting terrorists now are you …..
Straight to comments, popcorn at the ready,now where did I put those Kleenex……
Bonus for Christmas and now this worst mistake ever letting him in to Irish politics
Try, picking up the phone and demanding his release, this governments handling of this is quite disgraceful, if it was a mountmellick resident, Ballina native or even a Dub, now Leo’s in, this would have been sorted months, years at this stage ago. Shameful
 Really? What makes you think that?
 Actually there are several Irish residents not Muslim in jail in foreign countries…One has been in jail in Dubai for several years and one in Philippines..Joe Duffy had programme segment on then….No action from Irish government on them….
 Eanna Ó Cochláin, why don’t you look him up.
F*CK HALAWA!!!!!
We have a government and all the Muppets fighting for the Muslim brotherhood cause and yet our government can’t fix the homeless crisis along with our healthcare system well done varadkar and co you really know how to f**k it upHalawa should be left there and deport those sisters of his back to Egypt
D
..
.
Criminals the lot of them.But can you blame them when the electorate keep voting them in.
FF better increase social welfare by 10-20 euro a week for the vulnerable especially the disabled and carers or they will end up like the Labour liers. They better build social housing now and one off council houses in the countryside like they did up to the crash for those it would suit. Labour gave nothing in budget 2015 &16 when government had money to spend and throw the most vulnerable under the bus even though an election was coming up. FF will be like Labour are now if they don’t deliver for the poorest in this “new politics”
 FF aren’t in Govt so it will be FG who will shape the budget. Social Welfare system needs urgent reform, with a move to a tapered system based on contributions for all able bodied. With special assistance given to the 30k+ claiming dole who have never worked
 “FF aren’t in Govt so it will be FG who will shape the budget”LOL! FF still blaming everyone else, even when they’re propping up the Tories in power.
 FF aren’t in government???? What planet do you live on? It might not be called a coalition government but that’s exactly what we currently have. Tories propping up Tories.
 FF are as much in government as FG is. FF like mouthing off on issues, having hissy fits for public consumption. But when push comes to shove, the establishment rules. That’s what it’s all about. The establishment comes first.
 the confidence and supply agreement is just that, not coalition
 Who do you reckon believes you at this stage, stephen?
 They won’t have to increase it because Leo’s gonna reduce it.
 Private individuals are vastly more efficient than government at distributing wealth. Government and the tax system are a scam.
And the Irish people have no reason to trust anyone of them
 The deal done was, Leo gets Taoiseach job and qualifies for pension and a car for life, Then after the summer break Mehole becomes outraged and calls for an election for his car and pension for life.Carry on Minions.
 Micheal, after the INCORRECT COMMENTS from Frances Fitzgerald today about the source of the Islamic attacks SHE HAS TO GO. ISIS =wahabbi Sunni muslims. Shia Muslims ZERO attacks.
 all trueAnd the haggert bobby has to sweat it out tillSeptember then she can sail off with humongous  pension
Well done Mick.Fine Fail instrumental in electing two Fine Gael taoisigh in a row.Who’d have ever thunk that eh? Civil War politics must be over.
 Reunited and it feels so good, ~~ Reunited cause we’ve understood.
Of course Mehole …Maintain the status quo , eh ?
 who would you have in?
Martin is a disgrace. It took labour to bring attention to the whistle blower enquiry, further investigation into the Anglo case and no tax for aib bank for the next 30 years. Martin is happy to go along with the corruption and the status quo. If he was doing his job properly, he’d have called an election long ago and bring this shambolic fg gov down. FF and FG are colluding to ensure at least one of them is in gov.
And this is not new politics. This is just a cozy arrangement between the two biggest and most corrupt political parties in the country. If support for both of them remains weak, they don’t want an election as it invites other perties to move in and gain some support and power.
Eh any chance the voting population might be afforded the chance to say who they want as Taoiseach ??
Leo you don’t bring up the 50k in my wife’s account again, which I must emphasis was only resting there, and I won’t call for an election.
“He said Fianna Fáil continues to be a party that promotes “fairness and decency”Don’t you have to be doing something to be able to continue it?
The face on cowen, it looks like he’s trying stop himself from laughing
An Irish citizen locked up in Egypt without trial  for 4 years???? First i heard of it and I’m on the journal daily. Perhaps the journal could write a bias piece on it
 As someone who travels to some doggy spots I also find this a bit worrying, I only hope it’s because he is brown in colour and not a pale freckled red head like my self. If I was in he’s situation I would expect the FCA to invade Egypt and come to my rescue at a minimum.
Opposite cheeks of the same sleveen backside, destroying our parliamentary process by conspiring to deny the Irish people a true opposition in the Dail.Roll on the next election….
Micheal. .give Leo the  “free ride”…by propping up a FG government yet again..  and you will be annihilated into the history books..as insignificant…politics hurts!  not what you’re forebears would have done ..and the irish public will not thank you!Yours   to lose  and yours to gain..think long and hard!
FF muppets keeping this unelected character as the country’s leader instead of having an election to clear the air from the Kenny disasters. Devious, lying, self-serving crooks.
 So basically your saying we should have every year. That would really get things done.
Let’s judge Leo based on how the gauntlet falls upon him as Taoiseach…and how he reacts to that.Time alone will be his judge….not the so very many lickarse and so very nauseating and typical Irish political sound bites and PR emulation…the  “give us a job Leo”…brigade…that we have heard to date!
Well coalition partners ought to trust each other.
The FGF Party.
The Endapendents are all looking for something for their own constituencies, parish pump politics again. sod the country as long as their constituencies are looked after, god im sick of this kip of a country.
FF BETTER get 10-20 increase in social welfare in budgets as most vulnerable disabled and carers got nothing from the Labour liers in 2015& 16 when government had money to spend. They looked after the unionised civil service and only increased min wage by absolute buttons. FF better get social housing built now and one off council houses in the countryside for those that it would suit like before the crash. FF will end up like the Labour liers if they don’t deliver foe thw needy in this “new politics”
 what a load of shit. How about some tax cuts for hard pressed workers funding all this ridiculous social welfare, and getting nothing in return??
‘Not another red cent.’Duh!
The establishment conspiring to impose a Taoiseach on us from FG, the party that is destroying society. Fully supported by the party that destroyed the economy, FF.FG have no mandate. Varadkar, has even less of a mandate from the members of FG.Such is democracy in the corrupt cesspool of Ireland that the establishment parties of FF/FG/Lab will do anything to keep the gravy train of corruption going.
 If only we had an alternative to these clowns
 If only we had real meaningful democracy.
Good to see Zappones priorities are aligned with everyone else, eh
Well, if a member of the previous  Fianna Fáil cabinet thinks he’s trustworthy, that’s good enough for me.
We need massive political reform this is not how a country should be run deals in back rooms and political favours for support. We need an election.
Dark Vader is going to Force us all to pay for everything.
“ensure kenny gets a satisfactory send off”. What a shower of absolute gobs@#$es!
Bring back Enda…at least he wasn’t a crook, like Calelly, Haughey, Burke, Flynn, Ahern, O’Keeffe and the rest…
 you are having a laugh? Right?
 you can lump that useless goat in with the first lot you mentioned. Edna isn’t staying on for the good of the country.
 There is not many left to vote for
God help us how did it ever come to this .We all want a strong leader instead we get Leo Veradcar . Will life be worth living under Leo. We all know the answer to that. We are stuck with this blue shirt right wing mad man. I suppose he will promise the moon and the stars. But we all know we are just getting a shit storm.
Actions​ speak louder.government is doing nothing but increasing the cost of living and their salaries,and FF are sitting back thinking they will benefit.they won’t,avoid voting FF fg labour in any election.

Martin you coward.Call an election.
Politics, the art of saying the opposite to what you actually meant.
Since fianna fail PRO steven mentioned people getting things for nothing, Everyone should Google steven kearon “special deal” with fianna Fail minister Dick Roche.
As far as i know, this is how “democracy” works: The banking system gives the political parties a “loan” to win the elections. This “loan” isn’t called in unless they do something the banks don’t like…. Simple… I heard this from a former Israeli politician.
I suggest everyone Google fianna Fail PRO steven kearons “special deal” he had going with fianna Fail minister Dick Roche.Since he has a horn for people who supposedly get money for nothing!
Pity we can’t say the same about you lot……
100 years of FF, FG, Labour and surely there has to be another alternative?such a crooked system, no accountability by any political party
H
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah….. Blah blah blah…. blah blah blah… Blah.
Time to pull the plug and be eather in government or sit on the fence.
Simon Harris 12 months after the St John of God topups broke we have The damming HSE Audit millions involved at the taxpayer funded Charity . Not a comment from the minister although he set up investigation into Sumbeam House . Come on Simon comment.
 I think that he’s waiting to get his Confirmation out of the way before he makes a comment. I’d say he’ll get loads of dosh on the day. He’s a grand lad.
The IA and FFbetter raise social welfare and keep the vulnerable waiting 5 months for increase. Both these better drI’ve hard bargain or they will go same way as the Labour liers
 not keep vulnerable waiting
 Ind Alliance had a very constructive and satisfactory meeting with Leo. Of course they did, they were told their pay and pensions are safe.
“he has made it clear to Varadkar that the careers of his supporters should not suffer.”Eh, since when does the loser in a leadership contest get to dictate to the party leader re cabinet positions. Give up the sanctimonious act Simon.
 SC shouldn’t venture an opinion?
 He won the majority of party members and a number of TDs may find themselves with awkward selection conventions if he doesn’t get listened to.
 When by some strange mechanism the loser gets almost 3 times the number is votes then the “winner”
 I assume the membership voted in that electoral college though. Assume
 the TDs are way more representative of the country than the Fine Geal members are.
That’s all they care about, career. F U my career is more important. These effin right wing dirtbags couldn’t give a toss about Joe public
Leave him as Minister for Health. That should be punishment enough.
 Punishment to whom? The Public?
 hi Phil. Bad idea. Patients are dying as Harris won’t keep his promises. He won’t even speak to the people he made the promise too.  We lost another person to sarcoma at the weekend. See Facebook.com/sarcomaireland
 Hi Cathal. Apologies if my post seemed trite. I think that healthcare in Ireland needs root and branch reform. I don’t believe that under current structures the Minister for Health has the ability to affect much change, even if they want to. The last Minister who stayed in Health for a long period- voluntarily- was Mary Harney. Many political creatures, before and after, have done their stint in health and then vamoosed before their political reputations were ruined. Take the newest Fine Gael leader as an example.
 thanks Phil. Fully understand. Our issue is a promise was made and broken. It’s a very discouraging thing when you can’t trust a government minister. Very sad for families directly affected.
I think simon should grow up and expect politicians to get jobs on performance and competency, not who they support. What a privileged fantasy land he lives in!Maybe this statement just shows how they think and operate, ie: its nothing to do with ability, its about who manages to get elected and then subsequently who’s inside and outside their little club.
Why wouldn’t Leo be magnanimous in victory? he doesn’t have a huge spread of talent to choose from…Noonan is now gone as is the glorious leader.
 Harrisbhas achieved more in Health than Leo. Even Reilly did. Leo brought in penalties for not buying health insurance as his mate was buying a hospital at a knock down brief whilst borrowing from the FG bank.
 probaly leave Harris in Health as punishment for backing coveney
65% of FG supporters wanted Coveney and they got Varadkar. Sounds about right for FG.
Careers? are these guys insane? Harris should be fired with his record in health alone.
Harris is screwing up his career without any help from anyone…and for that as always in this little cesspit of a country will be rewarded,and that is a fact.There was a time when I used to be proud to be Irish,but the last twenty years of government has made be very bitter and I am not likely to change anytime soon.It is a cesspit…and it is not going to get better.
It would be nice if ministers were appointed because they could do the job effectively. …..We can but dream!
I am as clever a man as you will ever meet…dyslexia doesn’t affect self-esteem…
An chance being an terrible politician might damage his political career?
No such worries from me , health service is in tatters ;
When you pick the wrong horse your career will suffer just ask John Paul Phelan. Anyway he doesn’t need Leo to ruin his political career he’s well able to do that himself.
 did Leo no harm last time out when he didn’t support Enda
More nonsense and a smoke screen for the Gullible Gallery assisted by the fawning Irish Media.Varadker showing faux concern for continuing allegiance for Independent group remaining in Government under his leadership.These politicans ( in Government and opposition) have only one real principled policy and that is to stay in office as long as possible knowing full well the pot of gold i.e Big Pensions and hugh lump sums are almost within immediate grasp. I suppose you could term it the Sinn Fein / Me Fein factor which is theone indistinguishable common  penchant inherent in all the current crop of politicians on all sides (be they male or female).  At least in these  important financial matters you have equality of mindset between all the sexes! No Equality Bill needed only Dollar bills.
It would be absolutely pointless reshuffling health minister roll currently- just when someone starts getting momentum in a job the government order reshuffles…
With the Dáil to break this week! What is that all about?  You can tell the place is full of ex teachers not wanting to give up their summer holidays. How about hang around to the end of the month and do some work.
Constructive meeting means their seats are safe as far as these parasites are concerned.
All for the Parish
So they kept their jobs then
Did you ever see Turkeys voting for Christmas
Simon should go get a job tossing burgers or something he is actually good at.
Shane Ross got a hand shandg
Bit late for that
LV : are ye in for a few ministerial cars?IA:  fckn sure we are.Meeting concluded
One a#sehole shouting out another one….
Bono is the second Messiah.He cosies up to world leaders and third rate political leaders.
One a tax dodger and the other aids and abets tax dodging —-aib for instance
Jesus…felt a bit sick there
Chieftain of our country?! Or in English… the prime minister. Total muppet.
 Well the literal translation of Taoiseach is ‘Chief leader’ as far as I am aware.
Cringeworthy…
Two ends of the same……..,insert expletive here.
 ballbag
Bono has no credibility with Irish people.
Great to see Ireland being promoted abroad. All helps us get a better profile encouraging foreign investment in Ireland.
Any chance it was sarcasm?
 Hope so Lily!
Two gobsh&tes
I know it’s only a side matter in the article but I found Kenny’s statement about “avoiding the scientific accuracy of the facts” in regard to climate change a little ironic given that many climate change advocates aren’t too keen on highlighting the scientific fact that the earth’s climate continually cooled from 2000-2014 which they did incidentally by replacing the term “global warming” with “climate change” the latter being an inconvenience for government green tax pushers. Lol.
You dont live here bono so stfu
Pay Yer income tax here a fvck up Bono, good man
 he actually does.
 is that to the Netherlands?
Typical  Bono..   Totaly intoxacated by  the  exuberance of  his rearend verbosity …
One waster mouthing praise for a another one
Graceful????More like greasy
Two fiddlers at the same gig.
two of a Kind…. man of the people Enda…https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JD25qe9yJE
Kenny and the wife having a f–king ball on TAX payers money, he is payed to much and he bailed every last  big shot out bar the hard pressed Irish people, hope this is the last we hear of him.
 paid even!What a mouthful of garbage!
He’s no chieftain of mine..neither is that little runt either..
A shout out from one prize pr¡ck to another!!!
Bono you are a useless little worm. If you want to dispute I will either kick 16 types of shit out of you or debate your crimes against the people of Ireland.
 ur a plantpot
 That you bono?
Some of us actually pay tax ..We funded Enda’s lap of honour
Awful eejet
U2 were once so cool. Now they’re so sad.
Too , to and twoPs Pox bottle best expression ever
I guess his curic measurements increased recently
 Dec 11 2011, Bono being interviewed by Huckabee on FoxNewsHuckabee: “You done a remarkable job, I want to say thanks on behalf of all human beings around the world for… Advocacy that has led to the saving of literally millions of lives and I wish you the very best and aaa, one other thing. You have a knack for getting people of wide political variances together, we might need you to run forPresidency.”Bono: “I’m going to say, that would be a very scary moment for the world, Mmmm.You on the other hand, I think would bring thee, the Reagan like statesmanship that’sSo missing.”
Of course Bono praises the politician whose salary his tax dollars don’t pay.
F off Bono what a prat …Graceful leader my arse
Firstly I want to say I greatly admire U2 , their music and phenomenal success. However when Bono praises the leader of a political party that betrayed it’s people for personal enrichment, I feel nauseated. Ordinary Irish citizens have been abused bullied and oppressed by these politicians, financial institutions etc. Has Bono ever expressed compassion for the families destroyed by these people, has he taken time notice the amount of suicide and mental health issues imposed on defencless Irish citizens ? I doubt it, we live in an Ireland and EU which is degraded and corrupt, and primarily functions to serve the haves and not the most vulnerable.
i love u2s music but bono should keep his nose out of politics !!!
There are events on every weekend at the RDS – I don’t see why this BS is given so much air time. The chap is a Donal trump when it comes to getting free media attention
 clearly some spin in there. i would’ve thought the headline should be that the Dublin conference community attracted a major financial sector conference. rather than Paddy claiming to be some charitable messiah rattling on about bringing it to their hometown. who does he think he is? bono or something even more irritable.
 really?1.5m in access to students who would otherwise have to pay for the same conference in another city.Plus more exposure to the city as a financial hub.You really have a problem with this?What’s you’re alternative?
 Great news for Irish people especially young, bad news for Anti Prosperity types.
This Paddy Cosgrove guy is starting to annoy me
 annoys me too, with all its problems web summit was a success because of its location, and he’s picked his moment now to save face and make money as soon as possible.
€1.5 million in tickets – so maybe 10 tickets?
 And it will still probably be oversold by 50%
Ahhhh, he should be beatified like AIB for giving that couple on their new ad a mortgage!Did it not work out in Portugal?Was their ‘Wifi’ not as marvellous as ours?Did it turn out profit there was a tenth of what it was here?Do tell Paddy, do tell!! We wait with baited breath……
 It’s not the Web Summit coming  it’s Moneyconf which started  in Belfast before going to Madrid
Wasn’t aware JP Morgan were moving 1000 bankers from London to Dublin. Thought they agreed office space for up to 1000 to include the 500 staff already here! Paddy needs to check his facts.
 a thousand bankers sounds so much more dramatic. Perhaps we can think of a word to describe a thousand bankers.A maelstrom of bankers? A megaswarm of bean counters? A moshpit of moola movers?
 A thousand gangsters
 it’s a Nonsense of bankers
and the vast majority of those jobs are low value with churn at the lower levels in the industry at over 30% according to citibank
 the collective term for bankers is a “wunch”
 they are renting one of them them 7 new buildings currently in construction in capitol dock at the port
Great news. Hopefully the hotel’s don’t up the prices and send it to another country again….
 yeah Paddy was responsible for that, his company booked the hotels and resold them to attendess at marked up prices
 Didn’t know that Ian..
 bizarre statement about Enda
 That seems to be to get free publicity. Otherwise no one would care.
 supply and demand.
 Artificial or not, it is still called “supply and demand.”
 all statements about him are bizarre
Nothing  anywhere else hence return with tail between said legs
Run em to f..kIreland’ wasn’t good enough for themNow they come crawling back
 We are like this stupid ladies beaten and abused by their fellas but always ready to forgive and welcome them back if they ask..
He made a haimes of running this event in Portugal, odds are it will go wrong in Madrid too, so back to Ireland he comes, where people will accept his b.s. about how none of the organisational problems are his fault.
Fantastic, Gamercon for grown-ups, where do my visa card and I sign up?
Paddy and his minions need to flockoff… Back to Lisbon with ye! Nothing to see here
Well timed?
Theresa May calling it a “terrible incident”. Merkel condemning “all forms of terrorism”. It seems like the most important thing at a time like this is not to hurt Muslims feelings by using the term Islamic terrorism.
 many areas in Ireland are unsafe for women, many women in Ireland live in unsafe situations, many are subject to regular violence, some are killed – it has nothing, whatsoever, to do with Muslim men.
 but if we continue to allow hoardes of Muslim men in it will become a problem
 Whatever you may think of Muslims, this hate crime has nothing to do with religion or the fact that most Muslims living in Britain live their lives peacefully and intergrate into normal life among other Britons. A few headbangers out of control cannot be blamed on religion in any shape or form.

 Idiotic statement.
 Possibly the most ridiculous statement ever posted on the Journal and that’s some feat.
 head in sand syndrome.
 I don’t remember IRA or UVF members being described as Irish or Northern Irish terrorists. As they did not represent all Irish people, no more than a few murderous psychopaths with swords do all muslims.
 I gave an example that I live and see with my own 2 eyes every day above as to how this religious way of life is incompatible with progressive European ideas. It for sure is not the people its the book.
 This is what happens when Country’s open their borders to all and welcome them there’s  always some who flourish and move into terrorism and this is what we are seeing now This Country is also at risk because of the checks not been tough enough at the start.
 Maybe you’re too young but I well remember it
 are you saying the whole of Paris is a no-go area @ night?
 Very true, however they were often refered to as Catholic or Protestant which is unfair on the rest of society trying to make Ireland a better and more peaceful place for everyone.
 Is that what you call it…..
 Vast numbers of Muslims don’t integrate. In fact there’s been more segregation in recent years. Large parts of English cities now look like Islamabad. The shop fronts are Islamabad. The dress code is Islamabad. Men are hanging around and women are pretty much invisible.Most of these people will never harm anyone, but it’s willfully stupid not to see that there’s a problem here.
 The problem is with political parties in Britain like Ukip and the Tories stirring up racial tensions in places where migration hasbeen welcome overthe decades. British people have always been regarded as tolerant of people from other countries until the brexit referendum made outsiders feel less welcome. Britain has always supported a mixed race society and has integrated with Muslim & Hindu commonwealth members including India and Pakistan. Theresa May’s government has turned Britain int
 I’m sorry but that’s nonsense. These changes predated the May government. Even if it didn’t, what exactly has persuaded entire areas to turn themselves into exclaves of Pakistan and Bangladesh? You see nowhere that looks like an exclave of Mumbai.
 i think the idea is to reduce violence whatever way possible Peter. Importing groups of people who cause mayhem isn’t rational, even when there are some exceptions amongst them.
The usual anti-Muslim bullshit here. The majority of Muslims people are decent honest hard working people. I know I live with them. Everybody is so concerned when this happens in London or Paris or Manchester. Names and pictures in the lousy papers who laud over it for weeks to sell their rags. When it happens in Kabul or Baghdad as it did last  week it  doesn’t rate. The simple truth is Britain and their pals created this hate. They had no trouble bombing Libya and Iraq back to the stone age and then running away from the mess. These idiots gave these nutters this cause so now they have nowhere to run. People in Ireland are safe because they is no history of bring in any of these stupid wars.
@ Peter. Good man Peter you absolute idiot. Thank god we didn’t have people like you fighting for England, America and Russia in the 1940s you coward. We would all be living the dream of the 1000 year Reich now if we did. Wake up man.
 Fair comment but let’s stop Ireland from putting our future generations at risk
 you do know why these ‘headbangers’ are committing these acts yes?
 youbsay brexit as if it was imposed by the ruling government. The people voted for it. The same people you think integrate well.
 Peter there are too many people that do what you have just done.We are talking about a radical ideology that has no purpose in the western world other than to rape murder and kill, now we all know that every county has had there own problems well before we start dealing with the threat of Muslim terrorists.But one thing we cannot do and sadly people like you continue to do is divert opinion  from the MAIN cause of the problem by saying “well we have had these problems before or not all Muslims are to blame” no one is blaming all muslims but it shocks me that people can’t see what is right in front of there faces.Radical Islam is a huge problem that needs to be tackled head on, fight fire with fire.God damm leftist apologists need to cop on take there heads out of the sand.
 actually Karl I do
In London First responders shot suspects dead within eight minutes of the emergency call. Are we well prepared Leo? If not, why not?
 man isn’t even in office yet.
 THE JOURNAL.IE CENSOR PEOPLE WHO GO AGAINST THE LIBERAL MULTICULTURAL  NIGHTMARE. I’M OUTTA HERE.
  My messages also, this is snowflake central. Goodbye journal.ie.
 We could give u a  gun, seems u want to shoot someone, grow up,,
 We live in a country where gangland criminals are better resourced than our national police force, so the answer to your question is no.
 Don’t go – how will it survive without your insightful input>?
Goodbye, you won’t be missed.
 Do you think that the Garda are under prepared, where is your evidence. Garda often deal with gun and knife crimes.
 only decent response to Fionnula’s comment… I thought I was the only one that understood what she meant.. thanks John
 The problem here is in 8 minutes a lot of killings and wounding’s can take place. The attackers did’nt care. they were just intent on killing as many as possible .They knew they would be shot, that did’nt bother them. they welcomed it. Martyrdom was the purpose , killing the infidels, no matter where you find them will in their warped mind get them their numerous virgins for eternity. With mindsets like that, It’s near impossible to stop them.
 why is Leo being asked? He’s not Taoiseach and if after this week he is he’s not 70+% of the Irish people’s.
 which is why we need to stop importing them.
Ireland are dream walking if its people keep their head in the sand and pretend that it will never happen here. Irish Gov couldn’t run Tayto Park for a day and God forbid there was an attack here. The wonderful Nurses in our hospitals can’t even cope with a flu epidemic.
 so true unfortunately. The country is mismanaged day to day I dread to think WHEN it happens in Dublin
 Totally Seamus. Enough is enough of this effing Siht. Bunch of hunts hanging around the Point Depot at concerts not selling a thing but watching everything. And F the person that wants to disagree with me when children are going into a concert
 There hasn’t been an attack by Islamist terrorists in Ireland – or the majority of other countries.
 Seamus, it’s lovely that you’ve found out how to use the internet and all, but do you think you could stop sharing that link please? I’ve seen it a dozen times in these comments, your point is pretty clear, give it a wee rest now.
Don’t be so thick Peter you have to know that Islam is incompatible with Western life
 well said Mike. Go back to bed Peter you useless dimwit troll.
 just over 1% of the population of Ireland is Muslim. 64,000 approx. We are not involved in any bombings in Syria, Iraq or anywhere for that matter. Why would they target Ireland? Why haven’t they targeted Ireland?
 What’s your point? An attack on any country is too much .Stop trying to defend the terrorists.
Unfortunately it is a certainty that Ireland will be attacked at some point in the future. Jihad against the western infidel doesn’t recognise borders. Catholicism makes us a prime target. It’s time to accept that fact.
 The vast majority of these attackers are home grown. So immigration has nothing to do with it.
Stephen there are plenty of countries that have no involvement in Iraq and Styria. Thailand and Phillipines pop to mind. Just google Islamic terrorism around world and you see the lovely influence of Mohammad.
 Did were involved in wars with the Muslim countries though
 You didn’t answer my question on why would they attack Ireland? The Manchester attack was by a British national so immigration policies would not have prevented it.
 Philippines and Thailand both have disgruntled Muslim minorities who have been in conflict with the majority culture for years over a number of issues. There have been sporadic outbursts of violence in both countries regarding these issues for a long time. Neither country is a new arena for such attacks
And there you have it Anne “disgruntled Muslim minorities”. And that’s only two countries I pointed out. What about the other 30 to 40?
 You still, again didn’t answer my question as to why would they attack Ireland?
You are an idiot. Why would they attack Ireland? Same reason they’d attack Sweden or anywhere else who aren’t involved in war — because we’re “disbelievers”. I’m sure they’d probably mention something about Shannon as well..We also don’t want our country going the same was as Belgium, France, Sweden, Germany… Muslim ghettos, unwillingness to assimilate, parallel societies, attacks on women and children… Mass Muslim immigration fails every single time. The pattern will NEVER change.Your lack of knowledge and research on the topic is embarrassing.
 because we are infidels in their eyes thats enough reason for them to attacks us..!!
Flanagan is in no position to say Ireland is safe.  And he’s in a government that continues to pump Muslims into our country.
That’s nonsense.  Their parents were immigrants.And the ones coming in now have children, throngs of them.  Jihadis 2050 style.
 Total bollix
 yep that’s the real problem we don’t have a thing to deal with any of this . They haven’t attacked Ireland because there is nothing relevant here . But one of them head the balls may decide go for Shannon or dublin and the government imported a whole lot of refugees for which they will have no provisions . Park them and hope for the. Eat is what foment anger . Idle hands and all the rest . People with time to think allies to people of similar mind . That’s how it happen . Disgruntled home red is the behind picture in every one of those attacks that’s the key to prevent and we got nada!
And the Naval taxi service will continue to pick up the 1000s every week   spreading across the Mediterranean to Europe from Libya etc . Why can you simply stroll into Europe while if you or I wanted to Emigrate to USA, Canada or Australia it takes months of paperwork. Time to say enough is enough and let them sort their own problems out before it becomes ours.
 in fairness it was Europe and America that caused and still cause most of the problems and conflicts in the Middle East
 The *governments* caused this sh*t not people but the people are paying for it. Time to put an end to it. Close the borders.
 name the refugees that caused this? Oh no they were born in Britain.
 born in Britain to immigrants. Stop the immigrants – stop the born in Britain terrorists.
 Jaysus Deborah you’d make a great lawyer , The bombers father was a refugee who brought his ideology with him and passed it on down the line to his kids .Remind you of anybody closer to home ?
 And who elected the governments?
Roy Dowling. Well the people of Ireland did not elect this present government.
 the Manchester bomber was allowed into U.K. as his daddy was fighting Gadaffi. He is not a Brit. Daddy went home and left this clown behind him. We need leadership now to make the non PC decisions. Leo won’t do that. Too many bleeding hearts on this island
“in fairness it was Europe and America that caused…”In more fairness it wasn’t Ireland.So; why are having to take in throngs of Muslims?
The first priority for any government is to keep its streets and citizens safe. This is the 3rd terrorist atrocity in UK in less than 3 months. Mrs May and her administration must bear some degree of responsibility as the Conservative Party have slashed 10 thousand police officers. If I was eligible to vote next Thursday this would be weighing very heavily on my mind.
 what about the labour mayor of london. What has he done to keep london safe. UK mayor has a lot more powers than most.
 Khan has banned scantily clad women on posters on the underground.
 oh and he stated that islamistattacks are part and parcel of city living, nice.
 for God’s sake how is a government responsible for the actions of lunatic behavior, years ago we had war, people new their enemy, this goes back to Bush administration and Mrs, Merkel has a big part to play in the whole affair, just my opinion
 A good start in how to keep our people safe from this toxic ideology is to prevent Islam getting a foothold in Ireland.
 These attacks are being carried out to coincide with UK Elections.
 Watch the Daily Mail link this and Corbyns answer to the would he fire trident.
 Where is he going to fire it? Into the city of London?
 birmingham ?
 religion has no place in society as it is ignorance personified
It’s called consequence Anne.You cannot bomb the crap out of the middle east and not expect consequences.
Money is the fuel ISIS thrives on. Boycott their shops and businesses.Freeze their assets and bank accounts. Cut them off
 Thanks for sharing that link 4 times.
 I never saw this article or take on things, it’s interesting. Food for thought. So yes, thanks to him for sharing it 4 times.
 indeed! Is his issue terrorism or Muslims?
 Many invoked in Islamist terrorism are known to the authorities. They need to be dealt with decisively and removed from circulation.
 Both seem to go hand in hand at the moment.
 what can you buy in an isis shop.?Burqas,ak47s,cans of oil,?
 I hear they sell Vans now
 that’s the last time I go to that ISIS Tesco on Leonard’s corner!
 Good suggestion. Needs to be shared more.
 A link in every home
We have two problems here, the extremists & the apologists, for example, Brendan Cooney, yesterday, explained on another related topic, that we have never been safer… What you got to say now Cooney.
I am completely sure that the 4,000+ Muslims arriving in Ireland to join the 60,000 already here will not contain any jihadi types
 trying to stir up hatred and fear will continue nothing positive.
 keep loving Islam and hating Christianity Tony….at least you are consistent
Apologists like you Tony continually use what’s happening in the Middle East as justification for these terrorists attacks so it will hardly be a surprise that people in the West might get fed up with your Islamic buddies
https://youtu.be/_vUrAMxmO_A
Tony is the most drab poster I’ve ever come across. Contributes nothing of use and never offers any solutions.Wouldn’t mind if he was a *good* troll (like that other weirdo Tariq can be at times), but he’s just boring and repetitive. Go on Tony, give us a reply; I’m ready for my afternoon siesta ;D
 what your solution bring in more so called children who shave and are clearly older than they look, they where on the tv and stating they are board down in middle of now where they want to be near cities  and whats going to happen they will  vanish and reappear in uk or europe, the bleed hearts and lefties are responsible for europe being a target no 1!
We Dont Need Vigils We Need Action,Arrest,Deport And Cancel Citizenship to any known symphatisers,Oh Sorry You Would infringing their civil liberties And they would be at risk if they were deported,but it would be ok to harm the people of Ireland,looney liberals have the world screwed..
 I find the British approach of better intelligence, calmness, preparation, proportionality and a sense of composure to be a better approach.
@tony Daly,ya it’s obviously working great for them.
 they handle it as well as it can be handled. They won’t be vanquished. They will retain their free society.
 yeah it’s working a treat.
Plus ca change. So reminiscent of appeasement and the Nazis.Can’t intern. Can’t take DNA. Can’t deport. Can’t have deradicalization programs. Can’t arm the police. Can’t take one politically incorrect step, regardless of efficacy, so the ‘solutions’ are invariably anodyne variants of kumbaya
We had an ISIS recruiter in the country that couldn’t be deported for God sake. Fighters returning from Syria walking the streets of Europe. After the German attack the most wanted terrorist in Europe was just strolling across borders. Europe is a soft target because the laws effectively tie the police’s hands behind their backs. Unfortunately i cant see things changing anytime soon.
Action speaks louder than tweets.
Wonder where the “keep an open mind” apologists are today. makes my blood boil . time to have armed Gardai presence on the streets to reassure people.
 Reassure people from what exactly
 What he meant that similiar incidents like what had happened in London last night may happen on the streets of Dublin in future. You knew what purple rain was talking about before you typed in your comment here.
And Muhammad is the highest climbing name here so basically as a society we are like a ticking time bomb until something happens here
 rubbish, it is at #83 so far from even the top 50 names which is due to only 84 children up from 56 or 58 last year. Please don’t repeat facts or claims made by other journal commenter as there is a serious lack or knowledge and ignorance on matters spewed about here daily. To make such a claim should in the very least take 1 minute to verify it before further perpetuating inaccurate information.
“fully in control of the situation”.Hospitals can’t cope with an outbreak of the flu, public transport grinds to a  halt with an inch of snow on the ground.I dread to think of the chaos if an attack happened here.
A whole slew of politicians, including half the Irish cabinet, out shouting and condemning this but what’s all this self important  soundbiting gonna achieve. Trying to make themselves look authorative till the next attack comes. Actions speak louder than words. Actions are scarce with these politicians. No shortage of words.
the irish goverment are living in cloud cokoo land, our guarda are in crisis with no leader both commissioner and minister who are looking after each other, our defence forces have been stripped of experience of counter terrorism experience that they gained over the troubles, and just if they shoot any of these terrorist what do you think would happen, Colm O’Gorman along with human rights groups and the left would be outraged, why did they shoot why couldn’t they use other force, then we would have an enquiry into what happened the a guard or soldier would be held accountable, thats would happen in little oul ireland,  i am afraid the horse has bolted and our country has been sold a pup on emigration into this country, 50 to 100 years from now we will reap the rewards our culture will be gone!! and there will be ghettoes where certain groups live.
Mr Khan said that there is “no justification”. Of course there is not. Another stupid comment. His comments are cause for continuous concern for me.
 is that not the same muppet who said that we should accept to live in turbulent times, or something close to it, after he was elected ?With “leaders” like that – who accept something that is unacceptable, future of the Europe is very dark.
 terror attacks were according to his 2016 interview “part of living in big city”So if a leader of major world city has approach like that… Sheep is leading sheeps….http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/sadiq-khan-london-mayor-terrorism-attacks-part-and-parcel-major-cities-new-york-bombing-a7322846.html
 What he said in that article is mostly common sense. Try reading beyond the misleading headline.
 common sense that has zero translation into real life. Another name for that type of common sense speech is “talk shyte”. We need politicians with balls who can stand up and defence European values, not politically correct spineless cowards who all they do is to unite in pain and sending condolences letters to everyone when the murders happen.
We need to remove religious instruction from all schools and anyway it is illegal under the Irish constitution and international law.
 Because religious instruction in Irish schools lead to terrorism?? Think you are on the wrong thread
The P C brigade is on it way out look what it’s taken for Governments to take Action.Take great care when letting strangers into your life.Ignorance is not bliss.My thoughts and prayers are with the people of Britain
 doesn’t seem to be working out for them recently ,don’t you think ?
It’s working as well as it can be
The British demonstrate a civic mindedness, a sense of composure and fortitude. Britain was and continues to be a bastion of liberal enlightenment and decency.As many of the witnesses to the horror and carnage said, they will not allow their values and their lifestyle to be changed by this.I was in London and Manchester the previous weekend. It was obvious that the terrorists will not succeed in their agenda in Britain because the British attitude is one of prevailing and getting on with life. There is a strong culture of getting on with life and not bowing to the terrorist agenda. It is admirable.
 Why don’t you stay there seen as you love it so much.
Explain thAt to the families of those slaughtered in the name of Allah you idiot Daly
 that sort of excitability and drivel contrasts with the British phlegmatic approach.
 I live and work in Ireland but most of my family live in Britain.
Here’s a Brit who was never afraid to call it as it was. Admirable intellect and bravery to face down the fanatics and their apologists.https://youtu.be/HHwvT4Xl5Uo
 i will admit they had the balls to vote out of the EU. So on that from i agree with you. Now they need to finish the job.
 Finish the Job ? How do they deal with their own citizens?
Charlie say The Gardai have it under control!! That made me laugh! They do in me hoop!
 Roy, would you at the very least agree that anyone coming to Ireland who is not on board with gay rights or freedom of expression and a love of democracy should maybe be told “No mate this ain’t the place for you!” Or should everyone come to Ireland?You should listen to this from 3:30 minshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l91JHc9-FeI&t=327s
The cops in Ireland couldnt catch the clap off a ten spot hewer, never mind a sophisticated underground terror network.
Armed cops were in position and shot the attackers dead within 6 minutes… And they were too late. Imagine it happened here!!
 They murdered poor Margaret Hassan, when she went out to help them.
What’s madness is we keep electing the same ignoramus politicians every time and we’re expecting a different result.
 maybe we should look into  inducing  sharia laws into the  irish constitute to make it more inclusive to Irelands rapidly expanding    moslim population  which would be determinedly bad for gay and women’s rights a unseen result of liberal and hard left agenda. ..
 I think Deborah can’t see anything wrong with Islam , as they aren’t against abortion .Nothing else matters it would appear .
The Gardai can’t even control our own gangland problem. They wouldn’t stand a chance against ISIS fanatics.
Shocking?
 just wait
Charlie go back to bed and the back bench.
Just focusing on the headline here. Mr. Flanagan doesn’t know what he’s talking about, or that we know he’s spouting absolute rubbish. We know that the Gardai are not in control. If the top security guys of the UK and France are not in control, then neither are we. Don’t patronise us.
 You’re right on Mr Flanagan (no relation of mine – thank goodness!). He seems to have forgotten the threat of Al Qaeda attacking our good ol’ Republic of Ireland because of Shannon Airport facilitating U.S. planes for refuelling on stopovers.http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/paris-terror-attacks-ireland-named-4953503
 you’ll have to educate me on Ireland’s Muslim terrorist problem. Racking my brain here but i just don’t remember any Muslim’s attacking us.
I wrote a comment here with more than 700 likes and seamus wall responded, see in the thread; about my direct day to day experience living in Germany. The journal deleted this comment the cowards. In the comment I gave my direct experience living in Germany; in the second largest city,  I said that MUSLIM young men do not integrate to Europe and they harass German women I dare anyone to challenge me on this. Especially a loser editor in the journal  …the journal censored the comment because it was the truth ….MUSLIM REFUGEES in Germany are wrecking the cities and the people have had enough. The journal couldn’t investigate anything for themselves. .glad I deleted the trash app. People need to wake up big time as to what your tax is funding
Flanagan is talking complete bollox as usual. The Gardai and anyone else are not in control of the situation, nobody is.Due to Shatter closing Templemore to save money there is a shortage of Gardai and will continue to  be undermannedFir the forseeable future. I always think when the government say that everything is kosher, that is the time to head for the hills!
  factually incorrect and logically fallacious. Nice combination.
will the sf leader in the north condemn these attacks on london while attending a ira volunteers commemorating like she did after Manchester.
 Stop trying to use the atrocities in the UK to gain political capital here. Isis have already murdered Irish people, they are a common enemy of us all.
 not making any capital atall just pointing out the hypocrisy of Michelle condemning a bomb attack on Manchester (which was not as big as the one(s) the provos exploded) while commemorating the east Tyrone brigade who where the deadliest of all units .
 terrorists murdering irish people is not a road a provo sympathizer should be going down
Where’s our intelligence service? You can’t leave this up to the guards, they’ll spill their tea
When Goats lie down with lions.Lions will eat the Goats.
Hard to believe we have this idiot in charge of our country with this going on.
 not to worry Dermot, we have the empty vessel, the sound bite, taking over soon.
 thankfully, Ireland is not directly affected and highly unlikely to be affected.
 you must have not seen  RTE Primetime on Thursday about  islamic extremists operating in  the 26 county state over recent years. ..
Try get some perspective on this guys. We have not had a terror attack yet. Last year 600 people died from suicide and 250 from road deaths.  These are far greater threats to our people than the possibility of a terror attack. Many here use terror to vent their racist/islamophobic views. The same people hated travellers before they targeted Muslims. Most muslims are peace loving people.
 Paul, suicidal thoughts and traffic accidents don’t form networks and plan out their strategy. Think about it man, come on. There’s a massive difference and we need to tackle this.
 Get real, you Islamic troll/Muslim apologist…Islam is NOT a religion of peace as you claim. Muslims want nothing to do with people of other  “inferior” religions and they have no desire to integrating into mainstream culture. They only care about introducing Sharia Law here and in other European countries. They view liberals, LBGTQs & independent women as lesser humans, not worthy of living in their eyes.
 As I said “Many here use terror to vent their racist/islamophobic views” I was referring to hate preachers like yourself John.
Brexit is the problem in England.
 Go back to bed
Brexit is the SOLUTION.
 You need to do a bit more reading on terrorism in the world in fact there are many Catholic terrorist groups
I think they need to concentrate more here in Ireland on the gangland criminals. The recent find of explosives that could blow up a street or more.
Nah.
The slave religion
Confidence and Gardai mentioned  in the one sentence and approvment by Mr.Flanagan will no doubt reasure everyone in Ireland that all is hunky dory on the corrupt little island.
So the May witches dip in the polls has nothing to do with this? Elite can’t allow Jez to take the helm so expect more of this…
Thank god for including the Arianne grande tweet, I was just wondering what she made of those event’s
The Gardai aren’t fully in control of themselves as evidenced in the antics of late. There’s no way they’re in control of terrorism opportunities in Ireland.
Statements such as that you attribute to the Minister for Foreign Affairs really need moderation as they throw down the gauntlet to organisations like Daesh and the “lone gunman” type of terrorist now coming centre-stage.
In the latest atrocity attack no knives were used, no explosives were used and a van was used. The attack was quickly contained and the three terrorists rightly and decisively killed within 8 minutes.  All in all, that is a situation under control.  It was frightening and horrific for those who were victims and saw what happened but it does not justify an immoderate and extremist reaction.ISIS wants to the UK polarise and to exacerbate tensions between the majority and the moderate Muslims.  Each of us should ask ourselves if we want to fulfill the agenda of ISIS.
 Please stop cranking out so-called “facts” here as no-one cares on what you view/comment on the latest actrocity committed in London last night. Don’t you realise that you come being close to being a patronising tw*t out of yourself?
 They did use knives, you stain.
 Out of all the nonsense peddled in this comment section, I often find yours the most irritating. You are completely delusional and out of touch with reality. You should really take heed of the thumb ratio that your comments on this issue receive. That’s not to say that journal thumbs are always correct, but if I posted something and regularly got the response that you usually get, I would take a step back and reconsider my position.
It is in the nature of Irish people to overreact. We lack composure. We are excitable  and alarmist.We respond to the Jihadist agenda.
Paris , Berlin , Manchester , Stockholm , Nice , Brussels etc etc are we ” overreacting ” to those attacks ? , rapes , sexual assaults , riots in Paris , Muslims over represented in Jails throughout the major European Countries , high unemployment , lack of assimilation , forced marriages , honour killings the list is endless and then we will have demands for Sharia Law oh happy days
Speak for yourself, old man; we know you’re a terrorist/Muslim sympathizer ;D
 that shows that you are not thinking.ISIS and Jihadism are hoping for an over reaction. In a real sense you are playning to the terrorist agenda whilst I oppose it. .
 The only opposing you’ve been doing is opposing any action being taken to sort out the problem of Islamic fundamentalism .Who gives a rats about isis , they are just one group in the bigger picture , and that picture is now showing at cinemas across Europe , the main star is islam and the director is Saudi Arabia .
 Irish terrorists are so superior to Islamic terrorists
Yes Charlie shut your cake hole and don’t be egging these nut jobs on
Charlie Flanagan pit stop ass thiking Ireland is not a target, and Garda there too busy covering Noreen behind to even protect our citizens.   Ireland is a target, maybe not in top 10 but we still allow American troops land. Wake up dead beat ministers stop playing Russian roulette with Irish People
Yeah high,erve the FCA on standby
anyone that helps the yanks will get it, im wondering what is shannon runway used for or is that old school
 Do you apologize when the Westboro Baptist Church pickets a funeral or when the IRA do an attack?
Where or when the species will strike next is not known all that is known isThat unlike animals who kill to eat these just kill.National boundaries are open and so we are all targets to the ideology of Death
We’re fcked so!
Like it or not there is blood on our hands while the yanks continue to use shannon
Ha ha Flanagan is delusional as the gardai don’t have a clue and he knows that
Why unlikely, but we don’t sell weapons to anyone??? Unlikely is not the same word as never?
 Shannon airport?

Theresa May was Home Secetary for 6 Years and done nothing about the Islamisation of England.

Who would listen to a leader of a Country that has just been ousted….
 A very respected man overseas. As is President Obama who has also left office.
 building up his contacts for the after dinner speech circuit at our expense
 kenny is only respected by the few top guys in the shambolic FG party and nobody else. The eu people don’t respect him, they like him for giving them money and use him for favours.
 Didn’t Obama ignore shaking hands with him once in front of the cameras?
That’s us fooked so!
I’d say the same people that are moaning  about Enda going on a trade mission think the economy recovered all on its own .
 What has been the benefit of this recovery to the ordinary citizens of this country? Why are so many people not happy with this government? Did you ever stop and think about this James! Could it be that the recovery is only helping the few and not the majority? If this is the case then what do you expect people to think
 Is that what you call junkets now. Here was I thinking Enda was milking it before he sits on the back benches .
 James there is no recovery in the EU. This government would have you believe that crap but Europe is falling further and further behind every day. Kenny looked after all his pals and the foreigners he sold us out to. Nothing will ever change in Ireland. Run for the elite in crowd.
 exactly and as we have a debt of billions we won’t be recovered for many years despite the BS spouted by the Fine Gael’ers
Who’s he meeting…
The trough is ever giving.. Forever at the teat…
 Yeah, he should sit on his arse at home so as not to offend the perpetually offended.
Promoting tax haven status and a leprechaun economy!
 Secret trade deals to create the new USAEU?
Two day Trip lol it takes two days to get there, you might run out on time
Another holiday lol.
kenny trying to get the yanks over for a fleecing!
He is meeting up with the Bilderbergs
 Why is his hand as big as his face then???
Say hello to al
The things people do for Chicago style pizza!
He be better off staying there
He is gone to play Roxie Hart and Merkel is playing Mary Sunshine lol.
With all this hype and campaigning you would swear the general public had a say in who we want to lead our country…
 We do whoever gets it will be leading the blue shirts into the next general election. Hopefully its not Leo the hatemonger Vradker.#anyonebutleo
 he doesn’t hate welfare cheats, he just seeks to stop them stealing from everyone else. Taxpayers might support that as a reasonable position to take.
  I agree with the catching of Welfare cheats but Leos campaign is about spreading hate. Giving people permission to stick their noses in to private affairs of others as opposed to leaving it to the trained social workers who understand the full complexity of individual situations. It may increase the numbers of people caught but it gives a licence to all to invade our neighbors business. It is a campaign of hate pure and simple in my opinion and I am not alone in that opinion as we have seen by the response to the campaign.Personally I believe the reason Leo ran the campaign was to up his advertising spend before running for leader of the party.   With a spend that big on advertising how is any editor going to run anything other then a fluff piece like above on the man.#anyonebutleo
 stealing from social welfare is not a ‘private affair’ it is criminal theft.The Irish system is already one of the most generous in the world. Double or triple-dipping needs to be rooted out.
  I agree 100 per cent alpha on social welfare fraud being theft but I don’t believe in this case the means justifies the end.  The campaign looks for people to invade their neighbors business and form opinions on their lifestyles. In some cases it will be successful in catching criminals but there will be a massive amount of collateral damage to individuals who have committed no crime.  A lot of people on social welfare have mental health/health issues which only a trained social worker might be aware of.Similar to his time in time in Health were he cut funding to Mental Health services. As said by me and many others Alpha it is a hate campaign and in my opinion ran purely to curry favor with the media.To me it is designed to spread hate and distrust in to communities. The only logic I can think behind it is that Leo needed to push up his advertising spend with the editors of all the daily before the contest for leadership began.#anyonebutleo
 Mortgage contracts are a fraud. Are illegal according to EU law.Contravene consumer protection law. The selling on of mortgages have none of the required protections in them. Banks are engage in wholesale mortgage fraud, which has resulted in hundreds, if no more, families loosing their homes, some people have committed suicide. There is also huge fraud regarding the insurance taken out to protect the mortgage.The government knows, the banks know.What’s being done about that fraud that costs ordinary people millions every year?
 its not how irish politics work. You elect your representitive who in turn votes for the leader. Irish people have voted fg, therefore giving them the power to decide
 How about they go after the cheats that ripped off the Taxpayer such as the Bankers, vulture funds and the like. Leo goes after the ordinary person as he knows these are the people they may actually catch. I don’t believe anyone should cheat but be fair we have people walking out of court free of the theft of this Country. And not only that he is trying to get thy neighbour to spy on you sound like something Trump or Hitler would do. Plus he is trying to be the leader of the Country too with out one vote from the public to do so, just brilliant that all we need a dictator
 our 1st openly gay dictator at that! Bit OTT, don’t you think?
 nope not OTT – I have no problem with a persons preference and being a voted in leader of this country – I would have issues with Leo’s policies, he’s only interested the Super Rich
 people definitively did not vote for fine gael
Whoever gets it, it will be neoliberalism, first, foremost and last. Joe public will still be mere cash cows for the rich, taxed to the max, the destruction of society will continue.
 Cheer up now. There maybe something positive going on in the world somewhere. Also, you’re being bitterly pessimistic with the whole ‘destruction of society’ thing – go and watch something funny on the TV and cheer the hell up.
 Two words, the second is “OFF”.
 Of course it is. And a good morning to you too.
 Shout a bit louder Dave – its hard to hear you all the way over there in Bulgaria.
 And good morning to you too!!
 Give’s a chance, it’s still early, but the sun is shining, skies are blue, i’ve tempered the chocolate, filled the molds, let them crystalise, now in the fridge to detatch, life’s good!!
 Do you ever think rather than cribbing and crying all the time maybe you should strive to join the “elite rich”. The only problem with you joining them is that unless you win the lotto you actually going to have work your ass off to do so. My suspicion is that your actually allergic to hard work.
 You snide generalities show you don’t have the first clue about life for ordinary people. Just like Kenny, Varadkar, Coveney, etc.
 LOL. Your good for a laugh anyway. Did you ever try stand up comedy. The only think I have in common with Kenny, Varadkar, and coveney is that I work for a living. You should try it every now and again.
 How unique. Do you want a medal?
 No I’d be happier if layabout like yourself contributed to the country in a positive manner rather than constant negativity. And you know what after a while you’ll feel better in yourself too.
 I couldn’t give two flying ones what you assume about me personally. Now go chew your nails or find something useful to do.
 makes no difference who gets it, each as self-serving as the other.
 i second that comment!
Leo Veradker will be S superb leader of FG and bad for Ireland.Veradker is heartless, very right of centre, no social conscience, a denier of the link between poverty as a factor in bad health, he has a strong and instinctive dislike of the lower income classes and an austerity approach to economics.Veradker dislikes the perceuved softness of the Social Protection system and is strong opposed to the role of Social Protection and  progressive taxation in privudying a mild counter balancing effect against extreme inequality.It’s all about neo-liberalism, the free market as a solution to everything, non-intervention in the housing crisis with public funding and a monetarist view of economics.Leo will ensure the protection of wealth and privilege. He is an Irish Tory.Leo represents the current values of FG. He loathes the old social justice policies of Garret Fitzgerald. Pure undiluted and hard line capitalism for Leo.He is the grandson of Margaret Thatcher and the son of Tony Blair.
 no intervention in housing? Plenty of intervention, but designed to overheat and increase prices and costs
 Wow you seem to know so much about Leo….except how to spell his name.Just think how many other things you’ve gotten wrong about him.
 the best social conscience is one that is committed to allowing people make their own choices without interference by the state and to keep the rewards of their enterprise and hard work.
 Very accurate appraisal.
Good bloke, intelligent etc, but a vote for Leo means paying twice for water.
  A vote for Leo will take the country down a horrific road he is the most destructive leader this country will have ever seen. No mention of his sinister time in the US or the hundreds of millions he has spent on advertising on every brief he has has since becoming a minister. I would say he has spent more on advertising then any minister in the states history. The medias darling for a reason.Hopefully FG will not inflict Leo and his ambitions to tear the country apart -If FG bring out this monster then hopefully FF will pull the plug and we can vote.#anyonebutleo
 I reckon Leo will pull the plug, catch FF on the hop, aim to solidify support in an election, then let the destruction begin!
 A committed neoliberal globalist.
 As in the American machine has helped him climb the greasy pole of Irish politics so quickly?#anyonebutleo
 ” the hundreds of millions he has spent on advertising ” – can you expand on that please
 As in his guiding political dogma.
 In every brief he has held he has ran a massive advertising campaign with a huge spend#wildatlanticway#anyonebutleo
 god help us all !
 wildatlanticway should never have been advertised. It’s a neoliberal capitalist cycling tour of the impoverished west coast for the bilderberg elite to gawp at the millions of starving Irish peasants, lying prone on the roadside, crippled and scarred with agonising austerity.There, I finished your idiotic rant for you.
  I thought it was a  great campaign and a good use of public funds – A lot of business’s I am involved with have seen an increase in profits thanks to the campaign and had been looking for something like it for years.Are you a fan of Leo  Alpha ? you are really sticking up for him these days?#anyonebutleo
 ” hundreds of millions  ” ?
  I am prone to exaggeration….apologies but I would love to see the actual spend since taking office,
 you’re making me like him more and more… He seems to be terrifying all the right people.
The Sinn Fein supporters here must be anxious and confused about a leadership contest that is openly contested.
 all the pieces of paper with gerry’s name on it are put into a balaclava by the army council and one is selected at random. The process is beyond reproach.
 what the f.. has SF got to do with it troll?
 QED Gus.
 lol @ the chip on your shoulder over SF. Im not really a SF voter but ive become so disillusioned with FF and FG pandering to bankers and european’s desires im steadily moving more and more towards SF
Leo or Simon are at least a new generation of politician. Simon was hugely effective as Minister of Agriculture. Always on top of his brief and brought in good policies to encourage young farmers into the business. His current housing role is being portrayed as a failure but you can’t change a broken planning/financing  system overnight.
 Coveney has deliberately made decisions and introduced new measures to further increase prices in an already overheating property market. The only thing that helped cool the market were the central bank measures which Coveney challenged at every opportunity and when that failed he introduced new policy and tax measure deliberately designed to circumvent the central bank rules.
  a new generation of rothschild puppets doesnt make a difference since finne gael and fianna fail are controlled opposition  Vladimir Lenin said The best way to control the opposition is to lead it ourselves
Have not seen the journal lose the run of themselves like this since pat kenny move to news talk.leo the darling boy of the Irish media vs Simon bilderberg corporation coveney,nothing will change in Irish politics with these two goons
I wonder will Leo be launching a more wide ranging general tax cheat campaign if he becomes taoiseach? Or would the wrong people be getting investigated with such a strategy? ie: friends of FG. Maybe it’s just easier to target the less well off. But all tax cheats cheat us all don’t they, regardless of being rich or poor.
Can a tax haven nation run a tax cheat campaign?
The issue is whether the Irish public will realise that political parties are about self-promotion and self-survival.  It’s no use saying politician should be this and should do that.  Politicians care about getting elected and getting re-elected and getting into governement and getting ministries and then getting to be Taoiseach and then staying Taoiseach.  Policy is determined by lobbying.  It is the Irish public that has the ultimate responsibility to determine what our politics is and how our politicians behave.  At present there is no evidence that politicians need to be concerned about the public acting together to make it clear that none of the scandals and none of the compromised policies and non of the damage and harm to citizens will be allowed to go on.  Each of us has the right and responsibility to really think about what is going on and what needs to be done differently by us.  What is happening in this country is just not acceptable.
Well said David all the plaudits they are all giving Kenny yet they knew if he had stayed on fg would face meltdown in the next ge (still might) its all just a game to them and to hell with peoples lives.
How can they let a guy who, being a doctor,who knew the state of the HSE and when “in charge” couldnt do that job suddenly be a contender to be “in charge” of of the party thats “in charge” of the country? Are FG serious or still as delusional as ever?
what a steaming heap of blatantly bias promotional fluff piece muck this is. where’s the bit about him being a proven liar and a failed minister?  The man is a self serving snake. “22 months is a relatively short time as a minister”…any reason why?  “a persons sexual orientation does not impact upon their ability to do their job BUT…” ahhhh so you are saying it does really matter and it’s a solid reason to have him as leader. Coveney is not much better by the way, ticks most of the boxes in what I’ve said about Leo.
The banks aren’t getting another cent .Mmmm , which spoofer and  bare faced liar said that .Oh wait …. good man Leo.
Is there no end to the conveyor belt feeding Ireland with awful “leaders”… they all have two things in common:1 They are very rich2 They have no interest in tightening the rich/poor divide which is pulling our society apart, with people feeling more and more disenfranchised.
Another drop in standards for the country.
 Too many drops and IW will be out in force lol.
Good article. I think Varadkar seems like the better option. Coveney has been a career politician manipulating his way to this opportunity in my opinion. Not that a I’m overly informed though it has to be said. Good luck to whoever gets in.
 has he ever actually done anything, though, apart from talking about everyone else’s job?
 the reality is they are two freemason rothschild approved central bank endorsed  crooks pretending to oppose each other
 evidence is?…….
 it explains why the goverment is so F$%kd up
This piece is advertising !
  Paid for by points earned spending the DSP budget ! You don’t think the campaign to catch social welfare cheats was actually about that.There is not an editor in the land can run an impartial piece on Leo after all he has spent since becoming a minister#anyonebutleo
 Yes Brian, Ive found all your conspiratorial comments on Leo balanced, fair and concluded in a gently ambiguous way. #hypocrite #brokenrecord #hashtag
  Take them chains off and question your masters, fool
At least he speaks his mind. Could possibly be more of an honest politician then, maybe.
 “honest” and the word “politician”  in the same sentence? Please explain?
I mean what has he ever done apart from coming out? Nothing but a big mouth.
 Seetec might disagree?
I’ve mixed feelings about Leo. I think he’ll be a positive re social liberalisation and  our backward stance on church, abortion, drugs etc. His right-wing Tory stance on economics will be damaging to society long term though.
Looking forward to fresh FG leadership.Changing out the old guard right across the aged jaded talent-impoverished Irish political spectrum can only be a good thing.Micheal Martin and Mary Lou are far beyond their sell-by date.
 fine gael are foreign owned crooks that serve the satanic elite (((1 percent)) banker terrorists owning the central banks
A failed minister twice over becomes taoiseach.irish politics.
From the establishment parties we get bosses. Never real genuine leaders.
 Ireland does not have a single REAL leader and thats the problem we exchange different gormless muppets every few years but nobody of any significance. A failure can rise to the top in Ireland…Cowan, Kenny for example..
Looks like Leo is the medias favorite as he’s getting 90 % of the press and tv coverage. Poor auld Simon. Looks like an accountant. Think that’s the issue.
The one definite I am certain of is Vardaker is a political sprinter and when the gradient is not downhill Leo will opt out like he did in health.Coveney is the real winner as he is perfectly positioned too in a short time exact sweet revenge on the power hungry ministerial so called colleagues who backed the winner this time. When you see fitzgerald side by side with Leo a perfect statement of whats to come cover up !!cover up !!
Go Leo Go
 yes please, about time.
 leo a globalist sellout coveney another globalist  sellout theres the illusion of choice the banker elite controlling the central bank (((rothschilds )) appoint them
Brilliant news. Time we pulled this country to the right. For too long we have had crazy leftist polices wasting tax payers money. I think he will be our most able Taoiseach ever
 Kevin are you sure your first name isn t Frank?
Great a gay taoiseach wtf he will be useless at world affairs as most are anti gay well done tds and ministers make sure you get your pay rises and job adjustments
Blah, blah, blah! Considering the poor quality of our politicians, who cares where he was born, educated, whatever!
Love the Leo
Membership score element of Electoral College, noted above, should read 35:65 not 65:35.The Leo didn’t win all three, similar to The Donald’s experience in greatest Democracy in the world last November.If 25% = 20,000, how can 75% = <500 ?The 10,000 or so folks from the Membership, who actually voted in this contest, must be feeling a tad miffed this morning that their voices counted for so little in arriving at the final outcome.The process seems a bit outdated and redolent of a bygone era.
Does it not depend on how good their ministry is and was? Both now seem to be the ministry of sound lol.
There’s a guy in Pettigo-that’s in Donegal-who gives a fukk about this but no one else does.
fair play hope he does a better Job for the  future of republic of Ireland. Respect
New santa clas ask for your wishes now. the amount of media on him now not a easy job jesus
ah! he won fair and square, with a little help from the media, we will do the autopsy in two years time when FG follow the PDs Labour and the Greens down the Toilet. For now , best of luck to him..
Anywhere else you’d be optimistic that new and younger blood would instigate change in Irish politics.. .and genuinely new way of thinking. Not the civil war, totally unfit for purpose style of politics we have now but a genuinely progressive way forward. But then you see the corruption in this country and you remember that both of these guys have come through the FG ranks and sadly all optimism quickly evaporates .
 The so called similarity between FF and FG has been much talked about, maybe with Leo as FG leader people will find it easier to see that Fine Gael are the party of the elite, and I suppose the elite are entitled to be represented as much as the serfs, it is a democracy after all, but at least the pretence of FG as the people’s party will be well and truly gone , so maybe it’s a good thing they do today, break out the Beaujolais ..
Yeah…except half of the FG front bench are school teachers…so very “elite”…
 What an extremely naive comment to make.
 school teachers, thats the main reason for all the incompetence. School teachers are trained to teach, not get involved in national politics with national economics, finance and business. They eff up and we all end up paying for it.
 You wouldn’t want a nurse instead of a skilled surgeon to perform major open heart surgery, yet the people who vote for these incompetent teacher come politicians, stupidly think they can run major state departments. I don’t see many private companies rushing out to grab and take advantage of martins or kennys management skills.
So, it’s either the millionaires man in the room, who thinks class warfare is a good election tactic, or the billionaires man in the room, who treats the democratic will of the people as an inconvenience to his ends.Christ, it’s like having to pick which strain of flesh eating virus you want infesting your undercarriage.
That’s Fine Gael for you. Telling the Irish middle class what they want to hear since 1933. Then taxing the fcuk out of them when the going gets tough.Has to the most boring, mundane and unremarkable leadership race since…well…their last one.
 Heres to hoping that Leo gives the middle class a break via less tax and less freebies for the #Entitled.
 Beautifully put!
 Still you have to look at the alternative and lets be clear there is only one viable alternative. FF approach is to give everybody tax cuts and to hell with regulation of banks shur well all get rich and have a great time!
 Keep your class divisions to yourself. They are not the entitled they are the rightful. People have Rights. Thats justice. It happens in a civilised society so I am sorry to express that inconvenient truth.
 “let’s be clear ” kind of an indication of your preferred alternative .
 I dont really have a preference between FF and FG but you have to accept that any government formed in Ireland has to contain one of them.
 Aaaaw poor snac is obsessed with those on social welfare and is ignoring the super rich, the vulture funds and the bankers who rob us blind many times over!
Leadership Elections provide an fantastic opportunity for the thing missing most from Irish politics – a debate on policy.Having a leadership election allows a party to sound out the views of its members on alternate focuses and directions, while at the same time provides feedback from those outside the party. Just look at the attention given to Leo’s potential policies – it is rare that a policy is ever evaluated in its own right. Far too often Irish politics is just about the name – the media rarely bother to critically evaluate what was said, and just focus on who said it.If Leo wins the election but loses the members vote, he’ll have no choice but analyse why. Most will focus on his perceived move to the right – and recommend he corrects that. The leadership election process should help to knock the “rough edges” off his persona and policies. He’ll have been given a clear message by the membership to get back to the centre.Overall, difficult to argue it has been anything other than an extremely positive process for FG. They are at their highest in the polls for years, are 9 points ahead of FF and have had a variety of potential policies vetted both internally and externally.I’d say you’ll see other parties copy this template (though not exactly – still need to deal with the problem of a lopsided early political part declarations – that needs fixing).More people will have voted in this leadership election than any other. That is a good thing. Hopefully the days of a leader being chosen in secret in a back room by unnamed figures with zero transparency are over. I sincerely doubt any party would dare ignore the membership in future.You never know, some might even grow brave enough to have a contest in the first place.
The way the Dublin media practically tried to force Covenney to step down a fortnight ago as the pushed as hard as they could to say Varadkar was a done deal. I would love to see Covenney take it and watching some of our spineless politicians do a u-turn would be mildly entertaining!
 It is going to be a wipe out. Fail to prepare, prepare to fail…
Not a fan of either..both as useless  as chocolate teapots but i’d prefer simon to get it just to put leo back in his place..he thinks hes the all singing all dancing modern irish man but his thoughts and policies are as antiquated as the party he serves . Ps was anyone else as peeved as me hearing enda kenny saying dont let the b@stards knock you down…you do know thats the irish public he qas referring to … so we are b@stards for trying to have control over the politicians that we pay to run this country… nice to see how we are perceived although not shocked
 well said
Simon Coveney should get the job.Varadker is too smug.
 Or you know, maybe they could count the votes, rather than use your personal bias?
It’s a totally worthless and irrelevant event for most people. There’ll be zero change. Just one dishonest corrupt individual replacing another.
And yes folks, it’s the Leo and Simon show or the Simon and Leo show.Fed up with real politics and real  social issues. Then enjoy the the unspeakable and the unsayable clash for your entertainment.Forget about homelessness, destitution, social exclusion, malfunctioing health and justice, just  indulge yourselves in the personality competition.
Either way we are at a loss
Well, whom ever gets to run the Blueshirts, don’t expect change for the better… Most likely new taxes a good bet within what’s left of this farce of a government. Meole will pull the plug shortly..
 Meole will do nothing. Hes a gutless politician and his sole interest Is the leader’s salary and expenses to build a “little” nest egg, hes just seeing out his time now and then the golden handshake and six figure pension and he’ll be off too!!
In Ireland we pay high personal taxes and get very little in return…..Leo might do something about this and media portray him as some sort of  right wing politician….His tax policy is well to the left of Jeremy Corbyn….Does not even plan to get rid of the USC
 Actually there is a large cohort who pay very little taxes but get a huge amount of freebies. They are the #Entitled.We have the highest social welfare in europe irespective of what you earned in the past. Even in Sweden, which the left often reference, they pay social welfare relative to the tax you paid in the past.
 Someone earning 30k pays about 15% in all direct income taxes and scocial insurance. That’s hardly draconian. The problem starts at 34k when you lose almost half of anything you earn above that amont. That needs to change.
They could have elected a pope quicker.
Wow a new leader for FG? I’m so excited not……
Statement of the week: It is highly likely either Varadkar or Coveney will become Taoiseach!!!
The tension is very bearable.
Hopefully whoever wins will be open to working with parties and independents  who want  stability and progress on critical issues. Some smaller parties will continue there negative approach but they are best ignored as the majority of Irish people will when it comes to the next election.
 Don’t worry the cosy little arrangement your party FF have as false opposition to FG will continue. The coalition of the snakes in Irish politics is what it’s all about . Whose turn at the trough next ? Two cheeks of the same ar#e.
 You don’t really like democracy I take it. Anyway you guys keep shouting from the sidelines while FF lead the opposition in this country.
Just passed gov buildings and tried to picture the rainbow flag fluttering where the tricolour is
The comments section of this website has become a depressing place. Its clear that the “go-getters” are clearly out hustling and making money. The rest are on here. Anyway, off I go. Need to pay for my 3rd holiday this year.
Larry Fitzwell make it a long holiday
“TDs aren’t the only ones who decide however, with MEPs, senators, some 235 councillors and 21,000 party members eligible to cast a ballot”What about the rest of us taxpayers? we have no say in this… jebus wept
Would it not be strange to have the leaders of FF & FG from the one county? Has that ever happened before?
 Garrett and Charlie, although Charlie I think was a Mayo by birth and adopted Kerryman.
Leo is a handsome, flamboyant gay man, darling of the media and D4 set, the son of an immigrant.He will do well, the country may not.
A Bilderberger running our country. The Rothschild’s will be pleased.
A Bilderberger running our country, the Rothschild’s will be pleased.
Ah, I see the Boys in the Bland is playing again. I wonder what the soundtrack is like this time around? Cohen’s “Old ceremony, new skin” maybe……
New lapdog for merkel u mean
Won’t be watching/listening to any RTE, TV3 broadcasts for the next few days. Will the sun rise on Monday …. I think so
It be a bad new start unless FF get good budget social welfare & min wage increases. FF pull the plug now or secure proper budget increases for the least well off or FF, you will get what Labour got
Here we have a crisis in Garda Corruption, a housing crisis and hospital services meltdown year on year.. and whats the media interested in – a beauty pageant between two political parasites.
They never asked them their favourite Beyonce song.
Leo is right about his favourite animal the Aardvark-a very sneaky individual who hunts in the dark-He kind of looks like him too.
 he will need to change his first name to Pinocchio, there is some nose on that animal!!!
 similar type snout alright.
Never trust a person who takes pineapple on their pizza or eats their eggs runny.
…because we’ll have seduced your wife! Go team pineapple/runny eggs!
Who really cares? Andrex or Kittensoft? All going down the toilet anyway.
Searching questions,that reveal a lot about all Parties ,Don’t become “Journal Lite”
 White or Brown… Envelope lol.
Well this article is utter shite.
 or a bit of fun! Lighten up!
 Fun, maybe. Definitely not funny or insightful though. Rubbish questions.
Simon cant love animals that much if he supports chasing them with dogs with the hope of catching them and ripping them apart!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SEDI-fYX3YTwo snakes who will carry on where Enda left off. Lets hope the trend of the main parties losing public support continues and we might eventually get someone to run the country with the best interests of the people at heart.
Manhatten Cheese & Onion beats them all
these are the really important character defining questions… by this I’d be leaning covney!
Rónán means little seal, but I’m not a complete narcissist so seals are not my favourite animal.That said, the pineapple on pizza thing is very important to me so I’d have to choose Leo over Simon.
Very sad reflection for Ireland that these type of childish questions were being used when we were looking to elect a LEADER for the country
pineapple on pizza is an abomination before God and Man. Anchovies, capers and olives is the way to go.
Being a Taoiseach and a mushroom are similar, they are both Fungis to be around lol.
Jog on Kenny, I’m sure there’s plenty of regrets regarding electing you
 Presided over the the biggest waiting and trolley crises in the history of the state. Presided over the biggest evistion rate and homeless figures since the great famine. those are just a few of his legacies and he says he has no regrets. Typical delusional blueshirt.
 and on €150,000 pension that we are paying for willy
 who would you have had as ladder,,,
 it’s time to try something new and not the same old FG FF crap over and over again. People are afraid of what they don’t know
 Well not the 42 year do nothing TD  that’s for sure. Someone with backbone, puts the Irish people first before and above the interests of the vultures who Kenny allowed to strip Irish assets bare.Definitely not to be found in FG.
 he inherited a failed FF economy led by Aherne and Cowen both who ran away from the electorate
 And made it worse.
All these issues would be 10x worse were it not for EK’s firm leadership.In a field of populists we were lucky to have a solid man at the helm.Hopefully the new blood is of similar principled mettle.
@noel, don’t forget the near €400K golden handshake. I assume it’s tax free, probably even USC exempt.
 I have wished they would bring the red button back, but reading your assessment of Kenny I propose they bring back the red and add a ‘laughing till I cry’ button as well
Delighted to see the back of him. One of the worst leaders the country has ever had.
He was no leader, a caretaker perhaps…being generous.
 How old are you?
Enda Kenny’s legacy is to leave behind a country more corrupt than when he became Taoiseach. He done a fine job for his masters.
 he’s just allowed it be revealed. It was even more corrupt in the past. Thank Kenny for allowing the light to shine.
You let us down Kenny. No time for you what so ever.. Can’t see that changing with Leo or Simon…
Nolite te Bast.ardes carborundorum.How very Roman Emperor of him, although I suppose it’s fair to say no-one could ever accuse Enda of having a low opinion of himself….
I presume he is referring to himself as “THE B*ST*RD “.
 I think he means us, the whinging citizens. To him we’re just numbers in an election announcement.
Coming from the biggest b*stard of them all! NB: The Journal.ie rejected the B word stating it was offence, buy yet they’ve used it? So it’s ok for them to use it but not the commentators?
Only Kenny the emperor can use it it seems..
Few people outside his constituency in Mayo will be sorry to see him go from the Irish political scene. The height of arrogance to say he has no regrets! Jaysus man show a bit of humility.
Act in the interests of the bast*rds who get you down??
 Ah sure they’re all whingers…. ;-)
 as this forum will attest ad nauseum
Interesting turn of phrase, as not actually Latin, but the closest literal Latin translation is “not fit to grind down the outlaws”, which I guess could paraphrase his time in office.
$poof€r, I hope he joins Bertie in the allotments and they grow a few more magic mushrooms, he’s been taking them for years!!! Spaced out of it living in a dream land, Goodluck
Any Political leader who loses 35%  of his party’s seats in one election should be shot, not praised…
Ha! My comment wasn’t allowed because I repeated the B-word in the headline!
Good riddance.
Enda should have loads of regrets. How he treated the people of Ireland. As for his latin advice who did he aim that at his party or the people of Ireland. He will be no loss just another politican that feathered his nest.
Elder statesman at last bows out ,with advice on how to deal with the electorate
On almost 200.000 a year and half that in expenses, I’d gladly take the sh!t the Bast*rds threw my way………
Good riddance ya horrible b@stard
The only bas&€rd in this country is you Kenny!
 Really? Just the one?
Legend
 Bellend a
 A man who took instruction well from Merkel and that will in part be his legacy to many?
Kettle/pot
So Kenny can say the B word here but we the people can’t. Why is the the B word not allowed here. Are we that much afraid of free speech in 2017.
I don’t think enda done a bad job. After all look at what he was left with from them filth Fianna Fáil
Nice to see what he really thinks of those of us burdened with keeping him extremely comfortable for the rest of his life. Disgusting.
yes mr kenny paddy wants to know, now we know what you think of the people who bailed this country out, all the promises new politics , sack ministers who are not up to it, corruption is rive in this country, just look at the guarda management a minster who along with her commissioner who should have been sack but know they will get a big pay and pension like yourself mr kenny, maybe answer your phone oh a job with the EU. well i for one will be glad to see the last you! thanks for nothing!!
Note to everybody in the country.Don’t let these b@$tard politicians get you down!
Transparent and new politics my hole. Good riddance to you enda.
Well it you know what they say it takes one to know one
Opposition my hole.It’s truly an old boys club, where the interests of the country are only a side show.
Finally, let’s hope he doesn’t pull anymore delays.
Don’t let the door hit you in the back on the way out hopefully full of rusty 6″ nails with manure on them you traitor Ethna Kenny Cromwell
He’s the biggest b@st@rd of them all!!!
In Fairness to Kenny – He is Responsible for Fine Gael and Fianna Fail coming together to seize Power since the Last General Election.Confidence and Supply Agreement.Ingenious Avoidance of Coalition Tag.Cute WhoorismUnique Irish Solution to Irish ProblemIt’s the Way He Smiles Cunningly and uses his hands and fingers.We Always Have Michael Wring to Fall Back on….Another Genius
 A coup?
Is that what he thinks of the democratic process now?
ass
Good, and I hope I never lay eyes on the lying, treacherous (unt again.I hope he enjoys his 30 pieces of silver knowing the suffering and hardship he heaped on the Irish taxpayer
Enda Kenny not answering direct questions, why change a habit of a lifetime?
Kenny never answered a question covered up for 6 yrs in government.
oh! wait til we hear the back stabbers make em-passionate speeches about how he served his people well.  vomit ,  bucket come to mind…
I’m just thinking back to the final ‘Peanuts’ comic strip where Charlie Brown finally got to kick the football, and was wondering if kenny will finally answer a question he’s asked.Here’s hopin’…..
What legacy?
Kenny wasn’t the worst of them, considering others who our knowledgeable electorate voted in. Like Haughey, Cowan, Ahern, Burke, Flynn etc.
Fank Pulman. He is up there with the worst of them.
 Rubbish m8. As bad as Haughey who we elected time after time, knowing his impossible lifestyle and propensity to be bribed¡¿
 What happened to Paul Foot and Pendragon 917. Can’t figure out which was the worst of them.
 Twitter account now permanently suspended! Congratulations you pillock…
@Fank Pulman , Now how was that when I replied to Paul Foot your account pops up. Naughty, have you not got enough confidence in yourself, whichever that is, that you have to have multiple accounts. Or are you always so stupid, or is today a special occasion .
 Lewd behaviour got you the permanent ban from Twitter – and I’m stupid? What does that make you?…o/
 Who am I answering now , you or Paul Foot , You have so many identity’s It’s hard to keep up. Troll on Wank or Paul whichever suits at the time. Low self esteem is usually associated with people of your type
Clare, as usual,is bang on right !
The minister for everything is getting found out,the Irish media have been rather quiet about the leadership race the last day or two after there darling boy Leo seems to be letting his lead slip a bit.hopefully leo the Tory blows it because his bad for the common people of this country
 the tory … What about bilderberg SimonTwo of them are the same . More of the same
The reason the Irish Media are being quiet is cos nobody cares about fake contest
 Irish Times story from 2014 using @CampaignforLeo twitter handle.Journal – think you should amend the article to include the fact that he has been publicly been using the slogan for 6 years at least.In fairness, it works for all elections – not just leadership contests.
Here’s the link –https://liveblog.irishtimes.com/fe040e921b/Cabinet-Reshuffle/
 Fair play Journal – can see the article says this now.
Leo is a bull$hitter if he expects us to believe that.By the way, an Irish Independent poll yesterday had the public backing Coveney 64% to Varadkar 36%.The politicians are not listening to the people.
 Irish independent poll.     Yep …..
 it’s not scientific but I wouldn’t think it’s too far off the Mark.Leo is Brexit.He has the numbers but it’s not reflective of public opinion.FG need to be careful not to foist him on a public who don’t want him.
 Story is demonstrably false.Here’s a tweet from President Higgins from 2012 using //twitter.com/presidentirl/status/830890837559083010
Apologies to all – my link above was to a tweet from 2017, not 2012. My mistake.Here’s  one quoted in the Irish Times from 2014 though –https://liveblog.irishtimes.com/fe040e921b/Cabinet-Reshuffle/
As quoted in article ” fail to prepare, prepare to fail”.  Simons campaign was holed beneath the waterline before it got going. Bleating about his opponents preparedness  sounds like sour grapes.
 in fairness he had a day job as well thought Leo does have to comment on other minister portfolio. Look let’s be honest here, Leo has been prepped for a long time and the TD backing him ramped as soon as the bandwagon took off even before Leo vision was published. Lack of backbone in that party has cost the whole country dearly.
His twitter handle has been @campaignforLeo since December 2010.He’s clearly been using the slogan for years.This is really scraping the bottom of the barrel.
 Leo the lip.Engages his mouth before consulting his brain.
 someone should tell Leo that it was Benjamin Franklin who said that  long time before Roy.
Leo is fond of the porkies.
Well this story doesn’t stack up.Here’s a tweet from President Higgins from 2012 using //twitter.com/presidentirl/status/830890837559083010
 Tweet is from Feb 12th 2017, not Feb 2012
 he might have been using the slogan but he’s formed the website in preparation for the leadership campaign. That’s the point.
 Whoops – you are absolutely right Ciaran – my mistake.Here’s one from 2014 – as quoted in the Irish Times –Here’s the link –https://liveblog.irishtimes.com/fe040e921b/Cabinet-Reshuffle/
 Zero evidence for that though, Tom.If your major social presence is on Twitter, it makes sense to align the other media with that.@campaignforleo works for all elections, not just leadership contests.
 His people told TheJournal.ie that the creation of the domain was part of a move to create consistency across Varadkar’s online presence. Go on will ya … it’s not the preparing that’s annoying, it’s the porkies.
2 gobs hites
“It’s me verses Dublin” and now the “Prepare to Fail” negatives show Coveney’s camp as a bunch of choirboys singing out of tune.
public is not going to get who they want , just like Joan Burton taking the Crown from Gilmore, it will just speed up their demise….
Enough of these 2 prcks already
Pinocchio to replace Pinocchio.
A bit of a non-story.  Enda made it clear in February that he was going “soon”.  It would be more surprising if any who considered themselves as potential successors did not begin preparations “months ago”.
A choice a rich boy from Dublin or a rich boy from Cork. Both cut from the same cloth. Leo is loved by the media because he had an opinion on everything. Not exactly leadership material. A general election would tell a lot.
What an utterly ludicrous non-story. So Leo actually prepared for the leadership campaign and his opponent is irked! If you want a job badly enough aren’t you expected to prepare? This goes beyond sour grapes and looks like sheer naivety. Simon thought he had it in the bag.I would rather a person as Taoiseach who is prepared and who likes to win than someone who simply complains about someone who is prepared and has a hissy fit when things don’t go their away. In any event two Corkmen as leaders of our main political parties is one too many. They have a big enough chip on their shoulder as is.
Hardly newsworthy
Leo is Brexit.He has the numbers but it’s not what the public majority want.The public prefer Coveney 64 to 36%
Huh?I think Brexit is a terrible idea, but to say it isn’t wasn’t what the public wanted is ridiculous, given they had a referendum on it and 52% voted for it.
 it’s not ridiculous.Think about it.The Irish independent poll has the public favouring Coveney 64 to 36
Link to this poll, please?
 Also, I’d say FF and SF supporters would far prefer Coveney.Varadkar scares them.
 don’t give me that.Look it up. It got very big coverage.Look at the Indo news page. Google it.Use your imagination.Anybody else here verify this poll?The Irish times poll also verify Coveny is preferred.
I saw the Irish Times one, Tom. It was close – 42% to 37% among FG and 48/44 among non FG.Have gone looking for the Indo one you quoted but can’t find it anywhere.I did google it, as you suggested, and I can’t find it anywhere.So again – link please?
I don’t quite get why Leo is the popular candidate in FG. He’s alright, a politician who announced the move of a maternity hospital to his own constituency to co-locate with an adult hospital that does not have the specialties, facilities and expertise that makes the co-location worthy, but I guess that’s politics.It’s really more of the same.
NEWSFLASH!!! Nobody cares about the outcome of this sham fight by two second raters for an extra pension to be purloined from the public purse! The result of which has already being decided by the FG grandees who see it as an opportunity to disseminate their lies and raise the profiles of these two dullards! Simon has already being bequeath the position, the coronation will go ahead as scheduled! Leo is probably lucky to be slipping in the race, if he had an unassailable lead I feel pretty certain some issues would arise requiring him to withdraw! Let’s have a real election! Roll on #GE2017
Politician sets up website. I’m failing to see the story here. There’s plenty of actual reasons to criticise Leo. This isn’t one.
Good to hear The Journal’s media studies interns have figured out how to use the Whois register. Expect more sensational revelations before this well runs dry.
Talking about the important things as usual.
I see a storm brewing too lol.
Good god .. there’s no end to the lies in this country ..
 what lies?
 Leo beats Martin every day of the week, we need a good leader. Plus who can forget the IW flip-flopping by FF! Shameful, childish and unhelpful.
 Your’s
 You look very different without the beard James
 switch accounts there again shinnerbot
 why did your parents name you ‘just’ shinnertroll?
 liberal alert? FF got us into the mess and FG got us out of it. More prosperous then we have ever been
 lies are when cortupt fine gael and fianna fail spread false information
clearly everyone feels better about fine gael because kenny is gone, and noonan is gone, more or less. it won’t last but if simon softlad harris, francis feeblemind fitzgerald and some mitchell yoke were to go, FG might even look like a decent partner. be a damn sight better than a bunch of half-brained independents in ministerial position. farmer gael couldn’t even muster the number to look crap on their own after the last election.
 except for the evidence based facts you quite obviously don’t want to hear
 Prosperous? Are you well in the head? Honestly the people of Ireland truly baffle me at times (regularly)!!!
 ah SF. You lot are the worst of the worst. You will never ever get a vote. Go near my door with your cheaply done  sympathy leaflets and il run you. You have the worst temperament of any european political parties. Your a embarrassment to this c
I’m no supporter of Coveney but what in your opinion qualifies Leo for the job or as you’ve put it “Leo beats Martin every day of the week”, I’m just curious to where the basis of your opinion comes from? Not trying to be argumentative just curious.
Apologies correction I should have said “I’m no supporter of Martin” in this conversation. A side note, I’m also not supporter of Leo or Coveney, in fact I’d nearly go as far as saying I’m no fan of any of the corrupt ilk ruining this country
 It is worse than lies, it is bullsh…t.
Same circus different clowns……doesn’t matter which of the two is in government. The wealthy will still live in a consequence free country and the ordinary worker will get squeezed for every last cent.
 Have a look on YouTube for Mouseland. Sums up politics in this country perfect
 Your not far off with that one. We are all good little mice!
Spot on, Just look at the events of the last few weeks/months, and come the next election it will more of the same. In fact there’s no party that has the best interests of the entire nation.
 Some of them start off in politics with good intentions but as soon as they get on the gravy train, its goodbye morals.
Fair point
 it’s FF that got us into this mess not FG. And while FG had some hipcups along the way I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. And a vote for Simon is a vote for the common people of Ireland, unlike Leo who is a elitist snob who will  care of the wealthy. Leo does not understand the working class system. He is a doctor afterall.
Theres only one truly accurate way to guage the moid of the voter, and it can’t come soon enough.FF should have pulled the plug on water charges beford FG swapped leader. Serious error.
 Agreed. They could well have missed the boat.If they fall 5 or 6 points behind, they won’t want to be seen to be the ones to pull the plug, either.Could leave Varadkar in a strong position.Hopefully he does something with it. An extra 5,000 social houses would be a start.
 Unlike you I’ve never been banned. I don’t use twitter. Abusing people, is that what you call pulling you up on lies. Your next account name should be Billy Liar.
 we seen the vile underbelly of the SF/IRA trolls this week. truly truly harrowing
I would expect a general election within the next 12 months especially if we see a “Leo bounce” in the polls. FG could be heading towards 35% especially as the economy continues to do very well.
Bounce is to be expected, given the increased coverage and no surprise that Kenny’s approval is highest after he announces his leaving.Varadkar’s first response to the last election result was that he expected FG to be in opposition, so I don’t think he’s afraid of an election.If he sustains the bounce, it will really put FF in a difficult position. He can push ahead with items that are borderline/outside the Prog for Gov, and dare FF to pull the plug and call an election no one wants, with them behind in the polls.He’s far too cute to call one himself.
 they could teach the Mafia a lot!
 Surprising comment there James. There is no way FG will receive 40% of seats at a general election – 25% is much more realistic. Homelessness getting worse / a laughable excuse for a police force / employment rising primarily because of zero hour contracts …. and this week’s shambolic collapse of the Fitzpatrick trial etc etc. Varadkar is a far-right, gaffe prone fraud and he’ll be found out quick enough (assuming he wins) as the incompetent he is.
 Oh yeah, like the Burton bounce, I see how that works.
votes are not the same as seats. 40% of the vote in a GE would possibly allow FG to govern alone with a majority.
 just to be clear, as I appreciate there can be a divergence between % of vote and % of seats due to our PRO system. FG will receive no more than 25% of seats and no more than 20% of the vote . They will be extremely transfer unfriendly, almost toxic in fact. They will not receive any level of transfers from FF, SF and the other left wing parties/alliances (Labour are a centrist party so they are not included).
PR system
No more than 20% of the vote, even though they’re polling 30% even before Leo is elected? You’re sure about that?
 yes Fred I’m sure about that, certain in fact.
 “FG will receive…no more than 20% of the vote”PP would give you very, very, very, very long odds on that.For a reason.Think there might be some wishful thinking there, John.
 Both FF and FG’s % of the votes in the last GE barely made the 40% mark. The share of votes they have received in GEs since 1983 have been in steady decline.Given the scandals the government lurch from week in week out they will be lucky if they suffer what Lab suffered.There’s a scandal in Cavan CC being kept quite by the media. It will be interesting to see who’s the beneficiaries of that.Another huge scandal is desperately being kept under wraps, goes back 10 yrs, is ongoing, and involves state agencies. When that breaks, it will be the end .
 FF plus FG made 49.9%, Dave. And that excludes Renua and gene pool independents who came from FF and FG. Reports of their demise have been greatly exaggerated.
 I did read it  barely made 43% combined votes. Doesn’t matter the decline will continue.Varadkar will make Noonan look like a pussy cat.
 I hope not.If Coveney wins the “popular vote” with the membership by any margin, it will be a pretty clear message to Varadkar to modify his message and soften the harder edges to any policy he may wish to implement.
fantastic news, all the hard work is paying off :)
 goes to show what people thought of kenny pity he retired….
 Is that you BH ?Stick to the day job – good man
 endas legacy is secure, the man who saved ireland :)
 the judiciary is independent shinnerbot, you are going to have to take your rage elsewhere. A shinner talking about truth? absolutey hilarious, and you wonder why we laugh and laugh and laugh
 And ren morons support that comment or are you just deleting the cookies?
 well they cant be delivered by storks now can they shinnerbot?
 and you wonder why no one takes you clowns seriously
 What work, the civil servants do all the work?
Only in Ireland could you get 12% more popular simply for announcing your gonna finally f off
Fg media propaganda is always being their best and only policy in government.
 saving ireland was the policy and boy did they succeed, its no wonder they are the people choice
 75% don’t want them.
 87% dont want your lot, why do you think that is? morally bankrupt perhaps?
 But, But, But, Stutter, Stutter, Stutter, Whataboutery is no answer. Enjoy your time sitting beside Labor trying to get speaking time that no one wants to listen to.
 13%, would you consider that a success? PMSL
 The Red C Poll said they would vote the Seanad out of existence, remember that?
Yes an election would be good idea get rid of this Dail unable to make any decisions….We will have a chorus from independents and SF in media saying election will change nothing….Not so sure about that…. Less independents will be elected next time….
 there are oly two parties, everything else is a spoiled vote
 why they only make a mess of things when they are allowed to make decisions
 I don’t think you took your memory meds this morning, Sf have been constantly calling for an election.
 I disagree. The independents have brought a lot of balance. No guillotine in use this term.
If FG are foolish enough to think a momentary bounce because of all the coverage is going to do them any good during the intensity of a GE campaign they deserve to lose.
 Luke 4:24http://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-05-25/assigning-credit-for-the-irish-economic-miracle
How can anyone be daft enough to keep voting in the same parties who trashed this country? Are you all sadomasochists or what?
 FG saved the country
Because they believe hard left policies would be worse.We need something new in the centre  in this country.
 How about the “honest” party? There’s a big gap in the market for that.
Unfortunately a “honest” political party is only a pipe dream at the moment.” Everyone knows FF/FG/ Lab don’t keep there promises, but most people are afraid SF/ Solidarity etc might try keep theirs”
One word for this country : #Doomed
How any true Irish man or women could vote for any of the three main party’s ff fg lab is be on me look at what they are doing and have done to the country people need to wake up these shower are only in it for themselves and there friends just ask seanie the Irish are blind
And they will shoot themselves in the foot again by electing varadkar as leader.
I despair of this country.
Fianna Fail are losing ground because of their ambiguous posturing on the Garda Commissioner business. They’re supporting a Government that supports her, while they DON’T.    What self-respecting voter could get their head around that sort of doublethink?
Public are begging for a GE to fumigate Leinster house from FF,fg, labour.
 then we would be left with SF/IRA and Solidarity the Left behind alternative. We would become the new Venezuela.
What’s the point in political parties? Only idiots take them seriously. Dictated to (and bankrolled) by the banks, supported by the press and voted in by flag-waving surrender monkeys. Go on, get excited about nothing.
Increase is down to that pillock kenny finally taking the hint & leaving
To the Taoiseach for people who get up early in the morning, Leo Varadkar I say this.There are people packing shelves in supermarkets at night, security guards, cabin crew working for airlines, getting up at 3 am (a lot earlier than you Leo) to go and work on zero hour contracts.Please don’t be so patronising Leo.
Coveney any day ahead of Varadkar.FG jumped the gun endorsing Varadkar without listening to what the people want.If you think this country is right wing now, you ain’t seen nothing yet.What has Varadkar achieved in any department he has been in?
I think their incompetence over Seany getting off will come back and bite them.
 nothing to do with FG, judiciary is independent
 How can the ‘judiciary be independent’ when Fine Gael are appointing the judges ???????
Yep.. Gotta be true ☺Will Yee fu(k up with the shite …Wind of change upsetting all. Together these 2 will score worse again … Mehole knows this and hence the farce continues ..
I wonder how many of these people polled were finegael supporters & what had kenny done to get high satisfaction rating
What porportion of irish citizens read the Times?The headline is Absolute nonsense.
 The poll was partly funded by the Irish Times, not limited to Irish Times readers.
Vardakar is probably the closest thing we have in this country that’s close to a Macron. Huge bounce coming Fine Gael’s way.
 Yeah remember the last one, the Burton bounce. Remind me again how that worked out.
I wonder how many of these people polled were finegael supporters & what had kenny done to get high satisfaction rating
In the race to the bottom.
 Who’s bottom lol.
Leo was 9 when GFA was signed and so grew up in peaceful times. So I don’t expect the were you in the Ira response when asked a question by Adams. That will be a good first measure of Leo ability to lead
 Was Gerry Adams in the IRA???
 The only thing jorry has left to deny is that he is jorry LOL
 That’s easy to deny halfwit, his name is Gerry.
James connolly. How is the driving school going Dane??
 of course that is a well known fact. Democratic law would go out the door if he were elected god forbid. SF are good at giving out but they are all talk no action. One SF councillor promised my community lots of inprov
If this poll is representative of what will happen at the next general election then the Irish people deserve to be treated with contempt by the ruling class. Why should our so called elected representatives have any respect for us when we let them walk all over us time and time again. They must think we are stupid, pathetic fools and are therefore treating us accordingly.
Ff fg 2 cheeks same ass .. same lies same deceit nothing has been achieved by these to corrupt parties . Robbing the country blind in the name of austerity.. homelessness up hospital s in crisis Garda scandal banksters scandal selling off everything Irish . Fg appointed judge in Sean Fitzpatrick trial jury manipulation. Set up to fail before it started . Drumms case will be the same . Not 1 person held responsible for banking scam .. only the people of Ireland robbed by a governance dictatorship that’s corrupt thru an thru ..
Irish independent poll for next Taoiseach has Coveney preferred by 64% and Varadkar on 36%.FG need to listen to the people.Politicians need to swallow their pride and switch allegiance or the public will punish them.
Ah I just thought mayve it was a poll taken during a FFG rally!! Otherwise I cannot fathom the stupidity and especially with Shinners as FF lite
Meehole martin has missed the boat with his arrangement to keep his salary coming in and keeping his cushy position in the dail, he thought he could wait for 2 years for his position in polls along with the corrupt liebour to improve , but now if varadkar (a phony) gets in he will be a distant runner up for a long time.
FG shouldn’t lose the run of themselves. Between Neva Enda’s long goodbye and leadership race, the spotlight has been on them since Feb. If FF TDs didn’t turn up for work for the past three months, nobody would have noticed. Least of all the ADHD media
F*#king morons is all that comes into my mind. Really is the sheeple mentality
How are FF still in existence! Mind boggles
Once again, commentators endlessly criticising and complaining. Question: what sort of Ireland would you actually like to see? People can do and say what they want, but the reality is politics was and is thus, a dirty business – not just in Ireland, everywhere.
Just shows the  amount of stupid idiots there are are in Ireland. Look at the two idiots who will leading this country soon.  Its just a well Merkel tells them what to do.
So Enda leaves and their popularity goes up???
The ambulance service, the hospitals could not cope. They are running daily at 100% . If there was a large attack or disaster in the country we would not be able to cope.
 If a good plan is put is place and rehearsed, we might have a chance. Plan for possible attacks at Croke Park, Aviva, 3arena, racecourses etc. We’d have to use coastguard and Air Corp helicopters (maybe legislate for secondment of equipment/crews from NI), and basically throw people out of A&E to make space. Our infrastructure is what it is unfortunately, so it’s incredibly important that the state prepares for the worst.
I would think there are emergency plans in place at Dublin, Cork and Limerick/Ennis hospitals in case of a major emergency at one of the airports so I would think it would be only a matter of extending that plan to cover possible terrorism attack.Where I think we are ill prepared is the security to 1. Prevent and 2. react to such an attack.These teams should be meeting 3/4 times a year and not just as a reaction to events like Manchester.
 correct the reason soo many people died in the Dublin Monaghan bombings was because the country is totally unprepared to deal with the aftermath of a terrorist attack . The reality is your more likely to survive a terrorist attack  in another country . Many people died in Dublin Monaghan bombings because doctors where completely inexperience in dealing with bomb blast victims .  If the same attack happen north of the border your chances of surviving would be greatly increased .
 The reason people died in the Dublin, Monaghan bombings , was on account of the lax security. I was caught up in the attack, thankfully not seriously injured, the Doctors. nurses, medics on the day were true hero’s as were the people in the vicinity who dug for and carried the dead and injured. The   gardai under the direction of the FG government of the day only had one objective, the putting down of the Republican’s and turned a blind eye to loyalist terror.
 If there were to be a big disaster the likelihood is it will be a plane crash, rail crash, chemical explosion etc. You can’t go about your life wondering what will fall from the shy next. Keeping the Yanks out of Shannon would be the best protection from a miniscule terrorist attack in Ireland. Tell them to take their bombs and missiles somewhere else.
 Jst to inform you , along with your recommendations, we actually don’t have any nursing staff and a shortage of senior medical staff so maybe we should get planes ready to evacuate to England !
 id say you were on the grassy knoll also shinnerbot… #clown
 How would they get past all the trollies choking the corridors.
 3/4 times a year? FFS! Minimally, weekly meetings are required, with ongoing contact daily with reviews and updates as each change arises. The price of our freedom is perpetual vigilance. Rational action, taken in time and maintained on high alert.
 I’d say if you were there the smell of your sh#it would have required gas masks. And spinal injuries would’nt have been a concern, you have’nt got one.
 No, It’s just you Diarmuid, all your posts are porkies.
They’ll probably debate it in the dail, set up a committee, wait for the report on the committee’s findings, pay themselves extra for appearing the committee, should have solid guidelines on how to move forward on this in about 5 years time. Only problem is the terrorists ain’t gonna wait till the Irish gov are prepared.
 it would make you laugh if it was not so serious!!They can’t organise a bed for a homeless family never mind take on an Isis threat
 they should get the homeless to fight isis. Now that’s problem solving.
 so new iodine tablets in the post then…
 Mickey mouse would run this kip better.
Several things need to be done. Apart from the security risk to the general public we are going to have first responders going in when everyone else is trying to get away from an incident. How can we expect our paramedics firefighters Gardai and army to go into a situation that there is no planning or specific training for ?  Also why on earth don’t we have a separate intelligence agency ? Ireland will fast become operational headquarters of extremist activity in Europe  if we don’t properly resource our agencies. That’s if it’s not already happening and the real reason we haven’t had a terrorism incident here. Low profiles and no spotlights being shone only ” monitoring ” . We need to get our country up to speed and we need to do it now !!!!
 ‘Ireland will fast become operational headquarters for extremist activity in Europe’ . . . some top notch hysteria there.
 Hysteria ??? Ok. Please take all your inside knowledge on the subject to the police and the media so. I’m sure they would appreciate it. It we have under resourced agencies dealing with international terrorism we ARE going to have more fund raising groups and other activities going on here. We had fighters here who returned from Syria. Our government ” monitored ” them. The UK put them on trial. Please don’t tell me we aren’t an easy target for people wanting to go undected.
  A separate intelligence agency ? which in all possibility would end up spending all its resources/funding investigating corrupt politicians and dodgey dealings among Noreen’s band of Merry men.
 So Catherine you have gone from ‘operational headquarters’ to ‘fundraising groups’. Maybe its you who should be sharing all this inside knowledge you have. You will need to get your story straight first though.
 There is a major emergency plan for every county in Ireland. In Dublin less than 6 months ago Dublin fire brigade hosted a multi agency major emergency exercise which consisted of a terrorist attack on a concert. The national ambulance service, garda, army and DFB all took part. The major emergency plan involves freeing up E.D departments of non emergency patients in the event of a large scale incident. This also involves a cross border co-operation aspect if required. Please god we will never have to use it but we would not be lacking in our response.
 trust me ireland is a soft touch and is a major transit point and we have numerous sympathisers and recruiters living here FREELY
Don’t believe the hype and give up all our freedoms cause of a few extremistsTerrorism is at its lowest level since the 1970′s !https://qz.com/558597/charted-terror-attacks-in-western-europe-from-the-1970s-to-now/
Is these islamofacists want to target us it will impossible to stop the reality is we don’t know them , some of these” Indian ” restaurants are like clearing houses with people constantly coming and  going . Imam Noonan in Galway has raised concerns about extremists among Muslims here not that you would know from the compliant media
The threat is already in Ireland ‘ recent arrests by Garda in relation to terror activities have been as a direct tip off from UK US & European Security’so forget about the Garda having intelligenceIreland will be targeted and its only a matter of time before this happens’ if terror factions can kill Children do you think they are about Ireland and it’s neutralityEurope needs to work as a Union and close all Borders’ restrict movements of persons of interest ‘ attach Militarily to European police forces to flush out and eliminate any threats that exist.We need to be looking at Banking movements too as these move money around all the time and don’t use main stream banking but transfer bankingAnyone associated with terror should be prosecuted to the highest achievable punishments
 If they do target us I hope its where the real terrorists are Dail Eireann.
Will be the shortest meeting of the year no doubt.. ah but sure not to worry another meeting will be along shortly in the year dot.
We’ll be grand!The homeless administered first aid in Manchester and most of our large towns have plenty of those!On a serious note we are anything but prepared.
We should have a stand alone intelligence service, nobody has any faith in the Garda.
 yes your right, riddled with corruption and thugs in uniform
 Untrue! The Tánaiste does and so does the Garda Commissioner. So you’re wrong, completely wrong, there are at least two who believe in the Garda Síochána. There may be others.

Do our defence forces have their own ambulances that could be put to use in an emergency? Even a small number would make a huge difference in the initial few hours.
 yes several
 6 4×4 ambulances and a handful of regular ambulances stationed around the country.
 sure Fianna Gael would love to abolish the defence forces.
Start by throwing out all those in hospital due to self abuse, that should make plenty of space.
 People making comments like this should be banned. You are targeting vulnerable people like Varadkar. What kind of sick people are Fianna Gael.
 I reported your comment and i hope the Journal does something because I was banned for less.
Garda figures released state that  over half a million terror attacks were foiled in 2015.
“Minister Fitzgerald – Dublin City is under attack, what’s the response?”‘I’ll be in Dail Eireann first thing in the morning to set up a committee to look into the unfolding crisis’
 But the politicians wouldnt care. They would be protected. It is ordinary people who would die. Lets face it the people get hurt politicians hide.
A dedicated Intelligence Agency on the same lines as MI5 would be a beginning. Placing the burden of State Security Intelligence gathering on an already over stretched Garda Service is going to lead to something being missed. We are the only country in Europe that doesn’t have a Separate Internal Security Agency running in parallel to the Police.
 Get the healy Raes in. That should sort it.
I’m guessing that’s a short meeting
Army ranger wing wud handle the situation as good as any others, they may be short in numbers but lack nothing else for the job
 always wondered why we didnt use them to crush the evil provos
 Once again I wish you would do some research into your topic , the army rangers were set up as a military unit which would be able to secure towns and roads into the north to help in the evacuation of the catholic/nationalist community .A ranger unit operates in behind enemy lines to secure objectives and help in evacuations . The Irish military got the idea from a WW2 operation in the Phillipines , the raid on Cabanatuan . But like most organisations in a poorly funded army , have had to adapt to needs .https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raid_at_Cabanatuan
 The troll that is presentlyJames Connoly is just one of many aliases he uses. He’s not the brightest in fact he’s depriving some village of an idiot. But the good news is, he’s usually banned fairly quickly.
 I recognize his style of words , I think he was all over the George graffiti story . I still enjoy having a pop at him though .
 Wouldn’t bother with him, Ken. Obviously a complete weirdo.
Lets just kick everyone out that doesn’t have a bloodline since before say the Vikings arrived.
All these resources having to be set up. What a massive cost.
can you imagine it. A fella in a shed with a computer with windows 95 connected to a web cam watching a field,
Sergeant Mikey Murphy from Westmeath with his big ears beer belly and red face is the man to stop them
we are rangersjolly jolly rangers
Government agencies meet today to assess Ireland’s preparations against f̶a̶l̶s̶e̶ ̶f̶l̶a̶g̶  terrorism
Wafflers
I’d say we’d just about get a poet organised afterwards !
I have zero faith in our emergency public services including the gardai
Hospitals are full to bursting, ambulances dropping off sick people waiting in a queue. So NO we won’t cope when there is a terrorist attack here. It not a question of if but when.
2.5 million people live in Greater Manchester Area, and they managed ti scramble 60 ambulances to deal with the incident last week. How many could we muster for Dublin? My guess is its not 60. In Cork or Waterford – possibly 8 to 10 if they pool resources. In Limerick or Galway probably the same. There isn’t even a plan here for any one of the Emergency Services, not to mention a co-ordinated response. Emergency workers would do their best, and risk their own lives to run towards the scene – but then have to wait for years for the “root and branch” review to identify the shortfalls – without blaming anyone obviously for lacking the foresight to even have a plan. Scary how unprepared we are.
Radicalisation is a weapon of mass destruction triggered by remote. We must find a way to neutralise it.Let me share this, in case anything I have experienced or learned is of any use to anyone in finding a real way to prevent and/or reverse radicalisation.https://exiledweb.wordpress.com/2017/05/25/i-think-someone-tried-to-radicalise-me/I am updating whenever anything relevant occurs to me.I am contactable through twitter, facebook, or the blog.
They wouldn’t know what’s Ireland and where to find it
Open borders and the government forced redistribution of people will result in endless cultural conflict in the form of terror.  There is not many examples in history counter to this.Ethnically homogeneous countries have little problem with terror – multiculturalism is the greatest lie perpetrated on western peoples in recent years.
 Have you nothing better to do than troll around these comment sections? Saw a few your posts today and honestly, you come across as a complete loser. Get a life.
Burn it burn it all.
Same sex marriage doesn’t put bread on the table of the poor.
Low unemployment rates do though. I’m not necessarily a FG supporter but no one can deny that there has be an impressive reduction in unemployment rates
 The gig economy pay & conditions. Oh that 10c increase in min wage really puts bread on the table.
 think the poor are better treated in other developed countries??
Either way the same sex marriage referendum was driven by the Labour Party and Eamonn Gilmore in particular. I can’t see how Kenny, a professed social conservative can claim any credit for the initiative.
 or that FG followed the FF plan (they in fairness had already carried out the heavy lifting) and the Troika plan. Things got dark and murky after the Troika left.
 Labour broke EVERY economic promise. Remember the tesco ad? Eamon Gilmore & Pat Rabbitte are the two biggest champagne socialists ever on their early massive multiple pensions. They quit politics as they knew Labour were toast in election 2016 but featured their nest & retirement payments while in office. Remember Gilmores wife made killing from selling inherited land to state for a school & also Gilmore gave her plush hundreds of thousands of euros paid job while Tanaiste. These two were all anti bin water & home taxes in 2011(they broke promises in 3 yrs) & had billions to waste on Irish Water while thousands become homeless & medical cards were taken off the most ill children. They stood over hospital waiting lists growing by thousands a month too. Some socialists
 “think the poor are better treated in other developed countries??”Yes. In the nordics, they are guaranteed affordable housing, free world class healthcare and free third level education, not to mention free childcare to get them back on their feet and into the workforce.Let me know if there’s anything else you need to be enlightened on.
 Said “goodbye” to the troika? What does that mean? Nothing. We’re still paying the ransom for the international banking swindle which FG were delighted to offer up with our taxes. F*ked is too nice a term for it. Idiots vote and mostly the smart have to pay.
@Tweety McTweeterAnd an impressive  reduction in pay rates for workers.
easily our greatest ever leader, a true hero to all irish people. the usual begrudgers are livid. the shinnerbots are just going to have to suck it up LOL
 how are the poor treated in northern ireland under your beloved SF/IRA. highest child poverty in europe in west belfast all thanks to SF/IRA
 They’re just figures, unfortunately
 you having a laugh? Think you can go on dole over there for life or refuse to pay water, sewage or bin charges?Compare like with like will you and enlighten youself before you offer to enlighten others from a keyboard warrior profile.
 Dumbo of the thousand names, you should have posted under your Endathegreat nom de plume, thats alias to you Dumbo.Did your mammy give you her phone to play with again after she changed your nappy.
 anything to contribute shinnerbot? LOL
 Your fondness for the word ‘free’ is everything that’s wrong with this country right now.
 that extra 10c on min wage certainly does put bread on the table. Say, for example, you have someone on min wage working 40 hours a week. That’s 4euro extra PER WEEK. That’s 208euro extra in his pocket every year. I buy a loaf in the corner shop for 2euro, that’s 104 loafs of bread. That’s a lot of bread
Don’t fool yourself.  Someone is paying.
 some of that may be the case but it’s all dependent on a successful economy. The world doesn’t owe, you, I or the Irish state a living.
 you mean the nordic countries who pay a level of tax that would cause a revolution in this country if Introduced?  We want top class services in this country but we don’t want to pay for them. Look what happened with water.
 dont baffle the shinnerbot with facts they dont like that it hurts their little brains :D
 A 214% increase in child homelessness is what’s wrong with the country. It’s even worse reading multiple account FG fraperoom shills lauding Kenny for such an acheivement.
 Factor in the mass emigration, low wage, zero hour Contracts, typical fg work profile
 326% increase in child poverty in northern ireland under SF/IRA, the multiple account holding shinnerbots are desperate to cover up such facts
 Hi booby. Just to let you know I’m sitting here with a pint in front of me having a good chuckle at the thoughts of you wasting your Saturday night on your little SF/IRA/shinnerbot obsession.Please continueCHEERS!
 they are actually. Lower grade jobs pay much higher wages in Holland and Germany the 2 most successful economies in the Eu. Inequality is much less there than in Ireland.
 Norway has oil-enough said-nationalized under statoil. Sweden has the metals industry….and was not involved in ww2 after they made a deal with Adolf Hitler to provide steel for German War Machine.
The nordics are the exception rather than the rule.Let me know if there’s anything else you need to be enlightened on.
FG history, but proper Irish history will show what he really was, a mere puppet to his European masters and the enabler of tax avoidance for the rich and corporate sections of society.
Kenny was a political construct.Between Brussels dictating economic policy and a coterie of highly paid consultants orchestrating the spin I doubt we’ll ever get a glimpse into the mind of the real Enda Kenny.The question of whether there was ever anything worthwhile there will be left hanging in the air for all eternity.Strikes me as a guy who got lucky twice, first through inheriting his father’s seat then through Fine Gael gaining electoral victory by default.If I was to write his epitaph it would be:‘I did what I was told’
 he will get a standing ovation at the game tomorrow, fully deserved for the man who saved ireland :)
 He gave away and sold any assets Ireland had, to feather the nest’s and fill the trough with gravy for his rich friends.And all supported by idiots such as yourself.
 you have yourself all worked up shinnerbot. what did he give away exactly? what did he sell exactly? what rich friends did he help and what proof do you have?spoofer much shinnerbot? PMSL
 I’d say there’s a stronger chances of him getting booed, that’s if they even bother to notice him!
 it would be hard to miss our greatest ever citizen. a true hero  and patriot :)
 i doubt that the man who destroyed Irish society will get anything but the abuse he deserves.
 bertie has had plenty of abuse, mostly deserved, on that we agree. thankfully enda came along and save the country, we are truly blessed to have such a fantastic leader and patriot. never has someone deserved their pension pot more than enda. i shall send him a bottle of exquisite champagne as a thank you.
 deluded fool if you think that, guess you must be a paid FG troll,
 troll
 man who said yes Angela all the way . He didn’t Save us we saved ourselves we paid high price high austerity measures sold our country to vultures which in turn has created massive crisis in rental sector. Useless spineless gutless man
Personally ,,,, he had it in his grasp to be one of the best leaders,,, the country was in  a state after FF ,, it was there to be fixed ,,, but he bowed to Europe and the Richest in the land ,,,,,
 What would you have done?
 well considering I met the man I would have first done what we personally asked him to do,,,,, what’s more I voted FG and feel extremely let down ,,
 Perfectly put Elaine
So what exactly did you ask him to do?
Like him or not, its a job we can all criticise and say do this, he did it fair PLAY you can’t leave earth unjudged .
Those waiting years in pain for an operation beg to differ as to the thousands homeless & counting.
 the 94% of people with jobs would beg to differ too I suppose yes?
 Those paying our staggering debt and the hordes who had to emigrate would ask you to get real I suppose, Yes?
 the 79,000 immigrants to Ireland last year, who believe that the Irish economy is good enough to move here would beg to differ I suppose yes?
 he is and has always been completely out of touch with the Irish people. How can you say fair play to him? He’s an embarrassment. And now we pay his pension for 20 odd years. The people lose again… but hey, lets elect another tosser with no connection to the issues, like we always do.
Who created the debt?
Nah … one of the most mediocre leaders we’ve ever had. The journal reporters now speaking for FG?
 oh yeah cos any random politician would be able to do the extraordinary work that Enda did. Sure bring in oul Luke Ming as taoisheach for the craic sure
 Not logical that the entire front bench of FG (except f harris) went “all out” for Varadkar” . why?
History will state he served himself and his party well.His legacy is a shameful one.
 His lump sum & pension is waiting for his greedy self after hogging on to pass longest days a FG member was taoiseach
 he is the greatest ever irish person, the man who saved ireland
 Who the F let you out of the mental home .Oh! I get it. Every time there is an Enda article or an opportunity to slag SF, They give you a phone to play with, Halfwit.
 you have yourself all worked up shinnerbot it is rather amusing
 troll, dont feed the toll
 Same as every other party leader. Has there been a politician of note in this country who didn’t serve themselves first, their party second and the country third?
In 50 years time every YouTube video will document this man cowardly attempt at being a leader. From running over female journalists to non handshakes with Obama. History will be cold in its judgement of FG’s first re-elected leader who could not even face Vincent Browne once.His political reform stopped at having more women like Humphries, Fitzgerald at the cabinet table. same spoofers just a different sex (ish)Universal health care, O’reilly brainchild since 2009 which flopped while all involved will never be held to account.Independent planning enquiry, Phil Hogan stopped this immediately FG entered government with labour. opting for dept of environment whitewash instead. Kenny protected FG councillors who took bribes from developers to rezone land. these FG councillors now pick our new leader and the same developers are given state contracts because the know how “construction inflation” works and with foreign bank account to deposit the bag of sterling.He was at best a default Taoiseach who ran away for much of his time in office. At worst he kept cronyism at the heart of Irish politics. he mislead the dail on numerous occasions and never answered a direct question.Maybe his legacy will be he managed to leave office with more pensions then brain cells. hopefully his like will never be seen again.
 his place as our greatest ever leader is secure, the begrudgers are just going to have to suck it up
 troll troll troll troll troll troll troll troll troll troll troll troll troll troll troll troll troll troll
The string puppet controlled by his European masters. A spineless inept coward who always popped up at any minor success but was nowhere to be seen for all his many shortcomings. Himself and Noonan, the worst finance minister the state has ever seen and most likely ever will, should be remembered as nothing but desperately poor leaders way out of their depth who fell into their roles out of extenuating circumstances when the country was in turmoil. They were fortunate to be answering to and held on a leash by their bosses in Brussels so as not to have been exposed for what they really are yet they sail off into the sunset as some kind of heroes and saviours of the state….what a country.
 have a look over at Greece where they elected a hard left party and you will see they just signed their latest bail out this week.Easy criticise. The left whingers would have done no differently in this country. When we lost our sovreignty we lost our ability to call the shots.If you really believe differently then say exactly who you wanted at the helm and what they would have done differently.
 Silly comment. It was decades of hopping from one right wing government to another, both of whom facilitated wide scale tax avoidance (sound famiiar?), that wrecked greeces economy. Syriza were responsible  for the largest and most severe economic adjustment in modern history to try bring greeces finances back to sustainability.
 you are proving my point.Syriza did exact opposite of what they said they would do if they got into govt. Just don’t get it do you??
 Revisionism doesn’t work when the events are less than a decade old james.
 you are very livid about this shinnerbot, it is rather amusing watching the shinners trying to rewrite the present also :D
 Syriza held a referendum to use it as a prop to sign off on austerity because they hadn’t even the guts to stand by their pledges to ‘take on Europe’ and resist austerity. Then when the ‘won’ the referendum they still didn’t stand by their pledges and ignored the referendum result. Unbelievable but great ginea pig which lays bare the type of pausity of the left economic policies.
 Dumbo of the thousand names go get your nappy changed you smell again and leave the conversation to the grownups.
 you have yourself all worked up shinnerbot. the reality not living up to your agenda. enda will be remembered as our greatest ever leader and you and your ilk can do nothing about it. its best to just laugh at you idiots
Give us a break from your shinnerbot rants….your sounding like a fool
 not a single fact here. All just opinion. Anybody can do that. So, Niall O D, unless you have some decent arguments for us, backed up with decent facts, just go home and play with your toes! Good Boy!
The revisionism is in praising Syriza for imposing austerity, when the reality is that it was the last thing they wanted until they got into power, had to take a reality pill, and found that (rightly or wrongly) austerity was the only option available to them.The hypocrisy is in praising Syriza for imposing austerity whilst simultaneously criticising Enda Kenny for imposing austerity.
In, what 40yrs sitting in Dail Eireann, what did he actually do. Nothing for most of those years. As Teashop, he kicked more cans,told more lies, lived in a fantasy world of his own making. Like Noonan he has no regard for ordinary people. Knows nothing and cares even less about the life they live. He has presided over the most corrupt two governments the country has ever seen. And given FF’s record that’s quite an achievement.It all depends on who’s writing the history, realists, or fantasists.
 its fun to listen to the shinnerbots trying to rewrite the present :D
 It’s more fun reading the comments from  fascists like yourself, who would rather burn money, as you said, before you seen a cent of it going to the needy.
 genuine needs no problem, useless scroungers i would gladly let starve off :)
 Pure Hitlerite fascism, but you lack the intelligence to understand it.
 you shinners know all about hitler and the nazis, SF fought side by side with the nazis its a well documented fact
Like it or loathe it Christina, kenny won’t be remembered for achieving anything. History will say ireland struggled for over a decade after this last recession with Kenny having little effect on social issues like record homelessness. Maybe their bloated state economics figures were posted to make things rosy for the history books but they’ll have leprechaun economics associated with them.
I don’t think the academics will be studying kenny-omics or noonan-omics. At least bertie will have his northern ireland peace process. There’s nothing to remember kenny for!
Hell, I don’t even think he deserves the dignity of that “official” type photo you have at the start of this article! It’s totally phoney, makes a mockery of the job.
He made a mockery of the job of taoiseach with his constant controversarys and cover ups Remember his farsical hilarious defence in the dail during the whistle blower controversary.
 talking to yourself is a sign…. :D
Oh I’m sure the history books of many a european country will be kind to merkels man on the west of the continent.For many a generation, however, enda kenny will be remembered as the man who doubled child poverty and stood by as vulture funds snapped up propertties for buttons while homelessness grew to record levels.
 how are SF doing on child poverty and homelessness in northern ireland?  how many years in government and done nothing about it, have they any shame at all?
Would somebody like to PM ‘booby’ a box of crayons?
 I would say he will be compared to that other enforcer of the Great Famine, Trevelayan, such was his legacy of child poverty and the homeless .
 no comment on child poverty in the north and homelessness, do you not care what hardship SF are imposing on those people in the north? does your concern for homelessness and child poverty stop at the border shinnerbot? have you any morals at all?
Depends on who is writing the history or how the austerity which was imposed by him impacted your life or those of your family.
Enda’s & Labour’s budgets were extremely regressive. Budget 2012-10e a week cut for the most ill & poorest next to homeless citizens(many have become homeless since then while he was taoiseach with no hope). 2e a week for a whole household(could be 2 or more weathly adults in the house & budget 2012 only took 2e off them), through the household charge while those who owned nothing had 10e worth of cuts.Leo even said “have a holiday” after budget 2012 & Labour continued to allow Enda to attack the poorest for the next 4 years. Enda & Labour showed no compassion for the disabled OAPS 99.7% genuinely unemployed & lone parents.Their legacy is highest homeless & hospital waiting lists but bondholders, Apple &every millionaire & of course billionaires(DOB especially)& vulture funds got billions
 people always talk about budgets being regressive, and “targeting the poorest” but they ignore the fact that the starting position pre crash was not sustainable; some people took heavy cuts to their SW; but also a lot of working people lost businesses, houses and were forced to emigrate. Those figures are not in the budget.
I remember Enda Kenny. He was an agent of the ECB and the European Commission who told Europe that the Irish people deserved to be punished for partying too much.
 Remind you of anyone? Trevelynn of the Great Famine, who said the famine was gods punishment on the Irish people.
 poor ould terrorist mcguinness never got such plaudits as enda, that must really hurt you and your ilk :D
 Don’t forget the next time you’re banned, you can come back with a new name that describes you,  Dumbo.
 It think it’s about time to employ the mute button on you. And i suggest a few others employ it as well.Go away to the corner with your dunces hat on.
 if you have lost the debate then go ahead and hit that button and admit defeat. loser do what losers do :D
Yeah! and so will the state coffers… how much is that pension worth…?
Enda Kenny legacy of homeless
Family’s will pass on to their children and theirs what enda,fg,and labour did to the Irish people.the truth.
History can be just a paid PR piece, these comments however are not.Here you see the truth.
 Like the news…
 Not One Red Cent to the banks. Leo Varadkar 2011:https://youtu.be/WQrhBIuSCmM
Marriage referendum,apologising to women of magdalene laundries,Vatican speech and Tuam babies were all easy political wins for him whereby anything else he said or done would not be tolerated in the society we live in today.Navigating Ireland through the bailout??All I seen FG and Labour do was implement what FF had in place which was dictated by the Troika/IMF.I will say getting the ball moving on abortion regardless of how slow it is,is a positive move as it is not an easy political win.
 kind of agree terry, heartfelt speechifying about magdalenes and tuam babies but requiring no difficult decisions or actions, or policy competence is too easily overpraised, see also st Patrick’s immigration speech. All the same, I don’t think you can say they ‘just’ implemented fianna fail policies; implementation is everything.
He’s definitely it the worst anyway
He did the state some service….Some know it….That is all….
 Was that not the German government when they did 8 budgets for us? And we took some of the German debt as well?
Guys, wake up! I wish Spain had Ireland’s unemployment rate or economic growth. I wish  my Spanish stupid politicians had had Ireland’s success in attracting multinationals, securing jobs and promoting Spain outside of some battled, dictatorial South America countries.Yes there is a serious homeless crisis here, and abortion laws are not aligned with what Irish citizens want, and yes the rent market is insane, and the health system a joke but hell, I much rather be here than in Spain with all its suffocating sunshine and flashy cafes. Why? Because on the overall Ireland offers better job prospects, decent pay and safer conditions for women in the workplace!I can’t even vote on your elections but if you ask me Enda hasn’t done a bad job handling your country!
 well said
Truly one of the worst of them all, smug arrogant, corrupt with snout firmly in the trough jobs for the boys who follow the gravy train
 any specifics re. the corruption jonny? Or is anyone you dislike/disagree with now corrupt? In fact, I don’t think I’ve ever heard any credible questions about enda’s ethics and you can’t say that about all our tds.
how should enda be honored, i think a massive statue on grafton street and rename it to enda kenny street would suffice for the man who has given so much to ireland
 How about naming a s#it house in Castlebar, the Enda Kenny House. and you could have the job of wiping the as#ses.
Wasn’t a big fan of FG or of Enda, I’m still not.  However, my respect for Enda increased dramatically when he slapped down trump in Washington DC in front of him and his cronies.  He acted like a true leader that day.
 Good point ! His immigration speech went viral and was viewed 30 million times ………. Not bad going !!
Wold easily top any poll of the most hated man in Ireland.
Yes employment rates are down but amazingly so is tax revenue!The reason is because Fine Gael have created a cheap labour pool for their wealthy friends to make massive profits off their backs.The cheap labour market that Fine Gael and Labour created is a disgrace!!
Tax revenue isn’t down
* unless you’re talking about down on the peak years of the celtic tiger.http://databank.finance.gov.ie/FinDataBank.aspx?rep=TaxYrTrend
The leader of a country that never engaged in a debate within the realms of the media or outside of the Dail.History will be short of quotes that weren’t scripted or approved by special advisors..
In that case then history’s an arse!
 I disagree Les Behan.We are now the fastest growing economy in Europe.Things are still very difficult but he has brought the country a long way.Let’s see how good Leo is.There is more to being Taoiseach than going to electric picnic and wearing coloured wrist bands.By the way.Why the new identity?
 “We are now the fastest growing economy in Europe.”As pointed out by David McWilliams, the term ‘fastest growing economy in europe’ is meaningless when it’s ireland as we are an anglo/american economy bolted on to the euro. Ignoring the fact that the bar is set so low.
 David Mc Williams has carved out a nice career, writing articles and books whilst never having to deal with the issues.Make him Minister for Finance and he would struggle like everybody else.So how well is the Greek economy doing after telling the Germans to FO?Remind me please.
 Carving out a career without dealing with the issues? How apt you use that phrase in an article about enda kenny, who has been doing that in the daiil for the last 42 years.
 Enda kicked so many cans down the street while implementing Fianna Fail policies of “recovery”. Just look at the mess he’s leaving behind. One of most corrupt countries in Europe, which got worse under his watch when he promised to introduce “new politics” to change that culture perfected by Fianna Fail.  Fine Gael under Enda’s leadership in government out did Fianna Fail in being Fianna Fail.I was banned for no reason, no explanation.
 i suppose the unemployment figures are meaningless to, as is the tax take. hows the doom and glooom propaganda going for SF/IRA PMSL
 you shouldn’t be banned.We don’t agree on too much but I respect free speech. Shame on the journo.Regarding corrupt Ireland, I agree.But don’t you think we put people on pedestals?It seems you can be one of the wealthiest men in the country, employ thousands on bogus zero hour contracts, yet the nation worship you and media wont say a bad word.We need to rethink who our heroes are.
 For all the good it did as you can see. A minor inconvenience nothing more!
i think he should be immortalized on our 2 euro coin, nothing less than he deserves
Enda and fg was so great he had to depend on their so called sworn enemy to get them back in government. That shows you what the people really think of him. If people really want to see what his legacy is then walk through the streets of any medium sized town in this country. Take note of all the homeless people & the families sleeping in cars. Once you have that done go to a hospital and have a look at the lines of sick people waiting on trollies. This is the reality of modern ireland under fg who were led by Enda. Of course parts of Ireland are recovering but it is mainly Dublin and it is sucking the life out of the rest of the country and now Dublin is at bursting point.The guy and his party promised new politics, one of many many lies they told the people.
Because it is people like him who write the history here…
Just don’t mention Dennis O’Brien and Moriarty, the lies he told about the whistle-blower the fact that he’s so inept he has took to wearing an earpiece during Dail questions.
He’ll be remembered fondly for his remarkable stories, The man with the  two pints, The army guarding the ATM’s, Saudi womens rights, The woman with money after the budget,Tthe emperors new clothes, Oh! sorry, that last one was Hans Christian Anderson, I mix Enda and Hans up so regularly. However Enda has told stories ranging from Vladimir Lenin’s visit here for Collins to imaginary conversation with Katherine Zappone, a magnificent imagination is being lost. Though I’d say he’s not averse to spinning one of his tales over a few pints or over the dinner table. Ah! they countries loss is some other eejit’s   gain.
I said it a few times here over the years that senior civil servants and political pensions need a reality check. They should have been capped at about 70k when the IMF was in, it didn’t happen. A 70k pension is still far more than most of us will ever earn a year working.
Yea, but do you have a compatible amount of responsibilities, working hours and stress in your job?Whether you agree with certain politicians or not, the Taoiseachs job is comparable to the CEO of a very large company. I don’t think the current salary and benefits for the Taoiseach are out of the way for someone with that responsibility. If you pay someone in power poorly, it only increases the risk of corruption
 The most intelligent comment you have ever posted reg I think.
 Yes the job is difficult and for that you receive a salary. A pension is for when you’re sitting at home weeding the garden. Should it be about 80% of his current salary?
 I’ve said lots of sensible things here Derek. Just because you may not agree does not make them any less sensible!
 They are all absolutely corrupt to the core anyway, its supposed to be a vocation, pay them 40k a year. If they want rk make 200+k they can just hit up Do Boy and have him award them a no-show position on one of his boards, a-la Biffo the pisshead
 So we bribe them so they won’t take bribes?? Great idea.. How about we hire people who put their country first and not themselves??
 I’m in agreement they should be well paid to stop corruption. But on the other is the threat of corruption is valid reason to “over pay” our politicians!!
I agree that it’s the same as a CEO but surely if the performance of a top CEO was on par with enda he would have been sacked years back with no pension. As usual politicians get voted in make a mess and leave with a wad of money..
 Dunno about you but I’d rather attract the very best, driven, dedicated members of society rather than just someone who’s willing to accept 40k a year to be the subject of abuse and vitirol day in day.Not a fan of Kenny in the slightest – he’s weak and aloof – but outrage about money every time a politician retires is tiresome.
 the real problem I have is that this is an unlimited liability on current expenditure for years to come. I would much prefer if they gave politicians a significant salary increase, as that will be accounted for during their “productive” years, rather than a legacy debt for a load of wealthy pensioned politicians; aswell as other senior civil servants. We dont know what the future will bring, how can we be sure we can fund all these liabilities. It just seems like basic maths to me, but maybe I don’t get it.
 Well we seem to have failed in attracting the very best with what we pay politicians already……
He is getting 3 different pension packages, TD pension, Taoiseach pension plus Ministerial pension for his time as junior minister in 80/90s and a lump sum for each…Still not massive.Bertie and Brian Cowen got bigger pensions!
 what responsibility. He had people tell him and lead him evrywhere. He was like a puppet.
 not much working hours or stress in retirement..
So you think that someone who is paid 40 k a year is not driven. So you equate money rather than the person with the job???? That ridiculous.
 Agreed.
 but would you put kenny in charge of a very large company. I don’t see many large private companies rushing out looking for teachers with their teaching skills to run their companies.
 Look at Singapore and how they pay politicians and the problem with corruption they don’t have  and the quality of politicians they get. Then I would ask you to see what you think when you see how well the economy does there.
 tiresome? So we just give up and let them have whatever they like?
 And name one company that any of them wouldn’t  bankrupt if they were made a CEO of? They are made directors of companies not because of their prowess but as a thank you for corrupt practices and access to their contacts as Biffo says going forward.Also does that money include his teachers pension which he has refused to give up?
 He got paid too much already, for the job he was doing and a pension is paid when you retire from work. Justify paying that money, for taking it easy at home and it’s for life for 6 years work.
its not half enough considering all he has done for ireland
  You do know that a CEO at a large company would be out on his ear if he displayed the type of incompetence as Kenny has.
 Tax free lump sums  and golden pensions for the economy wreckers.  Aherne was only 59 years old, Cowen 50, got ? tax free lump sums + a pension of 150,000 Euro pa.We have John Bruton, and Liam Cosgrave  and now Kenny on the golden pension gravy train, that will make 5 ex Taoiseach on the state payroll. Is there any other country on the planet that have 5 ex Prime ministers on pension’s? i doubt it.  This so called people’s Republic has a 205,000000,000, debt costing 8,000000,000 pa in interest, a sixth of all taxes collected by Revenue. All of this debt was socialized onto the back’s of the citizen’s by the spineless establishment political classes.  64 Billion of this debt was caused by greedy Banker’s, and the Galway tent developer classes,  Unsustainable State apparatus salaries, pension’s and the over paid and allowanced political classes as above and their underling’s, also was a huge contributing factor. The whole cost base from 2002 to the crash in 2007/8 was let out of control by the incompetent some corrupt cute hoor establishment political classes.  The citizens of this country are paying a high price for electing the same old useless lifers election after election to represent their interests in Dail Eireann when the evidence show’s their main interest’s are themselves families, friend’s, cronies, and fellow cute hoors.  When we ever learn after all the damage the establishment politico’s have done most of the citizen’s still decide to put them back to do more damage, and continue on with the Status Quo.
 so we pay politicians big salaries so they won’t be corrupt,well it’s not working
 The more they get the more they want, it is called GREED.
 paying people in this country more makes them more corrupt, our politicians are a classic example.
 if we keep this with enda, although it applies to every taoiseach in my memory, not one of them would have been capable of managing a chip shop, never mind being CEO of a large company.Most got there as part of a political dynasty or as a result of the school they attended.
  we have one of the most corrupt political set ups in europe and we pay our politicians far more than they are worth ! kenny will also get a substantial pension and payout from his teaching ‘job’  – one he hasnt been in for over 40 yrs yet still gets full pension rights! how the hell is that fair ? someone else has done that job for him over the last 42 years yet HE gets to keep the pension from it !! irish politics is over run with cronyism and nepotism and the likes of kenny who take over the seats of their fathers without being properly elected by the people . time the rules were changed – if a td or minister steps down or dies there should be a bye election – not just allow his son ,daughter or dog to take over  the position . irish politics is  corrupt to its rotten stinking core !!
What nonsense ..He was a totally inept leader , no accountability , false promises , not a leadership bone in his body ..It’s immoral really to hand him just a rich reward ..
  Examine the British Prime Minister’s salary and pension – It is no where near the Irish Taoiseach’s.  The political elite in Ireland live in a world of their own. Servants of the people ? I do not think so !
 hahaha u are  winding us up , ? arnt u ?
Child poverty doubled on his watch, and homelessness and trolley numbers hit record highs. We also had a dodgy IOU between the central bank and the exchequer converted into 40 years worth of debt our grandkids will still be paying back.So, I think its fair to say he does not deserve that size pension, and also the poll is the worst clickbait I’ve come across in a long time.
 well just as a counterpoint, all of those things are a direct result of the major economic crash that he did inherit. Not giving him a pass for everything, but your basic premise is BS.
 incorrect, they are a result of actions taken after the crash
 and whats that got to do with his pension, 15 years ago you wouldnt have bat a eye about it, your just pointing out how  bad the governments policies are not, these pensions have been place for years dealing with the homless isnt going to stop his pension
 No No No stop the lies. He CONTINUED everything Fianna Fail started and blamed Fianna Fail for it. Stop lying your not talking to fools. He made the choices fully aware and he targeted the most vulnerable and protected the super rich. Why do you think they love him in Brussels. He save all their losses.
 It would save millions which could be put back into the state. Basic maths.
 so is SF responsible for all homelessness and child poverty in northern ireland or does your double standards stop at the border?
 didnt the shinners take pensions for MP jobs that they never even showed up for? have the shinners any morals at all?
 No child poverty has not doubled on his watch. The figures only go to 2015 and the numbers suffering from deprivation have edged up from 6.2% in 2010 to 8.7% they will be a lot lower now as the chances of poverty are 22% if unemployed and 2% if employed, the number of unemployed has fallen from 10% in 2015 to 6.7% today.Creating jobs is the only route out of poverty.

 Ah, here, now, Paul, don’t be bringing your auld facts to this discussion.Can’t you see I am in a state of permanent juvenile indignation and outrage. I’ll present whatever alternative facts I like in my unflinching support of Sinn Fein.Good lad.
 the problem with these pensions, Edna’s for example is you are rewarding incompetence and corruption.
@Paul Meade. true bringing in a minimum wage will feed, clothe, heat, pay for education, tax and insure a car, pay a t.v license, pay household charge, pay water charge.Likewise a rrw hours a day or few days a week. An extra tenner while doing a course will have these families cracking open the champers.
Mass Immigration continued unchecked also.
How could getting about € 2700 per week not be excessive…. Seriously
Of course Enda’s pension is excessive, just like all senior public servants, but when one considers what Ahern, Cowen and the other ministers in charge while the economy collapsed are on, I don’t begrudge him one cent of it. Despite all the criticism of him Ireland has largely prospered under Kenny’s care when it could have nose dived. Maybe one day, but it has never happened to my knowledge, some of these over paid politicians on several pensions might voluntarily hand back a third or so of it as a gesture to the Irish public who suffered the cuts caused by their bad performance while in office.
 ilinformed fantasist, homelessness figures havs tripled since 2011, evictions are out of control, people who are working can’t afford rent so are sleeping on the floor of Merchant’s Quay, I know because I visited there so do your research.
 educate your self and join  this group on fb FIGHT THE WATER TAX SCAM  ;-)
Doubt it is means tested like the old age pension. If he is earning other money from public speaking it should be.
 Excellent point.
 If you pay towards the old age pension it isn’t means tested. If you haven’t then it is means tested. Nothing wrong with that.
 did he ‘pay ‘ towards his pension then reg? or did we the tax payer pay it on his behalf -? i thought these gold plated pensions were one of the ‘perks’ of the job  and that they were paid for from the public purse not the td’s own pockets !
Contributory pension is not means tested. Get facts right.
Imagine a job where for 30 odd years you get to sit in the background and have little input to the work at hand.You get the job because your Father had the job previously.You give up your teaching job and put that job on hold, but remember you have started the pension trail already!You know that if the new job does not want you anymore you are safe in the knowledge that you can just go back to your teaching job and take up where you left off.Now if you need extra time off on this new job then you just vote for it with the other workers and it arrives, no justification to anyone, it just arrives as if by magic.Similarly if you need a pay rise at any time then again you just vote for it and it arrives,make sure of course that you get lots of money because it makes the job look important.If anyone objects you can just say ‘I’m worth it’ and everyone accepts it.You don’t actually need to turn up at the designated job site all the time but if you do then you get extra money.If you have to get to the site to work you have a car that is either driven for you or you get to choose how much expenses on top of your pay that you can claim.Don’t worry if your claims are a little askew, just submit them on time and they will be paid.You can even decide on a circuitous route to arrive at the job and claim for that, or if you have friends in an other distant country, hey just give them a call and stay on for hours.Don’t worry about paying for anything like that along the way.OK if someone asks you to pay you just pay up but hey don’t worry, you wont lose your job or anything serious like that and you can probably claim it as a tax expense.And if you choose to use your house for ‘working at home’ then you can claim more money. And roof tax or anything like that, Nah, that’s not for you, after all aren’t you working from home.If you get peckish or would like a few beers at any time, even when you are supposed to be working then just go to the subsided Bar and Restaurant and enjoy.If there is anything to pay then just get them to put it on the tab.Just make sure that if there is any important work coming up that might need overtime then go for a few drinks first.If you need to go anywhere just call up the private jet that is waiting and get on board.Don’t worry about the expense.Hey – you might even get promoted – you could become the leader of your own work gang.Wow – more money is coming your way.Don’t worry about the work aspect, work advisors will tell you what to do and when to do it – heck they will even tell you what to say and when to say it – just think of the extra money you are getting.Now there is even more travel involved in being the leader of this work gang but again it’s all for free.Then it’s time to retire – wow, you are so young – but hey don’t forget the pensions !Just count your pensions, yes multiple pensions – now you could hardly survive on just one pension could you.Oh yeah before you leave this job here is a bonus for you(It’s more than other job workers get even from richer countries but heck so what, you’re worth it…)But hey you don’t get to leave just yet, just take some time off to count your pensions and bonuses because you get to go to the back of the house again until the next big shuffle.
 comment of day in my opinion
 I can imagine actually. Welcome to world politics. I can’t think of any government off hand that puts its people first
Leech got fatter :(What’s new ?
 you ever worked in the same job for 42 years ? Didn’t think so,so what would you know !
Might aswell of won the Lotto..
 he does every month
If he was getting one euro it would still be excessive
How do you make that out. He has paid into a pension for 40 years
 over paid. He paid nothing that wasn’t given him. Ye will condemn people paying back welfare and ruthlessly demand they be slaughtered but a parasite gets justified by the likes of you. Sick people.
 Paying back social welfare?
 wrong we have paid into his pension for 42 years
 he paid nothing he has been living off the hardworking Irish taxpayer and will do until his death.
 because he’s NOT worth it very simple
 i dont think he did ACTUALLY ‘pay over 40 years’  dont senior politicians and public service get their pension contribution paid by the tax payer ? so not ACTUALLY his money to begin with !
What ever about the annual payment what’s the lump sum about ??? As Taoiseach I suppose the annual sum is appropriate . Although they all seem to get ridiculous pensions for four years work.
 He’s been a TD for 40 odd years and a govenment minister aswell so it’s not just for being Taoiseach for the last six years. Still excessive in my opinion.
 well fair enough but what’s the lump sum about though Reg do you know ? Surely an annual amount of that much is enough.
 Lump sums are a normal part of private and public pensions. You can extract a certain amount from your retirement fund upon retirement, tax free. Right now it’s 200K, and you can take a further 500K tax free.http://www.pensionsauthority.ie/en/LifeCycle/Tax/Tax_on_lump_sums_at_retirement/As such, there’s a tax benefit for the private sector in having this ability (they would be taxed on a purchased annuity at normal rates, subject to normal thresholds and tax credits. This tax benefit needs to be fairly distributed to the public sector too, so there’s an agreement to give some of their accrued pension benefits as a tax free lump sum.Most people plan to use this lump sum facility at retirement.That’s not to say the annual pension isn’t excessive – it will be in this case. But the lump sum is a pretty ordinary amount for someone earning over, say, 70k, to extract upon retirement, from their fund.
 Oops, that should read amounts between 200-500K at 20% tax
Most ridiculous poll ever .
 how so?
 the answer to your question is in taking a look at the huge amount thumbs up it got compared to yours, which at the the time of this post was a big fat ZERO
 because it should have been a 100% yes ffs!
How is this even an issue – or a poll – it’s click bait – people who set the rules and friendly with those who enforce the pension legislation having large pensionsSeriously??????
 Nail on the head.
 Who or what criteria is used to set their entitlement.
My pension is similar. What’s the deal. That’s his business.
 WoW really. Aren’t you wonderful?
 not his business when the state has to pay this. I have worked in PS for 30 years. My pension, after OAP deduction will be €5k, after contributing for 40 years.
 What do you do?
  If you worked in the PS for 40 years and are only getting an annual pension of 5k then there’s seriously something wrong or you haven’t been working full time for those 40 years
By the sounds of it – lies in bed rolling in €50 notes
 at a guess I’d say Stephen was PRSI exempt, so wasnt paying towards the state pension, so really what he’s getting back is the combined pension of both. Maybe he can clarify.
Indeed, my understanding is that there’s a class of PRSI for public sector workers where employer’s PRSI (the main component) is not paid. As such, they don’t get a contributory OAP, rather the total pension (which in this case happens to be 5k more than contributory OAP) is being provided based on his salary history.
I don’t believe so. PS classes (pre 95 ees I think) are B C D H from memory and employer pays on all. Only circumstances I can think of are that wage is beneath the threshold for paying or this is a subsidiary employment so class M which would be nil liability. Some pensioners continue to work in PS so are paid their pension and a salary separately.
 havent reached 40 years yet. Post ’93 i pay both PRSI and pension contributions. Pension is then calculated minus the OAPie; pension is half your wage (38,000/2= 19,000) minud OAP(14,000) = 5,000 pension (plus OAP)
 But your PRSI is much less?  Are you on Class B, which is 0.9% as opposed to 4% for Class A.
 not less. ClassA like everyone else.
 If you are post 1995, then your Class is B or D, it cannot be A.  Class A was only introduced in 1995 and the way payment to the pension scheme altered.
 Sorry, should read, if you are pre 1995
 made permantant post 95 so class A PRSI. Plus superann pension contribution, plus widows and orphans contribution, plus pension levy etc.Believe me, i have questioned this 1000 times. When i retire i get my pension, which i contribute to, minus the OAP whic i also contribute to.
  Do you mind me asking what sector of the PS do you work in? Is it Civil Service/Health/Education? What is your pension scheme? Why is your pension based on half of your salary??
 I keep trying to reply to you but it will not post it up.  Journal.ie, why do some replies work and others don’t?
 3000 a year for each year of service, he’d a done much better at the lowest level of the civil service.
 local Authority. Superannuation pension scheme.
 can’t be right Stephen. You are in the DB scheme so you should be guaranteed a lump sum and 2/3 of final salary based on your service. Your pension contributions should be small when you take the OAP abatement into account.
Maybe 2/3 Sean. I need to check that out.My point is I contribute to both OAP and superann pension. The 2/3 (or 1/2) is reduced by the OAP amount. So even if my pension is worth €20,000 it is reduced by my OAP amount.
 There is not such thing as a lump sum and 2/3rds your final salary, it does not exits in either the private sector or the public sector, it would be in breach of all laws.    The maximum you can get is 2/3rd salary as a pension and if you take a lump sum, part of that pension is commuted.  This is where the 50% salary and 1.5 times salary of lump sum come in.  Anything above this is in breach of overall pension law that applies to all.
 I have heard this scenario played over the airwaves as if you in the private sector get 2/3rd of your salary and a lump sum but we in the public sector only get 50% as a pension.  You cannot get 2/3rds of Final Salary as a Pension plus a lump sum.  There are no laws that allow this, it is a total impossibility.
Not only is it excessive, its obscene, its a slap in the face for all families struggling to make ends meet and keep a roof over their heads, for old and sick folk lying on trolleys, for the homeless and disabled , yep big bucks for what ???
And these figures do not include his pension as a teacher (principle) that he also gets after only a couple of years teaching.
 its actually sick when people int his country have to live on 100 to 188 euro a week. It is sick.
I don’t have an issue with the pension amount. He was the Leader of our country for 6 years so the amount should reflect the stature of the position. It’s the lump sum that’s a kicker. Why such a huge amount or any amount? The pension should be enough.
Everyone that has a pension pot is entitled to take a % as a tax free limo sum. He was a TD for 40 odd years so the lump sum is probably an appropriate amount.
 Leader???
He has held arguably the toughest job in the civil service, none of us wouldn’t be capable of doing it, few people are. When you compare it to private pensions for CEOs etc., then it’s perfectly reasonable. It’s a lot higher than average but then so was his role and responsibility. I’m not a Kenny groupie by any means but he has worked hard in a thunderously difficult job for 40 years
 How do you make that out ? Senior civil servants write out all his scripts he only has to recite and even then he makes a blunder of it. Have you not noticed him wearing his earpiece lately so that he can be told what to say if asked an  awkward question ?
 well said there.
 A trained monkey would have done a better job than him.
The monkey would not have required training
“Do you think Enda Kenny’s pension payout is excessive?” Is that a serious question??
Just doing a check here. So the word i typed in my comment was G O B S H I T E but I am  not allowed to put it together. Can I ask the journal why? Is this section so ultra conservative that it won’t even all me to say a simple term like that?
 I just want to know what algorithms ye are using to censor words. Was it designed in the Fianna Gael politician?
Why should length of ‘service’ (it galled me just to type that…) have anything to do with the pension of a politician? He was ridiculously well paid the whole time…better paid than than most politicians world wide, includinf the US President…and for most of it he didn’t do an awful  lot.Can anyone remember Enda Kenny doing anything notable during the Celtic Tiger years other than complain that FF weren’t doing enough to feed it?
That’s how defined benefit pensions generally work.
Able to earn multiple pensions for a few years work? That’s excessive everywhere except in the Bermuda triangle of politics.
Let’s see if he vows to give any of it back, considering the vast majority of people he represents think it’s far too much.
Soon he’ll expect a Hogan-style bump in earnings in Europe with a cushy number as playoff for his devotion as EU lapdog!
It’s an obscene amount for him to trouser,but for me the biggest issue as a taxpayer..is politicians received multiple pensions from the public purse..give them a pension by all means..but only one publicly funded…if they want more,let them buy one..and hope whoever is in govt don’t use it as a piggy bank
40 years a TD, 6 of those as Taoiseach and I don’t know how many as a Minister.Seems quite reasonable to me and generally far less than equivalent private sector.
 his pension pot is supposed to be worth 2million – that’s a plain lie. For a private sector worker to gain those entitlements, they would have to amass a fund worth in excess of 4 million. Getting into the dail is better than a lottery win.
Considering he has been paid way more than he should have been for many years and the current national dept we have. Their pensions should be linked closely to the average national wage agreements.
Any Irish politician who has spent decades in the Dail, including years of ministerial office, and especially the highest in the land- Taoiseach or Minister for Finance, is entitled to be paid a pension in accordance with the experience ordinary citizens had under their control; Enda Kenny should be fined 2 grand a week, every week, for the rest of his life, Bertie and Brian Cowen 3 grand weekly, and Michael Noonan should bankrupted!
 so that is whats meant by a sense of entitlement. I often wondered.
 Can’t tell if you’re agreeing with me, or arguing?!
Is he worth €6 million??? No chance
Add to 40 plus years of salary and expenses.  Nice number
Do we think his pension is excessive?Which one he has three state pensions.Be worth some of you folk reading Callan’s piece in the times today.It would scare you the trail of destruction himself and Noonan left after themselves to-date.
Bet he didn’t look forward to anything like that in his school teaching days! I wonder what qualifications he had to warrant such a huge pension, other than being the son of a politician?
Disgraceful disgraceful. And all our money he wasted over the years too!
Politicians and top civil servants salary/expenses/bonuses etc are sickeningly and grotesquely high “specially when measured against results,, but more significantly it serves to separate them from the reality and impact of their decisions on the general population, politicians etc must be effected by the decisions they make otherwise certain sections of society will be constantly made to suffer
How the hell do 21% of people think this is ok???? Seriously, what planet are you living on??
I’m always surprised that when judges, ceo’s or politicians pensions are mentioned there’s an out cry of “we can’t touch them it’s unconstitutional”.I had my contractual pension slashed by an order signed into law by Micheal D Higgans on Xmas morning
Don’t forget about his teachers pension too.
If he had some decency, he should donate it…
Many people think politicians are lazy, but it is one of the toughest jobs , 16 hour days 7 days a week , Even working on holidays.I don’t like Kenny but I don’t believe he is corrupt in any way , so I would much rather him getting a payout than some of the others.Like him or loath him he has led the country towards a better future,.
 I bet you are pretty well off yourself and have no idea what it’s like on the breadline. If you don’t believe he’s as corrupt as the rest of them, you must live in a very special world.
 should try working in the catering industry – 16 hour days -7 days a week and for a pittance to what these greedy bstards are getting and if you make a mistake or cock something up your fired- no pension pot ,no ‘disappointment fund’ nothing ! where do you get this 16 hrs day -7 day week from? the dail is not sitting on a monday and only half day friday -no sat or sunday sitting – so thats only 4&1/2 days a week not 7 – yes i know not all the work is done in the dail chamber – but then how many times do you actually see more than a few of them in the chamber -only time is when their is a vote on their pay or ‘entitlements’ .  the public service do most of the ‘ground work ‘ for them – script writing -telling them what to say ,when to say it , where to be and when to be there  – as for ‘holidays’ just how many days has the current dail sat since the last election? more than 300 ? 250? 200? less than 200 ? 150 ? 100? with all the ‘extra’ little holidays they have added to their already rather generous holiday allowance i would think it is less than 150 . not bad in 18 months !and dont forget -they are paid extra just to turn up for ‘work’ and get paid to get there ! .last but not least your last comment should be amended to read -” he has led the top 5% of this country towards a better future – for the vast majority he has done the opposite !
Yes of course it is excessive…and its a stupid question really…The phrase “not one red cent more’ comes to mind….
I’m always surprised that when judges, ceo’s or politicians pensions are mentioned there’s an out cry of “we can’t touch them it’s unconstitutional”.I had my contractual pension slashed by an order signed into law by Micheal D Higgans on Xmas morning
Morally corrupt.
IT is excessive, but one exclusive to him alone. The only thing I can say in his case is that he has served over 40 years in the Dail. He has been well paid, but he also paid loads of Income Tax, PRSI and pension contribution, but in the ordinary scale of things their pensions are excessive.
 we all paid taxes he is no different. How can ye Gaelers justify masses of money yet ye hate someone getting 188 a week on welfare who worked and paid their taxes. Double hypocritical standards is the norm for Fianna Gael.
If it can be justified, why not? But justify the money first, as the people of this country pay his ridiculous wage, we should see if it’s fair or not
Probably worth it to get rid of him.
Quote: “It is morally wrong, unjust and unfair to tax a persons home”
No wonder they want the daughter to “inherit”the seat. Who wants to let that kind of money out of family possession?
Stupid question. Of course it is. All their pensions are excessive. Shouldn’t be getting them until national retirement age either.
Based on performance, yes.

Qualifications, a brief time spent as a teacher thanks to Daddy getting him the job and then Daddy dies, hops on gravy train, sells the country to vulture funds, EU sycophant, Sociopath, qualifies him for the guillotine, not a pension.
A pension for being a useless cowardly establishment idiot who sold out country???
His politician pension or the teaching one?
No he’s the Taoiseach and was a TD for 40 years.  A lot of people in very average jobs get as much or more.
 People in average jobs don’t get a pension of 120k plus per year. Nowhere near.
 Is it possible to be so dense.
 What do you think is the average wage and the average pension?
 sorry, what I meant was average jobs compared with being Taoiseach. Must Managing Directors of companies with a few hundred employees would be getting more. And a lot of our business leaders do a very average to poor job. The Taoiseach getting a lump sum of 378k isn’t outrageous.  120k is high but he is in the top tier of jobs.
Do you know Joan Burton changed the pension entitlement to double the amount of contributions needed to qualify for a pension in 2012 and gave no forgiveness to women who took time off to have children before 1994 which means that all the ladies retiring now who would have been 44 in 1994 who took off time to have children and started working at 17/18 which was the norm in the day are now finding despite 30 plus years of work they are not entitled to a full pension.  Age action and ICA are trying to fight it Its extremely unfair and mostly affecting women Joan Burton did this at the same time she cut the telephone allowance etc for pensioners no one knew she did it until people who thought they would get their state pension after years of work applied for it
thousand of CEO’s get far bigger pensions for a lot less responsibility.  I would have tied his pension to performance and have it underpinned by KPI’s.
Is a laugh golden handshake didn’t we pay his salary over the years no one should get a lump sum and there pension should be capped to the national wage
Kenny nor any other politician deserves these obscene payments.
Ironic that this moron that has shafted the Irish taxpayer for so long. Will still be a burden on them when he is shuffling round crossmolina out of harms way.
Yes i think it’s excessive especially when he done such a shite job!!
That’s nothing compared to what Retiring CEO’s from Banks & various Companies get! He was Prime Minister!
 when.
firstly, anyone who wishes can apply to join the civil (or public) service and get promotion or try to get elected to partake in the running of the country – the conditions of employment are as set out – whether the pay and conditions (and pensions) are too large is open to debate but one must remember that being Taoiseach or one of the top paid civil servants is a 24/7/365 job and not one that you can walk away from at 5pm on a Friday and not have to worry about until 9am Monday – this it one of the many things taken into account at arriving at the pay and conditions and pensions.It would be interesting to compare his retirement benefits with those of the CEO of a large multinational with a budget and comparable work force to see how private and public pensions compare before deciding that his retirement benefits are “excessive”  – after all it is only fair to compare like with like and accept or condemn everyone’s pension on the same basis.That said I so think there is something wrong with the income/pensions in the private sector that is market forces or union driven as well as in the public sector where income in either sector is excessive, but the definition of excessive is subjective and to someone on 200 a week 500 a week could be excessive whereas to someone on 500 a week 2000 might be excessive – which actually makes the poll a nonsense – as there is no definition of excessive
 you do know the big difference here is accountability. None in government or civil service as opposed to private enterprise.
Good old school teachers…
So all the photo ops means nothing now? Goodbye suckers…
As ive said before a high salary is good for politicians if paid low will be bought by big business and also only the rich will end up in government…
Enda is only 66 and should not get this overpaid pension until he is 70 yrs old. Like the rest of us. Plus I think for public servant, it is too much to be paid for a pension. As for stress levels in his job as Taoiseach, he has already been paid for this, reflected in his salary while working. And his golden handshake bonus is obscene, whatever happened to the “gold watch” gift? Most of us don’t even get that.He will most likely ,while claiming his pension, get another job as a columnist for a newspaper, perhaps even a private position in Brussels or the ECB and that is all without being means tested for whatever investments he has and made over the years.Yes, this all leads to being set for life, almost as good as, if not better than winning the Lotto. Which darkens the their motivation to become Taoiseach in the first place. You don’t have to do a good job, you get a company car and driver, as much pay as the US president if not more, a fat pension, free travel, free lunch, free medical, a get out of jail free card, no taxes to pay EVER, and you don’t even have to pay your tab at the Leinster bar. Who wouldn’t want to be Leader, beats working for Aldi or McDonalds!
Personally I think he deserves it. He has done a very good job as taoiseach. Compared to when he took over the country it is in excellent shape and he has put in a serious amount of graft to get us there. So why not?
 it’s actually in worse shape than when he took over the country. The world economy has improved and so has world banking and as a result Ireland has improved. That’s nothing to do with Enda Kenny or Michael Noonan for that matter.
 if that’s the case then shouldn’t FF be absolved of all blame for the crash?
 true a lot of it wasn’t their fault.That doesn’t change the rampant corruption and cronieism in f.f/f.g
Shocking but not surprised, Politics needs to be cleaned up, a politician should only be allowed to serve three terms and the only pension they should receive when they are retired or replaced is the state pension that they will receive when they are 65 and above. Greed has destroyed Irish democracy and it is sowing the seeds for a French style revolution in the future.
Enda Kenny retires with a pension of 126,000 euro after 42 yrs service, I get 35,000 euro after 40 yrs in nursing profession. I m not cribbing but surely this has to be grossly unfair. Is it any wonder would be politicians are breaking down the doors to get into the gravy train that is Leinster house. We need a revolution to stop this gross abuse of public money. How dare they.
Will he be off to Brussels soon ?  Surely he is entitled to a reward for service to the European Commission in the near future !
 he’s as bent as an shave hook
ENDA give us all a little moral compass @ give ur pension to the homeless
He should pay loads of taxes
You did a good job Michael, impossible to please everyone but you did a good job.
 He rode a wave and didn’t have the balls make decisions in the best interest of the people he was elected to represent. If he was CFO of a company and didn’t make decisions in the best interest of the shareholders he’d have been fired long ago.
 He needs to answer the questions as to what he knew about  the “Grace Scandal”
 not quite true. His shareholders were and are banks vulture funds and DOB. He made fantastic decisions for them.
 I used to have respect for Noonan years ago but his treatment of the hepatitis victims a while back was nothing short of contemptible. As finance minister he has pandered to European banks and become an ally of the vulture funds that are responsible for people being made homeless.  He as much as any of his predecessors has turned this country from a society to an economy.If ever you needed a reminder of who never to vote for both he and Kenny are there to remind you.
Ehhh…………………… not quite true there Rocky.He was elected, you are correct. He did what he did with the sanction of cabinet.He was elected again, by those same shareholders you claim should have fired him and represented his constituents exactly the same way as he had done in the previous five years.So it’s you that’s not happy not his constituents.
 The delusion in this country is at crisis levels it would seem. Some seriously deluded people.
Bankrupt IMF-run economy with 15% unemployment, turned into a booming economy with near full-employment.History will treat the man kindly.
 he did in his swiss
 Idiot. He raped this country and sold it to vulture funds. You are pathetic with your simpleton comments.
 Only liars like you and Gael believe that. We all know that figure was pulled out of Endas ar*e. You are pathetic.
  Noonan’s fans are out singing his praises, not a mention of the potential millions he made himself while he was robbing the rest of us to sweeten The EU.  He is in a bad situation if he makes a run before Leo or Simon throw him out.  With Kenny and Noonan gone there are only another 148 we hope get the message and f off.
 so good a job that he forgot about the aib shares….. Yeah another great performance by this shambles of a government.
 his answer was to increase taxes on the coping class without any thought of peoples ability to pay , he also guillotined the property tax through the dail  on the family home, a tax Kenny said years ago was immoral and a vampire tax.
 jesus i cant believe your comment has got over 500 thumbs up. There is definitely no hope for this country
 i am not the only one, thank God.
 If the truth about him is swept under the carpet.Evil personified.
 hopefully he will be history soon enough, he has been a burden on Irish taxpayers for too long.
 you assume that anybody who is not on the live register is employed.
 most of the likes were generated in the f.g fraperoom. About 10% are genuinely deluded followers of the f.g cult.
 a blueshirt bullshitter. King of Austerity
 ok Buddy with your “idiot”and “raped” comments, wind your neck in. I’m not interested in taking insults from the likes of you. If you don’t like it hop on a plane and get better, don’t just park your arse whining like a baby. Move around, improve, get stuck in.
 He was the best available man to do the hard job and he did it well. History will show he was a good man. So easy to be on the sidelines and throwing rocks but not equipped or prepared to do the hard work.
 ‘Abolish the USC’ – ‘Let’s keep the recovery going’ – wonder how that worked out….
 I think they decided to maintain welfare as much as possible instead. A wise decision as it turned out. The €4B that the usc brings in is an astronomical amount of revenue and can’t be done without.
 In other words‘Say anything to get elected’or in the LAB way‘Isn’t that what you say in an election’Around here we would call them liars…
  no actually he placed debts onto everyone’s kids that aren’t theirs.Find me anyone who thinks that’s a good job.
 The Hep C Minister is heartless man AND he financially  screwed the country with his neo liberal and stupid pro European politics. Feck off and don’t come back Noonan
 Might shock you to know the country is still bankrupt.Existing on unsustainable debt. Noonan is a charleton. Sickens me to think this man will walk off with a limp sum and a huge pension. Hope he dies soon.
 Great records with digits and banksaving , including his own bonds.As human being , he is bankrupt in all senses exept monitory.
 “hope he dies soon” and “sickened that he gets a lump sum and pension”. Just take a moment and listen to yourself…..
 if any td was an employee of a private company they would be fired !
 Of course it’s a fantastic amount of money but it’s workers money to do as they please with. Originally a temporary tax!!!
What a day fantastic !
 it would be if social welfare was dropped and universal tax eliminated.
 social welfare dropped? As in its too high?
 188 is a lot of money for doing f@#k all to be fair. Especially when there are jobs there.
 jobs in rural Ireland too? People live outside cities dont you know?
 why dont u  go after the multinationals who wont pay their fair share instead of the poor?
 My god you are one dummy, What jobs fool. Cheap two bits ones is it. Slave labour is it. Everyone has bills to pay. I bet you you don’t live on 188 a week. I’d love to get my hands on vermin like you.
 chris are you saying you wouldn’t take a minimum wage job?.
  If anything, people on social welfare are the parasites. Do you even know what that word means? He’s saying to cut it, therefore he’s the opposite of a parasite.I’m quite aware this senile idiot along with the rest of the shower are talking shite about unemployment figures though (look at tax-take). He’s only stepping down because the house of cards is about to come tumbling down.We’re paying for that dole of yours in case you didn’t know! I’d love to live down the country, but there’s no work there so I’ve to face facts and live in Dublin to find a job. And take a fecking chill pill, so aggressive.
 yes they go mad for that 188. Unfortunately the jobs probably just scrape past the 188. By the time you pay to get there and back its not worthwhile.
 nothing to stop you renting in Dublin, its only 500 a week and if you were earning 450 you would only be down 50, before you clothe and feed yourself.
Once he’s held accountable when the findings from project eagle are announced. Up to his oxters in it.
  Accountable really on a story about Irish politics……We don’t do accountable the best we can hope for is a tribunal that costs a few million and states the obvious that Noonan and Nama shafted the nation for Billions – Like all tribunals there will be not a single repurcussion
 He also needs to answer to the survivors of abuse why land given over by the religious has a new school built on it in Limerick. “Nothing against Limerick “
 there will be no findings from project eagle
  Unfortunately, the record shows that he won’t be held accountable. Like his daylight robbing of our pensions, the system ensures that no one is ever held accountable in Ireland
Whatever else about him he has been an excellent minister for finance.He stood up against pressure from Europe to maintain our corporate tax rate. Had he given into this our unemployment rate would be significantly higher today.I’m aware he has PLENTY of flaws but history will look on him as one of the best ministers for finance we have ever had.
 good point – I don’t like the man but credit is due to him for that: even though he made himself unpopular defending our corporate tax rate.I hope whomever takes over will do the same.
 the unemployment rate is down because of not attaching emigration figures to it, and back to work schemes manipulating the figures. In the 1980′s recession, when unemployment was equally bad, these same donkeys simply removed everybody over 55 from the unemployment figures and put them in a new category called the pre retired. Same leopard, same spots!
  that’s completely bogus. More people employed in the state then ever before? Or let me guess that’s just made up as well?You don’t have to like the guy or vote for him but at least make your case with facts.
 he was the worst minister for finance, unless you are a junior bondholder…just like himself. A great day for the country when this nasty bully goes. Disgusting individual.
 and if a bit of creativity was shown we wouldnt need to rely on multinationals so much pure laziness a 2 yr old could do it!   We re known as nothing more than a tax haven amongst financiers something to be proud of i suppose!  Soon enough our coporate tax rate will be harmonised.
 History will look on him truthfully that he was a heartless clone for the EU and a lapdog.
 try telling that to the hundreds of irish families who lost someone to suicide as a result of decisions made after the financial crisis. The banks should have been let fail like they did in Iceland and we’d be rid of a major scourge of society
 idiot, there are more employed because there are a lot more people living here than before (in recent history)
 i agree hopefully the new one has the balls to stand up to the unions so our country not broke again
 He was and is a European bum boy like the rest of the FG traitors
You must be a steakholder.
 *stakeholder.You must be both verbally and economically illiterate.
Best news yet
A seismic moment indeed
 no 7 million in a Isle of Mann bank account for you then. With that bad attitude.
Let’s hope the next finance minister keeps up his good work with the economy.Tall order.
 Its clear you are brainless. Every single comment you make is fake and plastic just to annoy people. You have zero integrity. You are disgusting and you will get whats due and your pathetic parasitic party.
 he is a FG plant, ignore him.
Can’t explain to you how much I would like to give you an almighty slap. It might get some sense into you but i’d say you’re far, far beyond that. I genuinely feel sorry for anyone who has the misfortune of knowing you. Please don’t have kids but god help them if you already have.
Today just keeps getting better!
Wonderful news, the week just keeps getting better. I would go out this evening for a drink to celebrate but ohh I nearly forgot I don’t have two cent to rub together never mind enough for a drink or two.
JOY TO THE WORLD , The man that hated the ordinary working man/woman in this country, This is the best news I have ever heard, there isn’t words to describe this person,the worst finance minister since the foundation of this state. I had given up but suddenly there is a small bit of hope.
 well said! he s not the only one though
I suppose when they were together, they could back up and defend each others incompetence.  But when one is gone, the other is horribly exposed.
Rats and sinking ship comes to mind. Hmmmm…
His head must have got too big to fit in the trough. Still, nice few pensions to gorge on.
I hope Noonan apologises to the countless woman who enjured so much pain and suffering because of the blood scandal.
 well said Chris
Well done Michael. You steered the country well through the crisis & recovery and you kicked the IMF out of town. Thank you.
 Noonan just followed the plan agreed between FF and the IMF. Maybe you should congratulate FF?
 how much as FG paying you nowadays? Is it still by the amount of words you spout?
 the only reason the kicked the inf out of town was that they are going to tackle salaries and pensions of tds , the cost of lawyer s and barristers
Inflicted crisis on the disabled, sick and low paid. Further divided an already divided society. Still we won on the water charge and the laptop tax.
Brigid McCole, Grace, nama, etc. Any of those three thing should have seen him jailed. Disgusting excuse for a human being.
Ding Dong the witch is dead, which old witch? Both of them
Woo hoooo! Both of them together!! Noonan too!
Kenny and Noonan finally gone.This is a good for Ireland.
The vultures will be so disappointed
Was a good finance minister …..However allowing NAMA to sell property cheaply in a rising market was big mistake….Battersy power station was sold for  £700 million….One year later was sold on for £1.1 billion by new owner….
Do you think it’s possible his replacement will actually tax vulture funds and stop pandering to the ultra wealthy? FG! I think not
 I guess you would prefer he just hand out money and cut taxes hand over fist? Like Bertie and McCreevey?By the way, nobody supports what the vulture funds are doing, but just remember when we had nothing in 2008, and you couldn’t give property away – those vulture funds had the cash, and we readily took it.
He stood firm and held the ship on course so I have much respect for him as minister and as a man who has been through so much personally in recent years.Is he without sin ? I guess not…..our insurance premiums are 400% greater as a direct result of his intervention but I suspect that will revert to normal business soon enough.So ….fair play to you Mr. Noonan and thank you for your service.
 Blue Shirt or deluded, can’t make my mind up?
 both!
 the nazis held a steady ship for many yrs too
 its tough reading your comment. Its hard to believe there are brain dead people like you who believe lies. He destroyed this country.
 agreed
May as well just call for another election so….
 and let FF take over again? Why would you want that?
Thanks for the 60 billion
A man who every time he was a minister presided over some scandal or other.  Should have been kicked out long ago.
Michael Noonan has been a very good servant to this state. He has done a very good job as Minister for Finance over the last 6 years to bring our economy back from the brick. Now anyone who wants a job has a job, weekly there are announcements of jobs coming on stream. These are all as a result of the decisions he made as Minister. Yes many of his decisions were unpopular but were necessary and when people review his legacy in years to come they will realize what a good Minister for Finance he actually was. Remember this man could have easily retired prior to the 2011 election. He didn’t need the money, the hassle, the stress or the abuse he received for help this country in its hour of need. Its very easy for people behind a keyboard or even the opposition to give out and shout that there are other ways to do things but none of them had to make the hard decisions that Minister Noonan had to. The economy was on life support when he took over, now that it is functioning again it will support the correction of other elements of society. In Iceland private people lost their savings, in Greece social welfare payments were cut to 25%. Thankfully with the steady hand and brain of Minister Noonan nothing so drastic happened in this country. People who understand how the economy works are grateful to Minister Noonan for all his hard, diligent work.
 Michael noonan is nothing more than a parasite who pandered to the super rich and made sure Irelands assets were sold off. He benefited nobody here only the rich. Obviously you are one of them. We have no healthcare or decent jobs and we are 200 billion in debt thanks to Noonan and pig Kenny. You are deluded or paid by Fianna Gael to come on and try to spew venomous lies. You could have spared yourself the trouble because everyone on here knows the truth about them. Parasites best describes Noonan and Kenny. Good Riddance.
 By the way I study and I know exactly how the economy in third level so keep your lies for idiots who believe it like yourself.
 very well said Anthony. A steady hand on the tiller at a critical time in our history. His replacement in finance will have a hard job to do as good as Michael Noonan.
 How do you know Anthony is rich?
 what class are you in? You should be doing your homework, not on here with the grown ups.
 WE are in debt because of the money that WE borrowed.
 Anthony, today alone there were 62 evictions in Tralee courthouse.http://tinyurl.com/lpbzvlxAnd that is just one day out of 365.Minister Noonan and his ilk forgot about the people.Nothing will change until we can get rid of the FFFGLAB Ltd. organisations.They are only in it for themselves and their organisations not for you and I.
 you left out the bit about agreeing to placing debts on your children for years to come.
@sean, but the benefit class on here will have you think that it was noonan and enda that borrowed the money so we could all have second homes, and not second homes to live in either, second homes as a speculative investment. But the benefit class have had their payments cut, so sitting on their asses doesn’t pay as well.
He should be in jail.
All the comments supporting Michael Noonan are intelligent well made points, with the caveat stating that “he did make mistakes and have flaws”. Those comments made against him are competing for best insult – it really demonstrates the intellect of the people behind. Being minister for finance is not just about handing as much money to the social welfare as is possible, its about understand global financial markets, interest rates, bond rates, FOREX and a whole host of other financial issues that most on here couldn’t begin to comprehend, let alone actually execute. But hey, you can write a good insult, so I guess you’re all set.
 You miss the point – a lot of us do get financial instruments and Noonan explicitly didn’t. Also the role of a minister for finance isn’t to become a financial whiz, there are a plethora of advisors and consultants to provide that information – it’s to decide on policy that is best for all citizens of Ireland. And again, Noonan failed in this front.
 Are you stupid. Who said anything about welfare. He pandered to the super rich and sold out the Irish people and sold off our assets to vulture funds. Don’t be so stupid.
 His above comment is typically condescending like Noonan. Us poor people are so stupid we don’t know economics and we should let the country be run by intelligent people like Noonan. We’ll just under a tree while God Noonan does his magic. Arrogant ignorant a** hol*s is all they are. They need to be dragged down off their pedestals and they will soon enough.
 the most basic measure of a minister of finance is the state of the economy. Sovereign debt rose from €90b to €210b under his watch. No pressure, requirement or need from anyone else, just the ineptitude of their failed hero.
 well said Larry, clowns on here have been encouraged by the mob mentality of the water protesters and scroungers.
 who will do the dragging?
He doesn’t understand finance???? Really, have you ever listened to him speak. It would be like Japanese to the likes of you.
@Christopher, vulture funds as they are now known were the only show in town in 2008. The had the cash, we were hours from bankruptcy. Noonan didn’t guarantee the bond holders so don’t try pin that on him either. You are just trotting out the same lines you’ve heard at the mob meetings with the water protestors – without giving any thought whatsoever as to what it might mean. You lack independent thinking. You are a classic sheep.
Good
Im a limerick man and I wont be shedding a tear.
 just comes across as incredibly cold & uncaring
 I also am a Limerick man and Noonan always was and is hated here. He is part of the parasite tribe. The well off rich who look down their noses on poor misfortunates struggling to exist here.
 limerick is going to have really good growth over the next few years, jobs are being created, factories are hiring and the urban regeneration is continuing. Clever people like Dennis Brosnan are involved because they see the opportunity that is at hand for Limerick. A great city and county that will go from strength to strength.
Oh glory be. I thought Kenny buggering off was music to my ears. But noonan too. Can this day get any better. Not unless a larges breasted woman of stunning looks carrying a 6 pack of beer and looking for a good time comes knocking at my door in the next few hours.
 was that woman related to the man with two pints in his hand?
The Country is slowly moving forward today. Finally two self serving sponges have left political life. Fitzgerald next please.
 Yes. Two Kun*s gone.
And make sure the lock on that closet is well and truly boltedKeep them skeletons inTo be fair to him in a time of crisis he did well but his arrogance thereafter is just unbelievable
Good
The boy wonder Simple Simon will take over from Noonan .
Another corporate governance entity leaving not 1 decision made on behalf of the people .. only corporations cause that’s were there value lies with there bosses
Thanks be to god , a two faced liar who robbed the tax payer and never paid us back like he promised . Now his partner in crime is gone he can’t stand up for himself no back up
I wish Michael Noonan all the best and thank him for his long years of service to the people of this country .  He is 74 years of age and deserves to relax and enjoy his life from now on.
 the bugger is long past his sell by date, a great day for the country with this tramp going too.
 Hopefully, he doesn’t have a politician using the state to threaten his family with jail and financial ruin if he doesn’t disappear. Just as he did.
 Aine why don’t you shove it up your H8le, He was hated simple as that.
 He surely does Aine. I wonder who will replace him?
 Not hated by right thinking people who understood the gravity of the perilous state of our finances when he took over. Michael Noonan did a remarkable job.
I  would like to say good riddance however my tax money will be paying for his over inflated pensions until I die
Mrs. Bridget McCole will be his legacy
Noon an should been put out to grass years ago.
He serviced his EU masters well
Leaving behind him the whiff of brimstone and corruption!
 he has the touch of the crypt about him
Good Riddance Scrooge
Vile toxic despicable person.
Journal could you please post an updated version of the site rules on a daily bases? I can’t think of any other way around this making the rules up as you go a long lark.Apparently calling Michael Noonan the “Grim Reaper” is not allowed but calling him a parasite is. Or was it the “Journal is becoming a Blue Shirt propaganda rag” comment?
“Grim Reaper”Is that what the IMF calls him?
 No people like Brigid McCole  (an Irish citizen) if she was alive might call him that……
Noonan to walk so the loser between Coveney and Varadkar can be given his appointment in the cabinet.
Another rat jumping the sinking ship.The man is a snake and cant be trusted
Something very suspicious about these 2 slimeballs #enda slipping into the sunset and out of the limelight, something tells me the new fine gaelers will be burying their legacys for generations that come .
I always felt that I was in a safe pair of hands with Muchael. He reminded ne of the bank managers of old, canny old geezers who would sum you up in a couple of minutes. You lot of millenials and snowflakes have probably never even spoken to a bank manager….
 You venomous comment says a lot about you. Hopefully some day you will be kicked from falling. You sound like a total Pri*k.
 haha! You accusing another of a “venomous” comment. You really need to travel or do something to broaden your horizons.
I would be prepared to bet that the people who are excoriating Micheal Noonan from a height are mainly between the ages of 25 and 35.Why? Because they are the people who subconsciously thing the ‘boom’ from 2000 to 2010 is normal.  They think sweeties all the time is what life has to give them and when they have no sweeties they whinge. Well, welcome to reality folks.
And both retire after the man fron the EU came over here to talk about Brexit, what are the chanes of this happening, it seems well time. Who pulls those strings???
Noonan. Rich Mans Friend.Working Mans spit.
An odious spiteful little man. Only a pity he’ll never be on trial for his actions.
Michael McGrath thinks Mehole Noonan did a great job…….wow. What a fecking tribute from one party animal to another. Good aLord is there no shame is these elected public officials?
Could he be a last minute candidate in the leadership battle?Just to piss us off one last time
Locally you used to see him on the doorstep . He was visible and accessible and certainly appeared to making progress on local issues. Then that changed to just seeing him at election time. Then not even his supporters knocked on the doors they just threw in leaflets.  Nationally I suppose I think he could have been more consistent to say the least but there isn’t the feeling he sold out like Labour. So not all bad but not all good. I suppose we might see more of him locally again now …’maybe
 barely had to lift a finger to get elected no doubt hope that era is gone
Dont worry about it Ms Merkel and Mr Junkers excuse my bad spelling and their offspring will always run your finances and your country if you let them Welcome to the United States of Europe USE your politicians will be no more than senators or worse council leaders begging Berlin for more money to run more buses in Tralee
All these people ‘celebrating’ currently will be griping in a few months time regardless.
About f*cking time, useless b*stard
 what have you done with your life ?
 just the normal stuff. Worked, paid taxes, bought a house, got married, raising a kid etc . Nothing interesting to you
 You just expressed the opinion of 99 per cent of Ireland and 100 per cent of Limerick.
Ha like he was going to have a choice ..
This sums up the Accidental Taoiseach & the minister for taxing the poors legacy – only the truly deluded & idiotic could ever rate them as anything other than inept & corrupt.https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/oliver-callan-why-i-won-t-miss-the-accidental-taoiseach-1.3085369?mode=amp
 so you take your political ideas from Oliver Callan. Interesting.
  I am certainly interesting Mikey boy! Your point ( if indeed you have an actual point ) steers clear of the text / facts presented in that piece and for good reason – you would forgive your rotten party & its principle dirty characters anything – idiots.
 Not my party boy, I don’t have one. Facts are the country was broke, Michael Noonan was appointed minister of finance and at the end of his term we are not broke any more.
Good riddance, couldn’t stand the man.
Just as well….he looks like he is falling apart!
My God, listen to yourself. In all honesty, what a despicable comment.Who would have in his place? Someone you won’t be giving out about in a week preferably.
 he’s a see you next Tuesday
Ye guys are celebrating too early.Noonan and Kenny are still sitting TD’sThey will be on the back benches soon with suitcases full of pension and retirement bonus money that we are paying.Sure – I guess when they started out in political life they thought they could make a difference but along the way they forgot about the ordinary people.
Hope he gets a disease.
An evil  man
He is a terrible minister
Fock the 2 if them traitors dock their robbed pensions
Noonan would be due for arrest as per any other working republic… the fact he can be revered my any shows you how many fools are in the state
He is heading off to spend his billi’ns…
horrible
Good riddance!!!. Dont let the door hit u on the way out
-  but also be a party that reaches out and supports vulnerable people. -Meanwhile Leo was manning the “divide the nation hotline” trying to find a few fresh victims !#anyonebutleo
 Fine Gael supports vulnerable like the rope supports the hanging man.
* vulnerable people
 im a blue shirt deep down I suppose but I hope Fine Gael grow a pair and start showing some humility to people. They come across arrogant and completely disconnected from the people they serve. Trouble is theres little alternative whom could govern. Fine Fail? Lest we forget. The Shinners? Two words – Gerry Adams, the independents? Laughable, PBP? They still think their in the UCD students union in the 90s listening to Bono talking sh#te
Presume you mean divide the nation between those who obey the law and those who don’t and cheat on their welfare?
 Its worked on you anyway.
I’m bored with this leadership contest already!
It’s still possible to draw some amusement by observing the other “what’s in it for me” party members. Noonan going out to grass. There’ll be new jobs for the favourite and especially supportive chronies. Can you guess who they are?
Both Simon and Leo both don’t care for those suffering with no homes or needing vital healthcare operations. Anyone who supports either is ok with vulnerable people losing homes & suffering pain waiting for healthcare.
Fine Gael a party for everybody lol.
 funniest thing I’ve heard all day. Bunch of Thatcherites!
 A great party for the wealthy.
None of them have any substantial experience to give to the job other than walking straight out of Uni and on to the podium. So its more years of talk and little action. Whilst Varadka is more ‘ ‘popular’ of course the Bilderberg group will get their man Coveney. But God help us all eitherway – the prize of course is getting that gold-plated pension by default.
“The what’s in it for me?” party. Elbows appointed to senate along with 7 or 8 Enda friends rewarded to an ornament institution
Is it my imagination or do the only ones who care about this are the party faithful and the press? This entire thing seems to a be total non-event, it is as if people have finally copped on to just how irrelevant our politicians really are.
 Not your imagination at all! Most people are pretty apathetic when it comes to politics because nothing ever changes. There is some serious room for a new breed of politician. Revolution anyone?
 It’s a job interview to take over from Enda for a short while and then swap places with Micheál Martin for another while. Very exciting.
Watching rich men fight over who’s gonna control the poor.Let’s call it what it is.Waken up Ireland.
Meanwhile the EARLY MULTIPLE PENSIONS paid to former FAILED politians is ok while the poor are demonised
Are those demonising the poor ok with the former bank regulator on 640,000 + euro lump sum & 140,000 + euro annual pension. He didn’t regulate and that’s his punishment yet those who are disabled or unemployed due to his banking regulating failures are demonised. Who really “cheats us all”? What about failed TDs appointed by Enda & FG & all parties to the UNDEMOCRATIC USELESS & jobs for the boys and girls senate? What about Gilmore Pat Rabbitte on their smoked salmon & champagne “socialists”????? EARLY MULTIPLE PENSIONS? Mary Harney, B.Cowen & Bertie getting a FEWTHOUSAND EVERY WEEK along with the above and other so called socialists yet right wingers here want to rip those who exist on crumbs apart. I despair I really do to what citizens have voted for over and over again
A sham fight between two nonentities for an extra pension at our expense!
Two cheeks of the same arse !
 can say that about all political party members!
The prize for smuggest poster so far goes to Simon, Varadkar better try a different approach because Simon was born and reared to lead FG. Taking over his fathers dail seat must have being difficult for poor Simon and his brothers contacts in our agri-food sector will play no part in getting the blueshirt farmers on board.Minister for finance would suit Leo Varadkar, all them buzz words that mean nothing, sure even Kenny could pretend he knew something about finance.A real leader would just toss a coin and save the nation this embarrassment, can’t be as bad as when labour anointed Joan as leader. A whole two months creating headline distracting peoples attention waiting for there extended summer holidays.
Should be ignored, report the result.all media.
Turd sandwich vs giant douche
2 arch right wingers from a right wing government . Neither please.
Minister for agriculture sold out small farmers on the glas scheme and could not be trusted as quoted by his own tdsAs minister for housing all I can see is the situation getting worseNot Leo’s biggest fan but the better of the two
Simon Coveney hasnt a clue about how real people live…Varadkar makes no apology about it…not in touch with reality at all…..Micheal Martin for taoiseach!
As the article states. Because of the hoola boola around Enda giving up his seat the motion to stop another state company shares sold off has gone through. Bit suss to me. Brown envelopes delivered in the morning ild say.
Two useless ministers with p*ss poor track records want to be the Irish Tory party’s leader – FG are a joke. Coveney on prime time is hilariously insincere – can’t wait to hear the other chancers rhetorical bull$hit!
Simon is the right man
COYBIB
Leo s handlers taking a leaf out of Enda s handlers book keep him away from the media coz his big mouth is bound to put his foot in it
Yesterday I had an opinion on this discussion, today I think you could be living in the US and realise as bad as things are we could be in a far worse situation.
The Bland leading the Bland
Cute Cork Boy Dara Murphy TD is keeping tight lipped..afraid to back the wrong horse!!!
Leo would have something to say about that.???
Who cares whos the leader…hopefully they wont be in power next election…but then again who have to lead….and if anyone suggests SF and Gerry Adams ye can F-off ha ha!
Always liked Leo. Straight talker. Probably won’t be in for long though.
Yawn………..
Lets hope whoever wins leadership race….We get new minister of justice….Justice did not suit her because it means making decisions…Whatever happened to promise to tag criminals on bail…..
 are you a criminal because you are on bail?
OK then lets be a bit more flexible and lenient…. If you have had 50 previous convictions with real victims…. For many people a burglary or an assault is not a trivial crime…Then on the 51st case where you get bail should be electronically tagged…
Frances could not get Noirin’s clearance to go for the leadership role
Will anything change for the whistleblowers soon? She is older than Enda. I’m not ageist but she is probably going to be dropped quicker than respect for whistleblowers by Garda management. She is controversy one after another & so Enda didn’t mind & left her there as he was going for his LUMP SUM & PENSIONS ANYWAY
Bob Hope and No Hope of her getting anywhere near that job. Comparable to Enda for buffoonery.
Enda required seven consultants, Frances Fitzgerald would probably need at least ten.
Good. Shes far too arrogant and condescending to be Taoiseach, and far too inept to be as arrogant and condescending as she is.
 didn’t stop Edna.
At the same time it’s comical watching Heather Humphries blowing smoke up Leo’s arse. And Harris talking up the other lad at as being a great bloke. Coveney must have bribed him with a couple fidget spinners.All about jockeying for better positions along side their respective heroes. Sooner this charade is over the better.
 Haha fidget spinners. I can just imagine Coveney calling him up with the grand plan and Harris tapping his fingers together like Mr Burns.
To much baggage
She is just another member of FG old guard. Her loyalty to Kenny and her ovaries advanced her career over more talented backbenchers within FG. Just like noonan, o’reilly, Bruton and heathers, she can now slider away with a golden handshake worth hundreds of thousands, numerous pensions all not even means tested.Getting rid of the whole rotten shower of kennyites will cost us millions, only for another shower to rise without the country has any say.yet again our future by default are in the hands of two civil war parties who need no mandate just continue on as usual.
 fair play, and thank you, not alot of, actual, honest opinions on here lately.
Heather to become minister for silage!
 I’d say minister for what comes out of a cow rather than what goes into one….
she worse than useless
All fur coat…….
Shouldn’t have lied for her buddy Noirin. It’s cost her dearly.  Stupid stupid ….
 be thankful that she did – it showed her true ‘character’. For someone so desperate to keep liar in Chief Commissioner in place no matter what for fear if O’Sullivan went, she’d be next it’s a good thing we see her as the self-serving snout in the trough she is.
Peter Fitzpatrick for taoiseach.
Political dynasties must stop…
 so you are in support of excluding some people from the political process because of who their parents were?
 I would be anyway.
 Why not?
 I wouldn’t call this a dynasty.
 Not yet maybe , but it is a very disturbing trend in Irish politics .
 I would absolutely be 100% in favour of banning immediate family members from seeking election and holding high offices in the public sector.Over the last decade we’ve seen spouses of TDs be appointed to State boards.And Enda Kenny himself “inherited” his fathers seat.We have a Garda Commissioner who appointed her own husband to a senior position within the Gardai, whose task was to spy of the little folk of this country.In my view, at least for TDs, spouses and children of TDs should be barred from running for public office and sitting on State boards for at least one generation.It is restrictive yes, but the familial cabals have to be broken!
 yes – I am in favour of excluding children of politicians from inheriting their parent’s seats – at least within the same constituency.It is too brown – envelopey.
Sure wasn’t he anointed by the Bilderberg group last year
So again one of two WEATHLY NEPOTISM figures are set to become taoiseach. Each both have the cheek to demonise the poor while both those were born with SILVER SPOON & GOT PRIVATE EDUCATION Simon particularly with the MOST EXPENSIVE EDUCATION & DRAFTED INTO HIS DADDY’S SEAT A BIT LIKE ENDA WHO STAYED IN HIS FATHERS SEAT FOR 42 YEARS & ONLY WENT AFTER THE POOR FROM 2011-16
The route to taoiseach on nothing more than his father’s reputation.
 really doesn’t matter which of them gets the job, neither of them have a clue what its like in the real world.Depressing..
 what was his fathers reputation. Haha
Any chance we could get an article on the innovative policies they’ve implemented or examples where they were presented with a problem, developed and then successfully implemented a solution? Oh sorry this is Irish politics…no need for any of that nonsense!
As a Bilderberg attendee I would say that Coveney is the pick of the elite whose vested intrests lay on “their man” running the country. Leo is not the chosen one and besides can anyone see a gay man being head of FG. It shouldn’t matter as to one’s sexuality when it  comes to their ability to do the job but this doesn’t always ring true in real life.
You can’t say that his sexuality shouldn’t come into it on one hand and then preempt that he won’t get in because of his sexuality.If his sexuality shouldn’t come into it, then stop bringing it up. If it turns out that he doesn’t get it, you’ll have people like yourself saying his sexuality was a reason. You can’t win…
  Your right someones sexuality should not matter about suitability for the job and hopefully it does not become a factor- It should be based on track record of leadership and management of briefs something in my opinion Leo and his campaign of hate has shown none of since he became a minister.The only thing Leo seems to know how to do is spend money on fancy marketing campaigns – cant think why he is the medias favorite#anyonebutleo
 you see that Varadkar has a mayo connection. God help us
 I think though if people are expecting to a bit more ” enlightened ” or liberal because he is gay they could be very disappointed.
I like to see a more indepth look at his performance in government. If he hasn’t performed in housing then where does that leave us if he is running the country? How meaningful is it ? I’m sure there are loads of you out there waiting to enlighten us
FF PULL THE PLUG NOW & DON’T GIVE EITHER OF THESE TWO SILVER SPOONERS A HONEYMOON OR YE WILL BE SECOND FIDDLE TO FG AGAIN
 He is a truly terrible option. The man hasn’t an original thought in his head. He’s nearly worse than Enda which says a lot. He is so obviously media trained it’s ridiculous – he’s virtually impossible to listen to. He’s just another rich farmer taking over Daddy’s crown, Republic my a*se
 Fair enough. I read the 2015 Hot Press interview, no change there.http://www.hotpress.com/Simon-Coveney/features/interviews/Simon-Coveney-Interview/14356299.html
Coveney as another Bilderberg convert will continue to sell off the rest of Irelands remaining assets to his fellow travellers.
Anyone who wants to be a politician should be automatically be banned from being one, a theory from Billy Connolly I happen to agree with.
Don’t know much about his proven track record , but he promised to double the Army Ranger Wing in the aftermath of the Bataclan attacks , nothing happened there .Hasn’t done much on the housing front either , more people homeless than ever before , rents higher than in boom times .
Coveney is a sleeven ! Wouldn’t trust him with the ketchup bottle
Don’t think so, Richard Burton has announced he is not running and is backing Leo
 Bear in mind that a politician said that…
The smug head up on him, another spoofer
 couldn’t of said it better, when he was marine and agriculture minister he made a promise to a certain fishery to cap the number of boats in it as it would become unviable for the fishermen who have been involved in it for decades, but what was done?  fud all full of false promises this fella. Now my jobs future is on the line.
Bilderberg coveney .. well laid plan
It’s safe to say that Coveney never did a days work in his life.
I’ll be honest he has done absolutely nothing for Cork. That isn’t a bad thing for a national politician. Just a rich farmer in a rich farmer party.
Well I was under the impression that people wanted the “keep it in the family” trend to stop. I’m surprised to see some people are happy to see that carry on. Maybe they have something to gain from it!?
Apart from being from a political dynasty and not being good media performer he is good candidate…….He is the FF and SF candidate of choice……Think he is young version of Enda…. While Leo might well bring some change and at least give us new minister for justice….Leo as FG leader might even go on Vincent Browne show…Simon Coveney never would….
 not a political dynasty.
What was his job before he became a TD that allowed him to go on a year long round the world sailing charity event?
Two right wing parasites.watch the mess they leave behind them in gov.neither could run a department competently,let alone a country.
 least right wing is better then being a left winger. Enda found this country in a mess and now we have the fastest growing country in the eu. As well as the fasted growing airport in the eu. That’s says lots if people are willing to trust Ireland
 As a true right winger, he has done absolutely feck all for homelessness,social housing,spiralling rents.And sure why would he?He probably has quite a large property portfolio so  house prices and crippling rents will be quite beneficial to him on a personal level.
 Enda and his side kick Noonan just followed the plan agreed between FF and the Troika. Maybe we should all just vote FF again?
This piece is bordering on propaganda, I was expecting the author to be a FG TD/Senator supporting him.
Simon always strikes me as a guy with permanent PMT.
Great choice! He can use his phrase “there is no silver bullet for this issue” for everything, not just for housing. At least he got great results in solving the housing crisis.
F.G…… fook em all the long the short and the tall…….
Eh…. no
Why there is no female candidate ?
 There can’t be a female candidate just for the sake of it. The only viable option is currently fecking things up in Justice so I wouldn’t like to see her lead the country.
 agree. I think women are capable. But we have a structure in place where men are the dominant in politics.
 Why there is no  single feminist protesting !?
“Thrust onto the political stage”. Really? Like Coughlan and Kenny and… like no other more qualified person than a teacher could possibly look out for their folks?I hope this is the end of old politics and although I don’t like him at all I hope Varadkar wins.
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CbB1UV2WIAAVo-T.jpgLoved by the local community in Cork…
 Installing meters, were they?
Your hatchet job has fallen flat its face,someone must have taken a big punt on Leo,now 1/8 from 1/6Coveney pushed out from 7/2 t0 9/2
 Leo now 1/10Coveney 11/2
I hope not ! He is not even liked in his own County . He has zero charisma and in my opinion is smug and two faced
I thinks a lot of these tds might be needing some medical or psychological help because they’re so delusional about the state of the country!
 Its in much better shape than the opposition lead us to believe. Fastest growing economy in Europe yet again.
  You need to stop watching the FG Pravda TV station.
 of course it is, with leprechaun economics and tax haven status, with no stability, with the fastest swings from boom to bust cause these politicians ain’t got a clue.
 It’s the same across Europe if not the world. All we can do is compare ourselves to other similar countries and on that scale we are doing very well. Greece took an alternative route to us when the crisis hit. How’s that going for them?
 to be clear, you are saying that the Financial Times, the UK press, all the French, German newspapers, CNN etc are all FG-controlled.I had no idea!
 We went from being part of the PIIGS country’s in the EU (that’s the worst 5 out of 27) to being supposedly the fastest, just like that. It’s not realistic economics. There’s a big divide in the country between what official ireland are trying to portray with their manipulated finance figures and what’s reality, which is what most people are experiencing. You just have to see all the protests to realise that. We’re just as bad if not worse than Greece in many respects. They’re a lot more realistic than us. Our gov are faking it.
Soccer T’s  Fastest growing economy in Europe. Keep the recovery going. That’s the daily FG prayer and if it’s said enough they might get another eejit such as yourself to believe it.
How do you explain the 6.2% unemployment rate then? Fake news?
 In my humble opinion people are a lot better off than they were 5+ years ago. My business has seen a positive surge which I also hear from other business people. Employment is up, spending is up. There’s no doubting the continuous issues in housing and health and the need for rural development but that’s nothing new.
 You believe what you want. I’ll believe the independent facts
 while the natural unemployment progression is downwards after any recession, the unemployment rate is driven down more simply to make gov look good. It’s driven down more due to emigration and unemployed moved to schemes. 90k less twentysomethings in the country than 5 years ago, cso figures that are never publicly linked to unemployment figures but have a huge bearing on the figure. In the 1980′s recession, they simply took over 55s  off the unemployment figures and invented a new category called the pre retired, to manipulate the figures. Same leopard, same spots.
 6.2 % not on the live register, where are the then and lets see? Solas/College/Part-time/Back to education schemes/VEC/Employment schemes/seasonal work maybe?
 *6.2 % unemployment, who’s not*
 I’d say that 90k mentioned above is about 2-3 percent unemployment. Manipulating the figures with schemes, another few percent. FG can probably claim for positively reducing unemployment by around 3 percent. On another note, Leo is now showing how utterly useless joan Burton was in SW.
Soccer T’s  Your business is up , then obviously you don’t have to work too hard at it as you’re on here constantly on a daily basis. I ran a business until retirement and I can tell you while I did I would never have had the time to be on social media daily. Are you sure you’re not living in Walter Mitty world.
 Didn’t the say the same with FF blaming them for causing all the countries going into recession.
 You are deluded. This country is a ruin because of Enda Kenny and Fianna Gael.
 This country is is in debt to the tune of 200 billion thanks to Enda and Fianna Gael.
 Its simple. It is lies. People taken off the live register on two bits schemes to pretend they have real jobs. You know damn well these figures are faked. Its the Fianna Gael way and well we know.
 U are beyond idiot. The figures you are spoon fed is Fianna Gael lies and manipulated statistics. Fake.
 Sorry Arian this dumb site f’d up. My comments are meant for the clone Jensen
 Social media is a vital tool in business these days. No disrespect intended but should should probably know that if you were in business. I’ve been on here twice today for 5 mins each time. We also allow ourselves little breaks in the business world these days
 I replied but it was REDACTED like a lot of things in Ireland.CNN etc. get their news from guess who – Pravda RTÉHe who pays the piper plays the tune.
 Yes one would not think that the establishment lifer political classes have socialized a 205 Billion debt onto the citizens, costing 8 Billion pa in interest payment’s,  All is not well in the  rose garden depicted by the political classes, of course Dame Enda will walk out with 376,000 tax free lump sum and 126,000 pension pa.  10 times the pension of the citizens who depend totally on there weekly 235 Euro.   If they received their pension at 65 they would have to live to be  live to 75 to draw down 1 year of Enda’s pension for 1 year and  they would be 96 to draw down Enda’s lump sum.   Some more equal than others in PADDYLAND’S ANIMAL FARM.
How do you explain the 60,000 new jobs created in 2016, majority of which were full time?And by the way, that is twice the job creation rate of the USA.
A recovered society for the few not the many Pascal Donohue. So so many homeless. People living in tents on the Capital’s quays. Kenny oversaw the housing disaster. Hiding behind the perennial excuse of that’s what we inherited is bull. They Fine Gael flogged off large chunks of property to the same vulture funds now evicting our citizenry.Good riddance Kenny
 and how do you propose to solve all these problems?Let me guess vote Sinn Fein, tax the “rich” who earn over 40k at 80% and watch the capital flight begin.
Repeating the same old spoof over and over?Can you link to any proposal from SF involving taxing people on over 40K at 80%?(p.s. try making your spoofs even remotely credible)
The Risen:  Jammin – at least the members of FG get an opportunity to elect a leader unlike the Shinners who have an imposition both in the North and South.
Gerald, Mary Lou and the shinners will probably make Jonathan Dowdall their financial spokesperson to make sure the public pay the 80% tax. He will sanction water boarding for those who don’t. After all Mary Lou proposed him for the council.This will bring a whole new meaning to water charges.
First off not Sinn Fein voter pathetic default attempt on Fine Gael supports when criticized.Second off Fine Gael broke so many promises. Bank recapitalisation, bondholders, healthcare…..People are entitled to criticize your darling Kenny.Thirdly the problem of houseing would have been greatly alleviated if the governement had used Nama housing for the people instead of flogging it off to vulture funds.
 Seriously pathetic Fine Gael supporters don’t take criticism. I am not a Sinn Fein voter/supporter/troll. I am merely pointing out the sad truth, people are living in tents in our city. The housing crisis has got progressively worse during the so called recovery. Selling off blocks of houses cheaply to vulture funds has made this worse.
  should we have sold them off at a higher price to the homeless? I don’t get your logic.
 alphanautica you do understand you just choose to ignore the reality. Getting people out of emergency accomodation and into Nama owned property would have saved the state cash in the long term. Using the property for societal good rather than turning a quick buck.
Mary Lou is a thug . Sinn Fein have a lot of high caliber people.  How can they allow this loud mouth and unprincipled mouth piece to have such a say in the party is inexplicable.
 she’s more of a pig with lipstick who promises the sun moon and stars knowing she’ll never be in power and therefore will never be held accountable.
 Agree here is a person who stood up for republican pedophiles and rapists.
 I’m with you that Sinn Feinn has a lot of caliber. Caliber 45, cal 38, cal 50, 12 gauge. Plenty of history in high calibers for sure
Eh no, he was not a ‘bad” taoiseach. SF are merely sore that for all their bleating, nay saying and crying foul, the country is in a much better position than it was when he took over. While I accept there were elements of “the lucky general” involved too, compare Ireland to SF’s allies in Greece and Venezuela. Would we really have been better off with ‘Jarry’ at the helm? I doubt it.
 kenny was the worse so called leader we ever had, he spent more time out of the country than he did here, the country was in a shambles when fg/lab lied their way to power, so the only way the country could go was up and thanks to the so called opposition ff the recover ? will continue but only for the already have`s not for the dont have`s, between fg/ff/lab what chance does sf stand when no matter what they put forward is shot down by a combination of all three, and do you seriously expect them to go into coalition with a larger party who only want their support to keep them in power ? remember the pd`s and lab….
:  drunk / hungover at the wheel. The reason why no one will go on to power with SF is that no one agrees with their farcial economic policies except themselves, their historical links to terrorism, allegations that rape and paedophelia committed by “republicans” were covered up by senior figures within the party… Do you need any more reasons? Where you see SF, these issues are never far away. They have been in opposition for about 100 years.. Here’s hoping it will be another 100 before they ever get a sniff of power.It’s a cult led by Gerry: why has he never been challenged for the leadership in all these years? Even MLD doesn’t dare to oppose him.
He wasn’t afraid of the responsibility of going into government unlike sinn fein at least, they’re great at spouting from the sidelines
 imagine them in power. They’d have to appoint a justice minister. Oh the irony.
 378k lump sum. fff uuu k me. Bannana republic. hes already 3 or 4 million from salary and expenses. Christ!
 people use the term banana republic a lot. I suspect they’ve no idea what it means.
For the majority in the country Edna has been a disaster. The people on here defending him are the ones who are doing just fine and refuse to recognize that there are hundreds of thousands still suffering from this mans policies.
 or they are being paid to defend him :P
As a Munster man I hope Coveney becomes the next leader of fine gael
  Well anything is better then Leo……Even a Cork man
 As a fellow Munster man I hope Fine Gael will be consigned to the rubbish bin of history where they belong.Coveney and his ilk are players in the Bilderberg group and their attention is not focused on the working people of Ireland or Munster for that matter.If he really represented his province then the major problems of our province would be resolved or at least have a plan for resolving.One major problem in Munster is the lack of a motorway between the 3 main cities outside of Leinster.Another problem is housing in Cork city.
 That’s a great reason! Smh
 So you pick area over qualificats then? That explains politics here all over?
 So qualifications mean nothing?
Can’t beat the ole Socialist Party.. Sorry, Anti Austerity Alliance….. Sorry, Solidarity TD’S spouting there usual sh!te… A party with a whole 3 TD’S… Empty vessels always make the most noise, I’m just surprised that with coppinger with her orange hair and teeth to match wasn’t there holding up a banner of some sort,
 I’m with you that Sinn Feinn has a lot of caliber. Caliber 45, cal 38, cal 50, 12 gauge. Plenty of history in high calibers for sure.
Sinn Fein sticking their knives in. They are used to weapons of all sorts and plenty of practice.
How can we afford to pay him that!? If the country was in a better state then yes!! He shouldn’t take it!!
  we will get half of it back in taxes and USC, never fear…
Brian Cowan did the same for himself when he packed it inGrab the last few sandwiches on the way out “for the journey home “
She should read Enda’s “Contract for the Country” speech out in the Dáil. That would cause a lot of red faces in FG. Or actually maybe it wouldn’t.
Thats an absolute disgrace….he only ever looked after the wealthy and the privileged, his own kind!
Bruton to step up and support Varadkar!
All hail Enda of the 99 pensions ( and the massive goodbye lump sum)Except it won’t be goodbye – he will still sit in the back benches
It feels like the twilight zone Mr Kenny getting more i one month than a lot of people on short time work and  social welfare are getting for  the whole 12 months
 Ah now, it’s not as though his was a full-time job either.
Costing the state approx ,6mil to pay his pension for life….. Sickening
 He is one of many, like Legion in a way lol.
Wonder who will be the next piglet at the trough of the Kenny dynasty.
More lies on top of more lies. FF and FG and a fair few others have done nothing to help the poor people of Ireland. If fact I would go as far as saying all they done was take healthy pay checks for little or no return. When a war comes and it will come I know what side I’ll be on.
Interesting fact the state pension of 220 a week equates to a 300000 pension pot if you were to buy a private anuity
He deserves every cent and more for putting up with the moaning irish since taking office.
 And for kissing Merkel’s rear?
They argue that he should leave for months, and when he finally does all they do is argue! would they ever shit their feckin g0bs
And never to receive another penny from the state #loadofbollox
Small change in comparison to many CEO’s after serving only a few years!
Thanks. I needed a chuckle this morning
And since when has she been Justice Minister?
  Pity, I was hoping for a bridge at the Potin Stil, to take the traffic out of the village. Oh well
After making such a balls as minister of Justice, what a surprise,
 don’t forget her stint as minister for children and youth afairs, another catastrophe of hers.
 I actually think Bruton is the most palatable of them all. He appears competent at least. Simon, I can’t bare to listen to as he’s so media trained and myopic, and Leo is just a shyster without an ounce of substance or sincerity
Surprised she’s not setting up a committee to look into whether she should run or not.
 to report in 2019 !
No surprise there after the mess that is the DOJ. Coventry has done an awful job with the housing crisis and what does Leo actually do anyway? Is this the best Fine Gael can do, really?
  In fairness as least Covney has tried to lead by taking on the difficult brief – Leo cut and ran from Health as soon as he could
 They dont get to choose their briefs. That was Endas job
  so it wasnt Leos fault he didn’t fail Enda moved him?
 He was right Leo has been chasing power since his return from the US – A sinister politician in my opinion#anyonebutleo
What a neck
 She had’nt a hope and she knew it.
 most don’t but there will be deals and handshake all over the place now. You scratch my back etc…..
No loss, hopefully will be replaced in Justice with someone who can actually do the job.
Thank feck for that
Ha! Neither will I now back to work.
Her buddy Noirin saw to that!
 Noirin better get the black bin bags for the shredder ready !
In other news…water is wet
I notice Francis voice has gone up a few octaves in tv interviews ever since her shambolic interview a few months ago. She’s lost her composure. It’s better off she avoids the humiliation she’d get. She’s not capable anyway.
Should go with Kenny as she lies to
Pity….She Really Showed Typical Irish Political Characteristics in recent months
She’s a neck like a jockeys bollox
Lol if she said that it inferred there was a possibility.Is she the worst politician we ever ever had?
It’s a sad day when you can’t call a dimwit a dimwit on the Journal. Becoming more of a Blue Shirt propaganda rag by the day.
 Let me try.Dimwit.
 Oh look the comedian still thinks he’s funny. Sadly he’s the only one!
She has already done enough damage
As if I wanted to know that. Save us from the wallpaper please.
Useless wagon.
So it’s down to the fantasist tool who thinks he’s something like James bond and the very ordinary office worker type fella who has trouble making decisions.
Why are we getting the Frances Fitzgerald article and not the Richard Bruton article ?
This is the wrong article for the headline listed
What a choice ! Covney “A secretive Bildeburger ” or  Varadkar a man who wants to punish people for doing the same thing his own party did for 9 years. At least the tiny amount of ordinary people who are getting paid under the table are doing it to put bread on their table why did Fine Gael do it? and why isnt the media talking about the hypocrisy of Varadkar and Fine Gael with their attack on Fraud?Whoever gets the shameful  job of leading that pack of self-serving gits, won;t be in it for long, their twin party are itching for some more brown envelopes.
 media never stop talking about Leo’s campaign against welfare fraud. RTE, Irish Times, leftie liberals in other media outlets all attacked him but it got zero traction with the silent majority that matters. Claire Byrne Show poll said that 70% supported Leo’s campaign against welfare cheats. You should get off social media and start meeting hard working people who pay their taxes.
Good !!
Slam dunk for Leo. The true blues are back in charge
 both FG true blues and their twin FF need to disappear or 90% of Irish people will be forever slaves of the Banks and corporations. We should show them both the door and adopt the 200 year old Swiss model of democracy.
No he wasn’t .
 Yes he was
Probably his biggest lie and greatest failure was his 2007 election pledge to end the scandal of patients on trollies. In fact he managed to make the health system even worse and spent 10 years blaming it on others. Ongoing neglect and Mickey Mouse patch up jobs came in the form of James Reilly and layabout Leo. In the end he left a sacrificial young lad with his finger in the dam. If you were on the breadline and suffering from serious ill health this man was potentially fatal.
  no he absolutely wasn’t
 that’s your opinion.   Mine is he wasn’t…
 oh No he fcuking wasn’t….
I suppose it you got massive writedowns from banks… Got a deal from Nama,Was a vulture fund with charitable status,   apple,.   Got big government contracts,  etc then you would think he was fantastic.. however if you were someone with disabilities,. Children with health problems waiting on operations, old ,.  Whistleblower    etc then he was useless…
 he left the country in a far better state them when he came to power.
  for who? Are things better for children waiting on operations? No they are still waiting… Are elderly still going cold in winter?  Yes. Are disabilities services still cut? Yes . Are A&E worse now since some where closed? Yes.   Are rural areas still suffering? Yes.. it’s better state all right for some but to suggest it’s everyone is nonsense….
 The Irish people did that themselves.
 did the Bertie ahern lead FF government destroy the country or did the Irish people do that themselves?
He was a moderate leader which is a good thing in this age. Lets others do their job to the best of their knowledge. It’s going to be ongoing struggle to get the health service right, no matter what populist megalomaniac promises otherwise.
@mickmc ..because..??
 In fairness, the country was a very different place in 2007 compared to when he took office in 2011.
 I didn’t say everyone nobody can make things better for everyone but he took over a country that was literally bankrupt and he leaves it as one of the fastest growing economies in Europe.
 So when things go well “the Irish people” did it but when things go bad it’s the politicans fault?
 Let me get this. You say he left the country…… and so on.The country now is worse then ever for the Irish people. The country now for the rich is back to the way it was and why. Because Enda Kenny took all their mistakes and debts and transferred them onto the Irish people. He is a treasonous snake.
 My God are you that stupid. The Irish people did not do that. That is one of the biggest Fianna Gael propaganda’s. The banks bailed out were German and European Banks who threw money at everyone. The banks were bankrupt years before but the lied and cooked the books. That was the banks NOT the people so get your facts right and try not to be a mouthpiece for a propaganda machine. You are regurgitating lies. Try to read and keep us. The people are much more educated as to Fianna Gaels complicity than ye think. It will be your downfall. Do you think we need to hear from Fianna Gael trolls here to know what happened. ha ha Keep thinking we are stupid. The only people voting for Fianna Gael are the old who don’t know any better. As they die Fianna Gael is dying. Bye Bye. Your day is run.
 No No you are mistaken. The populist megalomaniac was Enda trying to get elected and lying through his teeth. Rewind his promises. They were all broken and abandoned the minute he was elected. His EU lapdpog status then begun in earnest.
   he took over a country nearly bankrupt?  He took over a country where banks were nearly bankrupt.. what did he and his government do? Put that debt on the citizens of this country.. stellar job.Fastest growing economy… That depends if you include Leprechaun economics… A good taoiseach would not have made the old , sick and the elderly pay a heavy price for the failings of others.   He did…..
  I believe @Orla Feeney was implying that through the hard work of Irish People, that we are responsible for the very good economic situation in Ireland at the moment. To quote yourself Christopher, “Try to read.”
 you seem fixated on bank debt. But even without that we had a massive and unsustainable current budget deficit. Nothing to do with bankers. That’s what FF left him and leprechaun economics doesn’t account for the rise in employment over the last 6 years. So people just can’t help themselves moaning at every available opportunity.
 fair point. From the pool of such people known as politicians, still think he was pretty balanced and not as corrupt as many before him.
NO he was a joke……………..
 he is a spineless b1tch that wouldn’t give any interviews and screwed every homeowner/ working person in this country and I’ll be glad to see the bank of him and a lot more of them including Joan the moan!
 I take it your one of that other crowd. I wonder how will Paul get on!!
Considering what Biffo left him to start with, i think he did alright.There are a lot of things he did wrong though…
 FG were elected as FF were trying to socialise the potentially illegal bank promissory notes. Under solely FG, with Kenny and Noonan personally responsible, this debt was absorbed and our national debt went from €30b to an unsustainable €210b. This is Kenny’s legacy.
  But what about the recovery…….. History will look back on the last ten years as the worst period in Irish History one which the country will pay for many many years. The  corrupt deals that Noonan and all those in Nama passed onto the shoulders of Irish citizens to pay for the next century.
 Noonan is another kettle of fish altogether, and makes Kenny look like the an empathetic leader who tried to reduce waiting lists, universal health, reduce homelessness (all the things he failed at). Noonans legacy will always be Brid McCole, but he also nationalized the largest debt (per head) in the history of Europe, sold assets to vultures (who did a great job), and cut funding for care (including sarcoma funding – while he had that type of cancer). The best thing that will come out of Kenny retiring will be taking possibly the biggest traitor in Irish history (and that’s being generous) with him.
 Ireland’s national debt was 144.2 billion in 2010 the year before enda was elected under ff Ireland’s debt increased over 100 billion under enda it increased by less than 40 and has dropped 15 in the last 3 years.http://www.ntma.ie/business-areas/funding-and-debt-management/debt-profile/historical-debt/
He wasn’t perfect but we are far better off now than when we started and unless someone has a working crystal ball then nobody can say for sure that anyone else would have done any better
Now roll on a GE and we can get rid of the rest of the what’s in it for me party.
 with unemployment at 6% I predict a FG lead majority government.
 failing unemployment didn’t do it in 2016 and won’t do it next time. Too many other issues.
 The biggest manipulation of fake figures int he history of the state. Lies to keep ye in fodder. We know the truth keep your lies.
 Unemployment was still up and around 9%, they left it too long to try and save Labour so the 2016 election was in the winter, next election will be in the summer meaning the homeless issue is off the radar, and there’s nobody on trollys in the hospitals. Water is now a non-issue. As soon as Coveney has people out of hotels and into proper accomadation, they will call an election. Don’t use the tag line “Keep the recovery going” find something that people like and they will do very very well.The only risk is that FF voters lent their vote to FG, and if they filter back to FF, for stupid traditional reasons. Then, it’ll just be another minority government again.
 Ian, you will be called a Blueshirt and a sheep for talking sense on here ! The bullies are watching you !!
 And replace them with Who? FF?
 how are we better off. All you get is jobs created. What about jobs lost. What are the employment data on those at work such as hours of work rates of pay debt levels and so on
I assume the amarach research team didn’t ask people on trolleys, or the homeless, or whistle blowers. Good riddance ya spoofer.
I actually voted for him the first time he ran for Taoiseach.hospital trolly crisis worse than when elected, homelessness, corruption and cronyism all time high including minister for finance colluding with vulcher funds to pillage this country like they were Viking, no bankers held accountable for financial crisis inspite of Sugarmans offer to inform him, not one but 2 Gardai commissioner scandals, whistleblowers persecuted, water charge debacle, accepting most of eu debt and foisting the austerity on the people, his legacy is lies, half truthes, broken promises and no accountability, oh yeah!  the man in the pub with two pints. Successful leader?If I ran my business as incompetently as he ran this country over the last few yearsI would be out of business by now
 absolute correct jonathan in everything you said although with respect the damage that kenny and this crony’s have inflicted on the people of ireland is a little more serious and longer lasting than a failed business, this man was an incompetent, corrupt clown who lined the wealthy peoples pockets from the empty pockets of the ordinary people, he is a prime example of everything that is wrong with democracy in the world right now and he is a shame to IrelandOn a separate but related note isnt it about time that we legislated to Jail all politicians known to be corrupt and those proven to have lied for their own gain, that would shake things up enough to at least give us a better class of politician and maybe a better country
 Agree completely he devastated the country and his disgusting party.
 the country was deeply devastated before he took over. Wakey wakey time.
Best Taoiseach since Seán Lemass
 a spoofer and a waffler ! Lied he’s way into government and will lie his way out by telling people what a great job he did.  Not another cent that term will follow him to his grave
 Even though Varadkar said it?
 The biggest embarrassment to Ireland since the foundation of the state. A failed teacher cum t shock.
 Don’t sully the memory of Sean Lemass.
He’s not a decent human being,Humans have empathy for disabled children,FG are Sociopaths,The sooner we vote them out the sooner we can start to rebuild this country in a fair and equal way!
 Do you think Fianna Fail are going to do that rebuilding because that are going to be invloved in the next government either way
 The commentator never mentioned Fianna Fail but you just demonstrated in perfect example what Fianna Gael have been doing for years. Deflecting questions and comparing to Fianna Fail. Ye are finished.
 Wishful thinking im afraid , Fianna Fail or Fine Geal will be part of the next government, numbers dont stack up to anything else.
Nothing more than an absolute liar, caughtout time and again. How many times did he meet the man with two pints or the woman on the bus?
Most people on here will say no because they’re effectively anti-government, whoever that may be. It’s easy to jump on that bandwagon but I think he’s done a good job. People will point at some specific examples of where we, as a country, are failing but he brought us out of the recession and that was always going to be tough. I didn’t vote for him first time round but he has won me over. I’m sorry to see him go. I’m sure lots of people will now reel off a selective list of things we need to improve on but you could draw up a similar list of things that have improved since he took office too. Let’s try and keep it balanced.
 100% agree . I think he done the best with what he had. Maybe he is or maybe he is not but he doesn’t strike me as the type of man to line his own pockets like bertie and biffo I think he had Ireland interests at heart no matter how bad his policy’s and decisions looked and I think we will look back favourably in years to come. People have short term memories roll back to 2008 2009 and remember how bad it was. Still a Hugh amount of work needed across all departments especially health but is thst ever going to be where we need it to be? Seems like an impossible area to fix
 point out a few of the things he done well or decisions he made (that weren’t made for him) that helped this country.
 let’s see your list of what has improved then. It will save a lot of time on listing all that has got a lot worse under his ” leadership”!
 as a former FG voter i repeat he was USELESS although maybe not totally to certain privileged people like Noireen o sullivan Denis o brien Angela Merkel etc.
 Are you taking the sight out of peoples eyes. There are thousands of people in Ireland this second suffering because of him. Can you not get this fact. Now in the present not some Utopian future. He made the recession a million times worse. He colluded with those who enforced it. Can you not get this. He expanded and pushed austerity more than the EU. Can you not get this. You get it but you are trying to deflect form people here all down comments who the vast majority know the truth. That Enda Kenny was an abysmal  failure for Ireland but for the rich he was their messiah.
 Thank you for your condescending reply. It reinforces my opinion. I understand that you believe something different, and you are entitled to that opinion as I am to mine, but I feel that the vitriol that pours forth against him is unjustified. Making the recession a million times worse? Seriously? We are coming out of the hardest recession in a decade and are being heralded in some international quarters as an example of how to do it the right way, insofar as it is possible to do it. Can you not get this?
He was USELESS.
As Eamon Dunphy wouĺd say…’A Spoofer!
Stumbled from disaster to calamity. Everything he said felt scripted and false. Surrounded by several advisors and yet enables the likes of Oliver Callan to flourish on the basis of his gaffs. Followed the policy enforced by his predecessors and takes responsibility for its limited success. He has increased the disparity between the haves and the have nots. His tenure enabled the party which destroyed the country for many decades to regain ground in the last election which will probably result in FF becoming the biggest party in the next election. The fact that FF can re-emerge is surely a black mark on Kenny’s reign as leader of FG and Taoiseach.I hope Richard Bruton throws his name into the hat. Both Coveney and Varadkar are proven failures.
He was a proven liar, he was so incompetent he had to start wearing an earpiece so a handler could feed him answers to such complex problems what’s your name, your age and the class your in.Inherited his seat, spent 30 odd years asleep in the Dail, became FG leader after Hep C Noonan lead it to electoral decimation and only became taoiseach after FF ran the economy in to the ground. Then followed the deal agreed between FF and the IMF, except he didn’t go after the boys in Kings Inn, the sick, the poor and carers, he went after them though.
Best in a long time, but the standard set by the last 5 or 6 was very low. The country is in a much better place than it was in 2011 which was partially down to him and his appointments, but mostly down to the Irish people working hard and digging ourselves out of the mire that we were in, so we did flatter him a hit. But to be fair, he kept the corporate tax rate as is despite pressure. He was a bit pigheaded, even when he was completely in the wrong and should have gone at least 6 months ago.
 And into the economic mire we will go again.  House prices rising at 10%+ wages and salaries rising at best 4% before tax, and levies, same scenario as before the crash, interest rates at zero only way is up, Brexit  and Trumpism are big danger’s to our economic growth.  Wages again chasing cost’s, Car insurance has doubled in the last 3 years,  Hotels Restaurant’s going back to Celtic tiger prices,  Property tax, ? of water tax.  When will the Irish ever learn,they keep electing the same old lifer’s to Dail Eireann and expect radical change , aint going to happen leopards do not change their spot’s.
There was no alternative not one who would have done better. All parties would have done the same. Bar sinn fein whom would have ruined our country even more so. In fairness to Kenny I think he done as best as he could considering what he inherited from FF. He may have sold the country to Germany but I truly belive the alternative was worse
 selling to Germany (bit dramatic but I get your meaning) was probably don’t around late 2010. The handshake and transaction was done by Cowan, Enda sent the logbook. Like you said, he did the best with what he had.
 probably done, not don’t. Spellchecker doing its thing.
 Don’t waste you time. he is a liar we all know it and we all know the damage done. Ye will pay the next election.
From the day he took over the so called running of the state there was lie after lie, yes they can claim they brought in equal rights for the lgbt community but let’s give the people of Ireland this credit, we have seen the worst housing crisis, a horrible hospital crisis, motor insurance company calling the shots on pricing cost of living going up peoples wages going down, we can all ad to the list.
Just shows how tough a job it is. Some people really need to manage their expectations. Very happy with where we are now from when he started
 typical Gaeler very happy with rampant corruption in AGS, very happy a special needs girl was left to be repeatedly raped in a foster home, very happy Dennis “Moriarty Won’t be left in a shelf” O’Brien made millions thanks to  FG, very happy with rampant corruption in AGS. the thanks for our economic isn’t down to the leprechaun economics  of FG but the plan signed between the ffailures and the IMF.
 Of course you are happy. Rich and well off are we. Fianna Gael are natzi’s/ Ye targeted the most vulnerable in society over the rich. We won’t forget. You and your ilk will pay for turning on the Irish people in favour or money.
 if you’re going to insult someone. At least learn how to spell the insult. And learn what the source of the insult stood for rather than just flinging it around.
All he cares about is FG and his legacy. Nothing else comes close.
Say goodbye to the old Boss.New Boss will be the same.Deja vu.Status quo.Etc etc.

He was caught out lying on a number of occassions on the Dail record plus 90% of the rest of the time he danced around the big questions and dodged taking action on lots of the big issues
 and terrified of Vincent Browne.
No one need worry that your preferred choice from North of the border will never ever be Taoiseach.Now that Enda has stepped down you and your shinner mates will start knocking and ridiculing the next Taoiseach before he’s even appointed. Don’t forget to have a go at FF and Lab while your at it.Enda was not a great leader but he was Taoiseach if our country and unlike you I respect that office.
 Clarification. You mention shinner. Let me put this to you. Thousands here are not shinners and yet we still know Fianna Gael and Kenny were the worst since the foundation of the state. No need to deflect to Sinn Fein. You sound desperate. You know the end is in sight.
He should never be forgiven for his, “The Irish people went stark raving bonkers’ remark when explaining to Europe the crash in the economy. The Crash that was caused by inept politicians like himself.
 And he also said we all went mad when he was at Davos. I personally will never forget this. I felt totally and uttely betrayed as someone who worked all their lives and paid my taxes. This was the most treasonous comment any leader even said in public. Imagine if an American President or leader in any other country said this about their citizens. He would be removed immediately, This comment proved to me there and then he was just a puppet for the EU.
 and his crockadile tears for the weomen in the Magdalen Laundries.
Another career politician retires with his pensions ,never had to struggle in his life for food ,money ,Belongs to a party where poor health service , suicide , emigration ,low paying jobs ,homelessness are the side effects of his parties policy ,Good riddance
He was our Alexander, our Augustus. The archetype philosopher king: bold, wise, daring, dashing, inspirational. And at least seven feet tall.
 Medication time…..
 i think Lorcain needs to see somebody quickly -Fine Gael the party who want to see all workers barely above the minimum wage like an army of ants supplying the Queen bees at the top with riches and special privileges.
At a time when we most needed a leader to stand up for our interests, the Troika got the best ally it could imagine. Kenny was always steadfast and brave in taking on the small people, both individually and collectively, but was seldom to be found when we needed to stand up to the big people, unless he was standing beside them. He chose the easier route of imposing further austerity on our people rather than perusing our ” special case” in Europe. We were subsequently informed that we would not be re-capitalised as austerity had been so successful. Given the impact of austerity on this and future generations, this is a gross act of national betrayal. Had Kenny stood up to other interests with the same vigour that he fought his people into submission, his legacy might truly been great.
He should never be forgiven for his, “The Irish people went stark-raving bonkers” remark when explaining the crash in Europe. A crash that was caused by inept politicians like himself.
A vile vermin corporate gov
A complete waste of space, oxygen, and a charlatan. Good riddance to him!!!!!
Kenny the man who said he he would do a report card on each ministers performance every 6months, it never happened, well when I think of Frances Fitzgerald I can see why this was another spoof of his.
Brillunt
He still looks very fresh. He mustn’t have worked long enough. I’m a bit disappointed he wimped out so easily without a fight unlike Charley. Time for more golf Enda. Enjoy.
All for him self
Eh no.
Absolutely not!
Yeah I’m split too. Cant make up my mind whether to describe him as useless, ignorant, cowardly, dishonest, obnoxious, devious, insincere or a complete bull shitter. Him and his 5 point plan and his contract for government lies. He sold out the good people of this country to the banks and our tax masters in Europe. The assets of this country have been stripped bare and given  to his friends and buddies in Nama, Redacted, etc. An absolute disgrace, cheered on by his sidekicks including Noonan, Varadakar, Coveney and Hogan. Scary the amount of corruption and connivery going on at high levels in this country at the moment.
Popular with the wealthy, FG will always be.
Good riddance to this obnoxious man.
That’s an amazing poll result.  Almost half the people in Ireland say he was good?  Wow.  Judging by the negative V positive comments here, the positive feeling towards him is a lot less than 40%. As a leader, he was nowhere to be seen when it mattered. He lied to the electorate on many occasions, particularly in his promises to deal with the bond holders.  And his willingness to throw others under the bus gives a measure of the sort of man he is. Good riddance.
Horrific and abhorrent worst taoiseach in the history Ireland. Had he not stood over the scandals and corruption that didn’t need to happen we’d be singing his praises.
Why do people continually ignore the fact that it was Fianna Fail’s policies of recovery Fine Gael were implementing? Why do people also ignore the fact that after 6 years of blaming Fianna Fail for everything, Fine Gael brought Fianna Fail back into the fold so Enda could complete his personal ambition of becoming the first Fine Gael Taoiseach to serve consecutive terms?We really are a nation of idiots, no wonder the political class take full advantage of our collective stupidity.
 Get it into your head we don’t ignore it but Enda Kenny outdid them. Get it.
A very good Taoiseach.
 go back to bed Kerry and have a good sleep for yourself.
As a mayo man, I am delighted to see ends go, from water charge, property tax, bin collection, this is what he left us, did not burn the bond holders,
Well his own party colleagues didn’t think he was good enough for the job so there’s your answer.
He was crapp ..he was a yes man for the EEC anybody not notice that …he certainly was not for the people
No, a dreadful taoiseach
Now imagine that. In a Fianna Gael majority contributor site all they squeeze out is forty per cent. Are the Fianna Gael trolls here so trying to say that 60 per cent are so stupid that they  do not appreciate Enda as was suggested?? No. Let me pose another scenario. The 60 per cent are those who have had their lives impacted so badly by Kenny and Fianna Gael that it is impossible to see him as any other than a complete idiot and his government favoured the extremely privileged as insisted by Angela Merkel and the EU masters who kenny bowed down to. Kenny only demonstrated to the Irish people that he was a liar. He broke all his promises and continued the disastrous policies of Fianna Gael and the dictates of the Troika above and beyond the call of duty to the point of even asserting that they would never even ask for a write down for the people of Ireland. He willfully took the debts from the super wealthy and placed it on the Irish people. 70 Billion Euro on the people he said he would protect. Noonan went further and made sure this was enshrined as sovereign debt so that we could never get rid of it. Enda Kenny turned his back on this country and the Irish people in favour of EU elites and he did their bidding to the extreme. Thousands of people in Ireland are suffering and dying directly because of the choices his government made. This country is not back to where it was FOR THE RICH. The Irish people will not forget this. Don’t insult us asking who we want for the next Gael leader You may as well ask who we would like to succeed Hitler for all the good it will do.
I wonder what people’s opinion would be if there hadn’t been 10 years of media bias against him… #justsaying
 That is the biggest most blatant comical lie I have read. RTE and the media were his own private poster boys.
I dont like his politics but one should not underestimate his senior position in the political grouping in Europe that FG and the CDU both belong to. Kenny gave comfort to the Germans that Ireland were team players whether you agree with that or not I think it allowed us some leeway not afforded the likes of Greece.
No
He was a terrible Taoisach
Very poor. Little better than Bertie.
He did a great job….if you are german
H
No he was a brown noser for Merkel & was every bit as bad as FF for appointing his cronies to well paid & powerful positions. No loss to the country. A weak leader
Anyone know what this ” data in wrong format” message means when trying to post here????
 this posts but it seems any criticism of Kenny is ” wrong data”!!!
 The top 300 rich list elites are very happy with Kenny and co. Their combined wealth has increased 69% from €50 billion to €84.4 Billion since 2010.All at a time of severe austerity for everyone else but most disgustingly for the frail, disabled and homeless.
No. A traitor.
Enda and his merry cabinet colleagues missed a great opportunity to be remembered as the government who rewrote the political handbook for Irish Politics.
Pros and cons both ways.  But he had the balls to launch a blistering attack on the Vatican over the Cloyne Report.  For that alone he deserves applause.
He was and he wasn’t. Everything doesn’t have to be black and white.
Yes he was.he can walk away with no scandal on his record so he can!He has done an awful lot to get us out of the horrible mess bertie and his gang got us into.Yeah,we always liked a jack the lad didnt we?And look where it got us.He deserves a good retirement,he earned it.
The devil and Merkel thought he was???
The worst one we ever had
It doesn’t matter who leads fine gael. It doesn’t matter who wins the election. The banks tell the “leadership” what to do.
Yes he was
No a muppet
Fair play to him.  He got the job deep in the recession and stuck at it.
Like a puppet on a string.
 Even after getting the German government to do 8 of our budgets and also taking on German debt on top?
 the German government reviews the budget of every EU Member State.
 “A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.” Lao Tzu.For the slow learners, this means:If he screws up completely, the naysayers will rightly blame him.If he does a good job, the naysayers will try to deny it was a good job, and point to false data.If he does such a good job that it is completely undeniable that a good job was done, the best the naysayers will be able to come with will be that the good result happened without his intervention, and that someone else did it. By hiding in hypotheticals, the naysayers can gain comfort in their uninformed viewsJack, it’s like this quote was written for you.
 That he did. And he made very sure no banker, bondholder, EU blackmailers, failed developers, Dobby, vultures, cronies etc were harmed in the making of the “recovery”.Everyone else were harmed, pauperised, and some were driven to suicide.That’s the reality.
 gormless traitor, sold the country out!
 He agreed to place debts onto your kids for many years to come, what a legacy.
It is easy as a leader to be popular by buying public sector votes and spending borrowed money on services. That can only be sustained for short periods.When the crash happens, a leader has to step up, make some very hard decisions that he knows will lose votes for his party, but will turn around the economy.Thanks Enda, Fine Gael.No doubt the next govt will be FF, the voters have short memories, already unions sensing the economy is improving, are making the demands to return to 2008, forgetting that the salary levels of 2008 were unsustainable.Let us hope that the next govt dont repeat the mistakes of the recent past.
 But they did ours like a parent who did the childs homework for them. They do review our budgets NOW.
All the corruption inquiries he left behind him,the poverty he forced family’s into,helped by labour party,the majority are grateful the pressure they kept on eventually forced enda Kenny from office.
 Very dramatic but maybe he just retired?
 I’m not saying he did a fantastic job but Ireland was in the middle of the worst recession of our era, he didn’t exactly have billions to play around with. Fianna Fail had committed the Irish citizens to paying off the bankers debt and Enda was left with the mess that unfolded. He didn’t do spectacular by any means but I doubt any of the parties would have magically solved our problems during those/these times, all would have forced the charges and cuts on us.
It’s all a “game” to these “big” party politicians, and when their guard is down, they reveal this ugly fact. Attention-seeking Power-junkies is a very dangerous personality type.
One of the best we’ve had.
 At?
 In time we will look back at Enda,s reign, and will still think he’s an idiot.
 F.G. F.F. and Liebour will be seen as a bunch of idiots?“We want nothing to do with the backward looking idea of Sovereignty.We remain absolutely committed to the ideals of the European Union.We see the Union for what it is, the most successful international organisation in world history.” Michael Martin Dail 11/05/17
 whatever you think of the politicians the EU has been fantastic for Ireland. We have gained so much
 one of the best what?
 Says the West Cork Fisherman………. Not! I agree tho Dave EU has been great for the nation.
 True… But not much competition in recent years anyway.
 one if the best? If that is true then Ireland is compketely fuc*ed
despite whatever various persons feel about him and political sides, ultimately he will he judged by the economy he inherited and the economy he left with. Not a shabby tenure.
 Yup he inherited a right mess economically, I know ppl complain and te problems we have still but its mainly a hangover of what the FF gov. mess. It will take time to fix another 5 years min, however on political reform and institutional accountability he promised but nothing was achieved, too long in the tooth I think too many yrs in the dail and too conservative. I have to admit I could never stand to hear him talk he always sounded like a school teacher. He was a better Taoiseach than I thought he would be, I think in history he will be remembered for the turnaround in the economy the rest and bad of his tenure will fade away most likely.
 Economies travel in cycles regardless of what the government does so I wouldn’t give too much credit!
Seven consultants just shed a tear.
 “Let the games begin” that says it all, it’s all just a big game to them, they’re just playing with people’s lives, livelihoods and homes like they’re playing government monopoly.
Wounder what his next stop will be on the gravey train.
 Merkel’s Secret garden, she needs someone in the EU to trim her bush…
Anywhere else this numpty would’ve remained a teacher.lucky escape for a lot of kids
 at least you don’t have to be an ex-Eton Oxbridge graduate. I can see how serving the needs of children and the wider community can prepare you for a life of public service
Hopefully the new leadership contest will rip the heart out of the party and Fine Gael will explode from a severe case of political ebola.
 Who will you vote for Jack?
Adams even used this to score political points – ‘came in with a crisis & went out with a crisis’. What will they say about you Gerry ? Will they be as nice about you as they were about Martin?
Gone,,, Like a scalded cat ;-)
Hopefully, he’ll take his beloved Mary Louise O’Waffler with him
A great leader and an inspiration to the nation – if only we ever found one of them.
And the beatification of Saint Enda of the 99 pensions has started.
On your bike muppet
 Saddle sores for everyone now…
“Mind if I go and cash in my pensions”Evil smirk emoji
Sure he was heading to the pub to meet the man with two pints…..
Did I read somewhere that he’d renounced his lump sum and pension from his long teaching career(4 yrs)..thought not..

This is nothing more than FG spin. Ignoring all the crisis and protests and dysfunctional economy, claiming themselves a big success regardless, RTE unfortunately adding to the spin, making it somehow dramatic. Unfortunately some people are being fooled by it.
History is not going to be kind to Kenny.  He did take over in the greatest financial crisis in the Republic’s history, but how he and his government went about dealing with that was neither competent enough, fair enough or transparent enough.  Kenny’s legacy would have been relatively better the shorter the length of his being Taoiseach.  He leaves up to his eyes in controversies, with a leadership campaign going on in full public view for several months in FG, FG’s frontbench looking increasingly threadbare and his government propped up by FF in a way that makes a mockery of the supposed Dail parliamentary system.
“It is morally wrong, unjust and unfair to tax a persons home”- Enda Kenny, 1994
Enda an era.
History will judge enda .under his leadership  7,000 irish citizen s became homeless 2;000.of them are children. He said he would  end hospital waiting lists and people on trolleys instead the health serve has gotten a lot  worse. 2 yrs to see a specialist. More people  employed .more people  were forced to emergrate or on scheme s .gardai .scandals water charges .he started so well telling  off the church about  sex abuse he inherited a bankrupt state  but he brought people to there knees in order to  look good to his good friends in Europe..enda in his ivory ….
No doubt ML O’Donnell will be on the RTE airwaves and anywhere prepared to entertain her in the coming days with her stomach-churning waffle about her beloved leader, how he plucked her from nowhere like a prince choosing his princess.
The Enda Days, a Doomsday film by FG.
I think its quite clear that some of these “emotional” tds might need some medical help they’re so deluded about the state of the country.
In fairness Enda was the leader through the biggest economic crisis of the history of the state, Shane on Gerry Adams trying to score political points about the very crisis created by lazy bankers and people living on credit cards when him and Mary Lou fly to New York first class to collect cheques from Donald Trump (90s) and the big wigs in the US.
Is it a bird, is it a plane… NO! It’s Enda leaving lol.
Will be best remembered for his reign over corruption, cronyism ,made the rich super Rich crushed the less well off and sold us out
What a deluded bunch! It’s like keep all the crisis and protests out of minds and we’ll claim ourselves a big success.
In all fairness it’s the Eu pulling the strings, coveney or varadkar will not be much better.
Don’t worry enda there’s a good job waiting for you in Brussels you useless piece of crap
Seeing this moron leave makes me feel like I’ve taken a massive dump after years of constipation. #endathenightmare
 graham, thats the quote of the year! I know exactly what you mean.
Edna the accidental leader of our country,The country pumpkin village idiot type like so many other TD that inherited their seat from daddy. A man untill recently held on to his teaching job, In affect blocking someone who wants to teach from gaining a full time job just like many other TD. While a jnr minister who also drawed down on the ministers pension while also collecting a TD wage, A man who refused to do interviews with certain media personal, Someone that mumbles and cannot speak coherent that they use a certain comms company chairperson son for speaking lessons. Then the army out on the street protecting the ATM and lads with 2 pints in their hand.
 the ATM debacle. All that had to be done by the banks was to turn off the ATMs. What a bullshitter
I suppose he will be on Vincent Brownes programme sometime soon, hope he brings his famous earpiece, someone has
