IN SOME PICTURES, there are cuts across her face. In others, she has a black eye, or appears to be in the middle of being arrested by the police. Headlines imply that the TV presenter has been prosecuted, exiled, or publically disgraced.
There’s a good chance you’ve seen these ads.
Statistics that Meta provides for the EU show that the profile spreading these posts about a famous TV presenter has had posts promoted into people’s Facebook and Instagram feeds hundreds of thousands of times.
The account is “verified” – as that of an Indian politician who is currently on trial forcorruption charges- though the ad library of Facebook’s parent company, Meta, shows that the profile is managed by people from Bangladesh, Belgium, Estonia and Vietnam.
The Journalunderstands the account was compromised by hackers who launched more than 50 ad campaigns. Many of these have since been removed for breaching Meta’s advertising standards.
All of the more than a dozen remaining ads on that account feature photos of a badly injured woman purported to be RTÉ presenter Maura Derrane. All these posts are pure fabrications.
Another example shows what appears to be a screenshot of the Irish Independent featuring an image of two Gardaí restraining a woman whose face is blurred. “The charges against Maura Derrane have been confirmed,” the false headline reads.
The headline was never published in the Irish Independent and the image of the woman being arrested was taken at an Extinction Rebellion protest. The original, high-quality image clearly shows that the woman is not Derrane, and photos of injuries do not appear elsewhere and have been doctored.
In response toThe Journal’squeries, which included a relevant Ad Library ID, Meta said that the promoted posts have since been taken down for violating their standards.
A sample of one of the ads on Instagram
Derrane is not the only Irish celebrity to feature in such scam ads, and Facebook and Instagram are not the only platforms that they appear on.
The ads, which usually falsely claim that a well-known Irish figure has accidentally revealed a quick way to make money involving cryptocurrency platforms, have featured politicians such as Leo Varadkar, Micheál Martin and Enda Kenny, as well as television presenters such as Ryan Tubridy, Colette Fitzpatrick, Ciara Doherty, Brian Dowling, and Alan Hughes.
The Journalhas previously debunked hoax ads featuring images of political strategistAlastair Campbellon the Late Late Show with Patrick Kielty; a fake interview ofEamon Ryanon the Tommy Tiernan Show; fake photos of presenterTommy Bowebeing escorted by PSNI officers; and fakeAI-generated videosfeaturing Elon Musk and Irish BBC newsreader Tadhg Enright.
We have also debunked scam ads featuring newsreaderAnne Doyle, who has again featured in recent scam videos advertised on YouTube that three readers reported toThe Journal.
These ads usually suggest that the celebrities involved had done something illegal, embarrassing, or scandalous.
“BREAKING NEWS: Allegations against Brian Dowling confirmed!”, one post on Facebook reads, next to what appears to be an image of the TV presenter dressed in a prisoner’s uniform with a law enforcement agent behind him. The story and image are fake — Dowling’s face was digitally added toa photo of a baseball pitcherwho served time in a California prison for possession of cocaine.
Micheál Martin, who late last year resolvedHigh Court proceedingsagainst Google seeking information about who was behind “fake adverts” he says were used to defame him, still appears in numerous fake ads for scams, which are currently prevalent on Twitter/X.
“The scandal erupted during a live broadcast when Micheál Martin accidentally revealed his secret on the programme,” a hoax article promoted on social media begins.
It goes on to falsely claim that Martin is being sued by the Bank of Ireland after he “became enraged” and revealed he made money from a cryptocurrency platform live on TV.
There is a typical formula for stories promoting these scams, and Martin is far from the only instance of a story claiming that a celebrity was being sued for revealing a secret money-making platform.
“Scammers may pretend to be a celebrity advertising crypto on social media or a reputable website,” the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) toldThe Journal.
“The ad will promise their followers high returns on their investment. For example, asking their followers to take part in a giveaway scheme for free cryptocurrency.
“Cryptocurrencies are unregulated, which means that no central bank guarantees them or controls their supply, and this could perhaps be a reason why cryptocurrencies are a popular choice for scammers.”
About one in five people have experienced some form of fraud, according to survey results the CCPC shared withThe Journal.
A series of scam ads promoted by verified accounts on Twitter claimed that Alastair Campbell was being sued by the Bank of Ireland (both the bank and Campbell confirmed toThe Journalthat this was not true), who also supposedly shut down a broadcast of the Tommy Tiernan show in which he interviewed Eamon Ryan.
In both cases, the Bank of Ireland was supposedly trying to suppress knowledge of a crypto scheme from being released to the public.
The Bank of Ireland is a private bank and its supposed actions make little sense in these stories. It’s possible the scammers behind these fake stories are confusing it with the Central Bank of Ireland, which does have abroader remitto protect the public interest.
This is just one clue that those running these scams are not based in Ireland, along with a lack of understanding of the characters featured in the stories, nonsensical English, and details that would jar with Irish readers, such as the Californian prison and law enforcement uniforms that appeared in the fake story about Dowling.
Clicking on these scam ads can be a disconcerting experience. In part because the reader is often taken to a clone of a real, well-known website, reformatted to push software that promises to make them rich.
Most of the time, the site is an almost exact replica of a news outlet, such as Forbes, RTÉ or the Irish Independent. Often, these sites carry the bylines of real journalists who work for these outlets, falsely implying they had written the articles.
Sometimes, though, the link keeps redirecting the page, bouncing through different URLs until eventually landing on a URL that sometimes doesn’t even feature the fake news story that the social media ad promised — instead of a sportstar getting arrested, it tells the tale of a newscaster being fired.
Leave the page open long enough and sometimes it will change in real-time, turning from a cloned news site into what appears to be an online electronics store.
These quirks may all be an effort to avoid being detected or banned — it’s hard for a social media platform to block a target URL if it can’t figure out what it is, and content moderators who see a different page than what was described by a concerned user are likely to assume a mistake was made in the report.
Meta has policies againstsensational contentand restrictions onpromoting cryptocurrencyin their ads.
Facebook has furtherCommunity Standardsthat prohibit content that “purposefully intends to deceive, willfully misrepresent or otherwise exploit others for money or property”.
However, in the past it has taken legal action for the company toadmit wrongdoing, such as last December when they admitted in Dublin court that “several false, misleading and defamatory advertisements” promoting a cryptocurrency auto-trading program were published about Qatari businessman and ex-husband of Janet Jackson, Wissam al Mana.
“Protecting users is our top priority,” a Google spokesperson toldThe Journal. “We have strict policies that govern the kinds of ads that we allow to run on our platform and we invest heavily in the enforcement of our policies through a combination of human reviews and automated systems.
“We continue to invest significant resources to stop bad actors and we are constantly evaluating and updating our policies and improving our technology to keep our users safe.”
The Journalalso inquired about the ads that have recently appeared on its platform.
“We are currently reviewing these ads and if we find any ads that breach our policies, we’ll take appropriate action,” they responded.X.com did not respond toThe Journal’semail, as appears to be its approach to all media inquiries. However, its website claimsthey prohibitfraudulent and deceptive content, including the use of “clickbait tactics” and misleading claims in advertisements.
The policy does not appear to be effectively enforced.
As a test,The Journalwas able to find such celebrity scam ads on Facebook and X.com in less than a minute, just by scrolling through the main feeds of these sites.
An attempt to find scam ads by clicking on random YouTube videos did not yield similar immediate results.
During these informal tests, the celebrity most frequently featured in the scams promoted by verified accounts on X.com, other than Micheál Martin, was the site’s owner, Elon Musk.
International coverage of similar scams indicates that the same process has been in operationfor yearsand has targeted countries acrossthe globe, often usinglocalcelebritiesthat have supposedly been arrested, fired or disgraced, accompanied by fake images.
In February, Ireland’s media regulator, Coimisiún na Meán, opened a contact centre where illegal activity can be reported. However of the 150 contacts that Coimisiún na Meán has received, none of them were related to online fraud or scams, they said.
“Under the Digital Services Act, online platforms are obliged to act on illegal content when they become aware of it,” Coimisiún na Meán toldThe Journal.
“If users believe that a scam ad is illegal content, they should report it to the platform where they see it.
“If the platform does not take action on this content, the user can make a complaint to the Coimisiún na Meán contact centre by calling + 353 1 963 7755 from Monday to Friday, 8am – 6pm or by emailing usersupport@cnam.ie.”

FORMER TAOISEACH ENDA Kenny has been diagnosed with cancer but is expected to make a full recovery.
It is understood that Kenny underwent an operation in recent months but is now recuperating.
A spokesperson for the former Mayo TD said Kenny does not wish to comment further on the illness.
Kenny served 42 years in politics, and six of those as Taoiseach, before resigning in 2017.
In recent years, he has taken up the position on the board of thepublic relationsand lobbying firm Heneghan Strategic Communications.
He also fronted an Irish language television series on RTÉ about oldIrish railway routes.
Since leaving office, the Mayo TD also formed part of a winning crewwith Bear Grylls’at a charity royal regatta in 2019.
ENDA KENNY TURNS 71 today.
The former Fine Gael leader was Ireland’s 13th Taoiseach, holding that office for just over six years from 2011-2017. How much can you remember about him?

FORMER TAOISEACH ENDA Kenny has landed a new position on the board of the public relations and lobbying firm Heneghan Strategic Communications.
Kenny, who was Taoiseach for more than six years before resigning in 2017, will serve as a non-executive director when he joins the board next month.
The Fine Gael-linked firm says he will provide guidance on its “future strategic direction”.
Heneghan provides consultancy in corporate communications, financial communications, public affairs, crisis communications and digital communications.
Its clients include National Broadband Ireland (which is delivering the National Broadband Plan), the media agency MediaCom, the Irish SME Association (ISME), SSE Renewables and Cork University Hospital.
The company was founded by Pat Heneghan, who was a long time advisor to former Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader Dr Garret FitzGerald.
Its Director of Public Affairs, Eoghan Ó Neachtain, previously served as government press secretary during the first year of Kenny’s term as Taoiseach, having been appointed to the job under the preceding Fianna Fáil-led government.
In a statement Kenny said he has “known Heneghan Strategic Communications for many years”.
“I look forward to supporting a dynamic team with an ambitious vision for the future of the company,” he added.
The firm’s managing director, Nigel Heneghan, said he is “honoured” that the former Taoiseach has agreed to join the board.
FORMER TAOISEACH ENDA Kenny has said the golfgate controversy is “in the past” and that it is tme to “move on” from what happened.
Speakingon The Late Late Showlast night, Kenny said that “lessons were learned by everybody” from what happened..
Last August, the Oireachtas Golf Society organised an outing in Clifden at which members and invitees played golf before a dinner in the Station House Hotel.
A total of 81 people attended a dinner in a room in the hotel despite Covid-19 regulations not permitting such gatherings, with a partition erected to divide the room.
Among those who attended the golfgate dinner were then minister Dara Calleary, then EU commissioner Phil Hogan, Supreme Court judge Séamus Woulfe, former RTÉ presenter Sean O’Rourke.
Kenny played golf as part of the event but did not attend the dinner.
Speaking last night, Kenny said that he told the organisers in advance that he would not be attending the dinner.
Asked about the reaction to the event and the outcry from it, Kenny says he has “put it all out of my mind”.
“It’s all past and dealt with, I’m moving onto a different plane now.”
Pushed on the issue further by host Ryan Tubridy, Kenny said it wasn’t necessarily about the issue going away because it didn’t concern him.
“I told them in advance I would not be there but the mood was was such that that was the outcome. But that’s in the past now, that’s a lesson learned by everybody, move on.”

Kenny also spoke about his retirement from politics ahead of last year’s general election, having first been elected 45 years before that.
He said that he felt that it was not his role to comment on current political events. A former teacher, Kenny was asked about the government’s decision to move to an aged-based priority modelfor the vaccination of most of the country.
Kenny said it was not for him to comment on the decision but that it’s about “vaccinating all our population and getting on with the job as quickly as we can”.
No presidential ambitions
The former Fine Gael leader has also been suggested as a potential presidential candidate but when this was put to him he said he would not be interested in the role.
“I used to enjoy visiting both President McAleese and President Ó hÚigín, President Higgins in Áras an Úachtaráin because you have to go there to give them an update on events in the house.
Asked does he have any political regrets, Kenny said he was “far from being perfect” but he does not have any regrets.
He said that his focus in government was to “move the economy” from where it was and to “restore respect” for the country and give it “financial integrity”.
Asked whether years of austerity budgets under the EU-IMF Troika had shouldered austerity onto a generational and widened inequality, Kenny said:
“I’d love to have been able to do so much more to eliminate poverty, to have greater equality to deal with the issues about all of those things that you mentioned, of course. But you’re not going to be able to do any of that unless you have a country that’s stable, that’s able to generate capacity to do those things.”
FORMER TAOISEACH ENDA Kenny is set to front an Irish language television series on RTÉ about old Irish railway routes.
The series is being produced by Sonas Productions and will air in late 2021.
A fluent Irish speaker, Kenny will host the series in the native language.
Funding is being made available for the series through the Irish Language Broadcasting Fund.
In the series, Kenny will visit old railway routes throughout Ireland, learning the history of them.
In a statement, RTÉ said: “Enda Kenny journeys along the lost railway routes of Ireland, learning the history of the route and meeting some of the local communities along the way.”
Kenny served as leader of Fine Gael from 2002 to 2017 and as Taoiseach from 2011 to 2017.
WHILE THERE’S NO new government formed yet, that doesn’t stop the Dáil from having a row every now and again.
Today, disagreement emerged between members over the deletion of the Guerin report from the Oireachtas Library.
A motion to withdraw the report by barrister Sean Guerin into garda misconduct allegations by the whistleblower Maurice McCabe was due to be tabled in the Dáil this Thursday on foot of a Supreme Court judgment last year.
The Guerin report hadfound that former Justice Minister Alan Shatter had failed in his dutiesto properly investigate allegations of corruption and malpractice in the force.
Shatter, who is no longer a TD, resigned from Cabinet in dramatic circumstances in May 2014 after the Taoiseach at the time, Enda Kenny, said he could no longer express confidence in him.
Kenny later corrected the Dáil record in relation to comments he made about Shatter.

Shatter maintained that he had not acted wrongly in dealing with McCabe and was latercleared of wrongdoingby the O’Higgins Commission in 2016.
He won an appeal to challenge the Guerin report in November 2016 and theCourt of Appeal found in his favour, before the Supreme Court upheld that decision lastyearfollowing an appeal by Guerin.
While the report has been removed from the Department of the Taoiseach’s website, it remains in the Houses of the Oireachtas library.
The government accepted representation by Shatter’s solicitors who wrote to the Ceann Comhairle Sean O’ Fearghail last July asking that the report be removed from the library – which brought the matter to be raised in the Dáil today.
Members were asked to approve the Dáil business agenda for Thursday, which includes a motion to delete the report from the library.

Speaking in the Dáil today, Sinn Féin’s Aengus O’Snodaigh said it would set a “dangerous precedent” to proceed with the motion without debate.
“Obviously a promise was made that the Taoiseach is trying to keep. But at this point in time, this should not proceed until a new Government is formed,” he said.
Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy also raised concerns stating that such a motion could set a precedent in terms of the what other reports could be removed or deleted from the Oireachtas Library.
Fianna Fáil also sided with opposition TDs, with Thomas Byrne stating that his party did not believe the matter should be dealt with “as expeditiously as proposed, it is unnecessary to do so. It can be done when members have had sufficient time to consider what is before them”.
Labour’s Brendan Howlin wondered if it is even possible, stating:
The Ceann Comhairle confirmed that even if the Dáil approved the deletion of the Guerin report from the library, the Seanad would independently still have to do so. He said they couldn’t find an example of a report being deleted in this manner before.
The order of business for tomorrow was eventually voted down, including the proposal on the Guerin report and removing it from the Oireachtas Library.
Fianna Fáil voted with Sinn Féin, Greens, Social Democrats, and other opposition members against the deletion of the report.
Clearly displeased with the vote, Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan said: “The Business Committee needs to take a look at itself.”
With a sigh, the Ceann Comhairle replied to the minister: “Your advice is appreciated.”
In a statement from Shatter to TheJournal.ie, he said it was “disappointing” that the majority of TDs attending the Dail opposed the taking of the motion on Thursday that would see the deletion of the report, which he calls “fundamentally flawed”.

He said false allegations made against him were found to be false by independent commissions. In his statement, he hit out against Sinn Féin stating he has been trolled online by party supporters.
Shatter stated the the refusal to allow the motion to be tabled shows “contempt for the truth”.
The Business Committee, which sets the agenda of each sitting of the Dáil, are due to meet again today to discuss Thursday’s agenda.

THE NUMBERS WEREN’T as tight as they are now, but it still wasn’t immediately clear how a government would be formed following the 2016 general election.
However, just like now, there was a consensus that the February election had gone very badly for the government.
Fine Gael had lost 16 seats but was still the largest party.
Labour went from the second biggest party to the fourth, losing a whopping 26 seats.
Fianna Fáil, on 44 seats, trailed Fine Gael by six while Sinn Féin had 23 seats.
Taoiseach Enda Kenny admitted that the FG-Labour government wouldn’t be returning fairly early on count day following the26 Februaryelection.
When the dust settled in the following days, it was clear that putting a government together would require some heavy compromise from the two traditionally largest parties in the Dáil – Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.
But, as is happening this time round, there was plenty of “shadow boxing” and “doing the dance” for weeks (and weeks) on end before they actually sat down and got into the real business of beginning talks to form a new government.
Up against it
Just as is happening now, it looked like both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil would have to do the unthinkable and find some way of working together.
But the situation was slightly different in 2016.
Fine Gael had 50 seats but were well short of the numbers needed to form a government.
On the Monday after the election, former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern told Today with Sean O’Rourke there was “not a chance in hell” of a government being formed by Easter.
He turned out to be correct.

After repeatedly ruling it out prior to the general election, Enda Kenny came out less than a week after the election on2 Marchandadmitted his party would talk to Fianna Fáil.
“The numbers in the Dáil, and the way that they are now falling through, make it difficult to put forward a proposition for government. But that’s what the people expect us to do now.
The next day onThursday 3 Marchhe said that he wouldn’t form a government “at any cost”.
RTÉ reportedthat Fine Gael didn’t want to be in a “hostage situation” where they had to accede to anything Fianna Fáil asked for.
Prior to the talks getting under way with Fianna Fáil, Fine Gaelbegan talking with the newly-formed Independent Alliance- which featured Shane Ross, Finian McGrath and John Halligan, amongst others – on4 March.
At this early stage, McGrath said the discussions were “constructive” but the grouping was also speaking to Fianna Fáil about the possibility of supporting a government.
Ross put his foot in it rather early on in the talks, drawing the ire of Fine Gaelers by referring to Enda Kenny as a “political corpse”.
Impasse
Formal talks between the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil didn’t get under way for some time however, and not until way after the Dáil sat again for the first time on10 March.
As convention dictates, a vote for Taoiseach must be held when the Dáil sits for the first time after a general election.
After a lengthy Dáil debate,no one had a majority so Kenny was forced to resign as Taoiseach. However, he stepped into the role of an acting Taoiseach until a successor could be found.
The process of putting a government into place became a bit disrupted with the traditional exodus of senior ministers to different parts of the world for St Patrick’s Day.
While Kenny was in Washington, the likes of Leo Varadkar, Simon Coveney and Frances Fitzgerald were courting smaller parties and independents aiming to secure their support.
It was a long few months for senior FG figures such as Paschal Donohoe and Richard BrutonLeah Farrell / Rollingnews.ieLeah Farrell / Rollingnews.ie / Rollingnews.ie
Subtle overtures were made by Fine Gaelers, via the media, to Fianna Fáil, with the possibility of an equal split of Cabinet posts and a “rotating” Taoiseach role mooted.
On15 March,TheJournal.iereported the current state of play. At this stage, one Fine Gael figure characterised Fianna Fáil’s position on the grand coalition as “a vitriolic no, nay, never”.
Both main parties were talking to the smaller parties and independents at this stage, but no definitive breakthrough had yet been made.
There were two things that everyone agreed on: This couldn’t go on forever and no TD wanted a second election.
Flirtation
Three weeks after the election, and the two main parties still hadn’t formally spoken.
The mood was summed up by Michael Healy-Rae, who Fine Gael was still courting to back a Kenny-led government on20 March.
Speaking on RTÉ’sThe Week in Politics, the independent Kerry TD said:
“It’s ridiculous to think that Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have not got their heads together, even if it was only to say ‘We can’t come out and find common ground’. That would in and of itself be helpful.
But on it went.
And all this time, the Dáil wasn’t sitting and it was starting to really grate on other TDs.
Speaking after a meeting with Fine Gael negotiators on23 March, independent Denis Naughten – who would go on to serve in government – said that negotiations were intensifying but it was clear that FG + independents was doomed without the support of Fianna Fáil.
It was a long few months for the Fianna Fáil negotiating team.Leah Farrell / Rollingnews.ieLeah Farrell / Rollingnews.ie / Rollingnews.ie
Labelling it the “elephant in the room”, Naughten said: “The two big parties need to come together, they need to engage and we reiterated that again today, but there needed to be some new impetus to move this along.”
After theEasterweekend, there was finally some real progress.
On31 March, 34 days after the election, Enda Kenny and Micheál Martin finally had a substantial chat.
With the Dáil due to (fail to) elect a Taoiseach on6 April, the pair agreed they would meet after that vote. As expected, they both lost the vote to be elected Taoiseachon that date.
During the course of what was said to be a “positive and constructive” hour-long meeting, Fine Gael sources said that Kenny offered a full partnership government involving Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and independent TDs.

Taoiseach has formally offered Michael Martin a full partnership Govt with Independent TDs - a historic change and good for Ireland
This offer was firmly rebuffed by Fianna Fáil,who said the country would not be best served by a coalition of the two parties.
Nevertheless, this was the starting gun to the two parties talking. The main sticking point over the following few weeks turned out to be Irish Water.
The Independent Alliance, meanwhile, finally appeared  to be ready to come on board on15 April,when it outlined the demands it had to enter government. One of these was a guarantee of three Budgets getting over over the line. Fianna Fáil’s Barry Cowen said his party would also examine the three-Budget proposal.
Finishing line
At this stage, the electorate and the media were fed up with the lack of action as after 50 days since the election there still wasn’t a government.
All the while, talks were really starting to intensify between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.
With Fianna Fáil ruling out formally going into government, a minority FG + independents government along with Fianna Fáil’s support had become “the only show in town”.
On21 April, one TD said that “water remains the central issue – both the charges and the structure of the utility”.
That same day Fianna Fáil and Fine Gaelheld talks again. Cowen said:
The next day –22 April– Micheál Martin and Enda Kennyspoke on the phone, and agreed to talk again the next day as both sides stayed firm on Irish Water. Fine Gael wanted to retain the charges, while Fianna Fáil wanted Irish Water broken up and water charges abolished.
Fine Gael finally began to give in on water and, by26 April, Fianna Fáil’s Michael McGrathsaid the talks were“in the end game at this stage”.
Then there was a hiccup in the talks.
Leo Varadkar, who was just a TD at the time, took to the airwaves to state that scrapping charges was the wrong decision and not in the national interest.
He said it would have been “insane” to go back to the people and fight an election on water charges. His comments resulted in a row breaking out between the two parties.
Fianna Fáil’s Michael McGrath said Varadkar’s comments were “deeply unhelpful, unnecessary and self-serving”.
He told the media at Leinster House that he could not understand Varadkar’s timing, and observed that the minister appeared to be positioning himself for a leadership battle within Fine Gael.
By the next day,29 April, all seemed to be sorted, with negotiators from both partiesfinally reaching a dealafter “tortuous” talks.
The agreement provided for a minority government led by Fine Gael, with support from Fianna Fáil in opposition for three Budgets. With Fianna Fáil abstaining, the numbers narrowed and it was no longer needed to have 79 seats to be elected Taoiseach.
Enda Kenny also needed support from at least six more independents to reach the magic number of 58 seats, allowing a minority government to be formed.
This need for independents brought the Independent Alliance back into play at a very late stage.
However, winning their support was far from secure. On2 May, Independent Alliance TD for Roscommon-Galway Michael Fitzmaurice said that the prospect of reaching a deal that week “would be pushing it”.

Talks went on and on ahead of the all-important day when Kenny would try at last to form a government.
D-Day
Even on the day Enda Kenny was elected Taoiseach on6 May, there was high drama in the Dáil.
It wasn’t apparent up until the final moments whether or not he’d have enough votes to be elected Taoiseach.
Surreal situation in the Dáil right now. FG TDs giving speeches as Independent Alliance TDs are still in a meeting, deciding how to vote.— Christine Bohan (@ChristineBohan)May 6, 2016Christine Bohan/ Twitter
Surreal situation in the Dáil right now. FG TDs giving speeches as Independent Alliance TDs are still in a meeting, deciding how to vote.
With Fianna Fáil abstaining, Fine Gael needed the support of the Independent Alliance to get over the line.
That group were holding a meeting deciding how they’d vote even as the debate in the Dáil was under way and debating who’d be voted the next Taoiseach.
After frantic last minute discussions, the Independent Alliance – with the exception of Michael Fitzmaurice – was swayed and a new government was formed.
Nine independents, including the IA, ended up supporting Enda Kenny, and many of them – such as Shane Ross, Katherine Zappone and Denis Naughten – won a seat at Cabinet as a result.
It was a full 70 days after the general election.
70 days after the election this time around would bring us to Saturday 18 April 2020.
The first attempt to elect a Taoiseach – perhaps of many - will take place tomorrow.
SPENDING CHRISTMAS DAY as Taoiseach has some extra significance for Leo Varadkar.
Today is Varadkar’s 935th day as Taoiseach and means he has overtaken Fine Gael colleague John Bruton in the length of time he has held the office.
Bruton now returns to the bottom of the exalted list in terms of cumulative days served as taoiseach, with Varadkar potentially moving past both Brian Cowen and Albert Reynolds if he can remain as taoiseach past mid-April 2020.
Varadkar’s has previously stated that his preferred datefor the next general election would be May 2020, at which point Varadkar would have passed both Cowen and Reynolds.
The length of Varadkar’s stay in office is perhaps unexpected, such were the circumstance whenbecame Ireland’s youngest Taoiseach on 14 June 2017.
At that point, the Fine Gael minority government had been in operation for about a year after it was initially formedunder taoiseach Enda Kenny.
Kenny is Fine Gael’s longest-serving taoiseach having spent six years and three months in office from March 2011 until he was replaced by Varadkar.
Ireland’s first taoiseach WT Cosgrave spent almost over nine yearsin office (as President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State) and latterly became leader of Fine Gael, but his time as taoiseach from 1922 was during his leadership of Cumann na nGaedheal, a forerunner to Fine Gael.

Only two taoisigh have served more days in office than Cosgrave, Fianna Fáil’s Bertie Ahern and Éamon de Valera.
Ahern spent an unbroken period in office of ten years and ten months from June 1997 but de Valera remains way out in front with 21 years and two months over three periods as taoiseach.
FORMER TAOISEACH ENDA Kenny said today that he wants to see a “resurgence of pride” in Dublin’s North inner city.
Launching a strategic plan for the northeast inner city for the next three years at  Ballybough Community Centre this morning, Kenny issued a challenge for the young and old people in the area to make the area a place to be “recognised for quality, integrity, trust and opportunity” both at home and abroad.
Speaking at the launch of the progress report on the north inner city task force report today, his first public engagement since he stepped down as Taoiseach, Kenny said “it’s your area, its your place, your people”.
To applause, Kenny told the crowd that he wanted to see a “resurgence of pride so that when people are asked where are they from, they say ‘the North inner city, a place that we transformed with the help of a lot of people”".
The task force, launched in 2017 by Kenny, is a major initiative focused on the development of north-east inner city. It was rolled out following a spate of gangland shootings in the region.
Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said that the programme was set up in a “moment of darkness”, when the government and the community came together in the aftermath of a “truly extraordinary cycle of murder and violence”.

Donohoe, commended Kenny for his work on the project, stating that despite no longer being Taoiseach, Kenny is a frequent visitor of the area and champion of the project.
In his speech, Kenny said he spoke to one woman who had recently completed an apprenticeship in one of the large corporations situated just off Sheriff Street, highlighting what it meant to the local woman to get such an opportunity.
Developing apprenticeships with local businesses and industry in the IFSC for young people is one of the key focuses of the plan, with 18 paid student work placements taking place during the summer.

The chair of the taskforce, Michael Stone, sent out a clear message to companies located in the area, stating it is “the duty of businesses in the North inner city to get involved in the area”. He added that companies can’t come into the area, and build buildings in the area, without supporting the community.
In 2017, when visiting the area,Kenny spoke to one manwho said he was discriminated against in a job interview because he came from the area.
“How could a knacker like that speak Portuguese,” is what the young man claimed was said about him when applying for a job in the area.
The local man, Paul McKeown told Kenny at the time that he had experienced discrimination while job-seeking, despite having a Master’s degree and being fluent in Portuguese.
“No one, no one should have to deal with that,” said Kenny at the time.
Since 2017, a number of companies in the area have been offering internships, jobs and funds have been established to give young people experience as part of a youth diversion programme.
In 2019, €6.5 million in funding was dedicated to the project which helped set up a new inclusion health hub as well as a rehab centre for drug users from the Dublin 1 area.
EVER WONDER WHAT former Taoisigh get up to once they’re out of office?
We’re sure Enda Kenny doesn’t spend every day hanging around with celebrities, royals and assorted sailing types – but that’s exactly what he was up to yesterday.
The former Fine Gael leader, who left office in June 2017, was part of the winning crew in Bear Grylls’ yacht at a charity royal regatta on the Isle of Wight.
The fancy affair was hosted by none other than the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge Prince William and Kate Middleton and took place in the seaport town of Cowes.
Enda was part of TV star and adventurer Grylls crew on the yacht for African wildlife conservation charity Tusk, which won the competition outright.

We’re told he’s a supporter of the charity and that support obviously gets him some nice days out from time to time.
Seven other charities took part in the competition yesterday, with William and Kate also climbing onboard, but it was the dynamic duo of Grylls and Kenny who took home the gold.
Of course this isn’t Enda’s first time hanging out with the royals since his retirement.
He was spottedrubbing shoulders with Harry and Meghan last yearhe handed out awards at a polo tournament.
The former Taoiseach is clearly making the most of his time since he surrendered the Fine Gael leadership. Beats chasing rats around the Dáil bar any day.

EARLIER THIS WEEK, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (Dper)published the updated listof government special advisers and their salaries.
It revealed the pay of 58 different advisers, nine of whom are paid above the maximum allowed salary on their payscale. This breach is only allowed with the agreement of Dper.
Three-and-a half years ago,TheJournal.iepublishedan article called “The Advisers”, it looked at this team of special advisers who provide counsel to senior ministers.
The idea was to take a look at who made up the inner circle of Enda Kenny’s government, and how much they were paid to be there.
That article was written a month before the 2016 general election, which dispensed with the Fine Gael-Labour coalition and led to the current Fine Gael minority government.
Kenny has also since departed as Taoiseach. He remains as a TD but was also recently named as an adviser himself toa Dublin-based investment fund.
But what about the advisers in his government? Have they moved on to the private sector too or are they still working away in Leinster House?
We decided to take a look.
RollingNews.ieRollingNews.ie
Overall, it’s a bit of a mixture. Some are still advising ministers but a significant number have indeed moved into the corporate world in various capacities.
Depending on your definition, at least 12 have made that particular jump. This is about a third of the advisers we looked at it 2016.
Of those 12, eight advisers had been under Fine Gael ministers while four were under Labour ministers.
The types of roles are broadly similar, with 10 being in the corporate strategy and public affairs arena.
The tech industry has been a significant beneficiary of their public affairs expertise with at least four working for tech firms after their time with the government.
Of those not working in the corporate world, about 16 remain working in government and/or politics in some way.
Six of the 19 ministers from 2016 are still in ministerial positions and many of their advisers either remain with them or are in a related department.
With Labour no longer being in government, a number of the 2016 Labour advisers are in currently positions with the union and labour movement.
Several of the Labour advisers worked as part of the successful campaign to re-elect Michael D Higgins.
So, minister-by-minister, what is the advisers Class of ’16 up to now?
At the beginning of 2016, Kenny had three advisers and his chief of staffMark Kennelly. Kennelly was a long-time operator within Fine Gael and was Kenny’s right-hand-man.
The Kerryman now operates his own strategic advisory business, focusing on public and European Union affairs,according to the University of Limerick Foundationof which he is a member.
Kenny’s three other advisers wereAndrew McDowell,Paul O’BrienandAngela Flanagan.
Flanaganremains as a special adviser in the Department of the Taoiseach to Leo Varadkar on a salary of €105,000.
O’Brienhas indeed made the jump into the corporate world and is lead director for public affairs with PR firm Drury | Porter Novelli.
McDowellis nowvice president at the European Investment Bankhaving been nominated to the position by Kenny in 2016.
Burton had chief of staff Ed Brophy and advisers Terry Quinn, Claire Power and Karen O’Connell.
The then-Labour leader survived a difficult election for the party in 2016 and was returned as a TD but she is now on the opposition benches.
Ed Brophyremains in a senior advisory role within the government but was in the private sector for a period in recent years.
He is currently special adviser to Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe and on a salary of €98,391 having been appointed to the position last year.
Before that, Brophy was also co-founder of the Ireland Thinks research company and worked for executive recruitment firm Accreate before being taken on by Donohoe.
A few weeks after rejoining the fold, he raised some eyebrows by getting involved in a Twitter spat with Social Democrat councillor Gary Gannon.
Terry Quinnwas deputy head of the Central Bank’s Irish Economic Analysis Division when he was seconded to the Tánaiste’s team in late 2014,a position he has since returned to.
Claire Poweris now an adviser to President Michael D Higgins in Áras an Úachtaráin after being director of the campaign to re-elect him.
Karen O’Connell, who was in the car with Burtonduring the Jobstown incident in 2014, now works as a site reliability engineering for Google Ireland.

Lavelle decided against seeking re-election in the locals this year and he currently works as head of the Irish Whiskey Association, which is part of drinks industry lobbygroup the Alcohol Beverage Federation of Ireland.
In losing his seat in 2016, James Reilly was perhapsFine Gael’s biggest casualty in the general electionbut he was appointed to theSeanad by Taoiseach Enda Kenny.
His two advisers at the time wereMark CostiganandCamile Loftus.
Former journalist Costigan was one of the most experienced advisers working in government having served as a government press secretary during the Fianna Fáil coalition governments between 2005-2011.
He was taken on as a spokesperson for James Reilly in 2011 and advised the minister until Reilly lost his seat.
Costigan has now left the political world completely and works with Bere Island Community Radio in West Cork.
Loftus still works in the political arena as a social policy researcher and analyst.

Government Press Secretary Sarah Meade (far right) alongside three ministers.RollingNews.ieRollingNews.ie
Heather Humphreys was seen as a surprise inclusion in an Enda Kenny cabinet reshuffle in 2014 but she has since reaffirmed and strengthened her position in Leo Varadkar’s cabinet.
She’s now Minister for Business, Enterprise & Innovation but neither of her special advisers from 2016 are directly with her.
Former journalistSarah Meadewas an adviser with Humphreys but she’s now in the role ofassistant government press secretaryin the Department of the Taoiseach.
Lorraine Hall’sfamilial connection to Humphreys (she’s her second cousin) led to some controversy when she was appointed as special adviser but Hall no longer works in government. Instead, Hall now works for lobby group theAlcohol Beverage Federation of Ireland.
Alan Kelly famously retained his seat in the 2016 general election and celebrated in full-throated fashion. Kelly had two special advisers at the time.
Cónán O’Broinis now a media relations specialistat the Central Bankand has also written some commentary about Irish economic affairs.
In 2017, he wrote in the Irish Independent that the government needed to prepare for every “conceivable contingency plan in place for dealing with the consequences of a hard Brexit”.

Teneo was co-founded by Alan Kelly’s brother Declan, who remains the firm’s CEO.
Before that, McGrath was policy adviser to Minister of State Mary Mitchell-O’Connor for a short period.
Paul Kehoe is the only minister who is still in the same portfolio as three-and-a-half years ago. He has been in fact in the position for the past seven years, something the Taoiseach referenced indefending him during the recent naval controversy.
Kehoe’s adviser from 2016Mark O’Dohertyis still an adviser but is now with current Education Minister Joe McHugh. His salary has increased from €84,706 to €94,535.
Kathleen Lynch was not one of the Labour ministers to survive the election and lost her Cork North-Central seat.

His adviser wasConor Gouldsburywho currently works in the startup sector industry as a public affairs consultant withDogpatch Labs.
ENDA KENNY HAS been named as an adviser for a Dublin-based investment fund that is focused on investing capital from members of the Irish Diaspora.
The former Taoiseach is named as chair of the Global Advisory Council within VentureWave Capital.
The company’s website lists Kenny alongside CEO Kieran McLaughlin and chairman Alan Foy, both of whom have strong businesses links in the Irish-American community.
On Kenny’s involvement in the company, VentureWave Capital lists Kenny as a former Taoiseach and says he:
“The Global Advisory Council comprises leading members of the Irish Diaspora, entrepreneurs, business people, philanthropists and sophisticated investors,” it adds.
McLaughlin is a past president of the worldwide Ireland Funds and Foy is chairman of the Ireland Funds in Ireland.
The Ireland Funds is a philanthropic organisation and network that links business people and members of the Diaspora as part of efforts to support causes in Ireland.
The Irish Times reported this morning that McLaughlin informed friends in an email that Kenny’s involvement with the investment fund is his first appointment since leaving the office of Taoiseach.
The VentureWave Capital website says the company is engaged in “Impact Investing” and describes this as “profit with purpose and capital with conscience”.
“VentureWave Capital is proud to launch an Impact Investment fund for Irish investors and members of the Diaspora seeking a competitive financial return that also delivers a significant benefit to Irish society,” the website states.
VentureWave capital is registered as an Alternative Investment Fund Manager with the Central Bank of Ireland and is headquartered near Government Buildings on Merrion Street.
THE OFFICE OF the Data Protection Commission has said it had “categorically” never been lobbied by former taoiseach Enda Kenny or his office.
The statement comes after the government has beenurged to make a statementafter The Observer published claims that former Taoiseach Enda Kenny offered to use Ireland’s position to lobby on behalf of Facebook on EU data legislation.
“I can categorically confirm that our office has never been lobbied by Enda Kenny or his office,” ODPC head of communications Graham Doyle said.
In a statement to reporters, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that it was up to enda Kenny whether he commented on the story, but added that he doesn’t feel Kenny has to.
Varadkar says he gets lobbied all the time from the large multinationals, and that Ireland has a “good relationship” with all big tech companies, but Facebook is no different from the rest.

Thearticle published detailsfrom a Facebook memo which described Kenny as a “friend of Facebook” and said that the company had a “great relationship” with the former Taoiseach.
The memo claimed that Kenny stated that Ireland’s presidency of the EU provided “the opportunity to influence the European Data Directive decisions” and that Ireland could also influence other member states, “even though technically Ireland is supposed to remain neutral in this role”.
The memo was reportedly contained in court documents as part of a California court case involving Facebook.
Ireland held the presidency of the EUbetween January-June 2013during Kenny’s first term as Taoiseach.
Facebook’s international headquarters are located in Dublin and the article notes the critical role played by Ireland’s data protection commissioner on an EU-wide basis.
In response to the claims made in the article, Fianna Fáil’s enterprise spokesperson Billy Kelleher TD said questions needed to be answered.
“This will require a statement to clarify it (sic) the government and its diplomatic services were being used to lobby other EU member states on behalf of Facebook,” Kelleher tweeted.
Speaking toRTÉ Radio One’s Morning Ireland, Minister for Communications Richard Bruton said that “there’s some things that are absolutely clear”, as he addressed the reports.
“Firstly, there is no watered down rules in Ireland on GDPR. Secondly, it was Enda Kenny himself who dramatically strengthened the powers and resources of the Data Protection Commissioner here in Ireland. Thirdly, both holders of that office have stated that they had no interference from government,” Bruton said.
“I think there’s very strong indication as to the position that Ireland has taken and it has always been that we need strong and fair regulation of these companies,” he said.
“Of course these companies are important players and if they express a view about developing legislation they have to be listened to, just like any other view will be listened to in framing legislation.”
Kenny’s office has been contacted for a statement.

Facebook’s international headquarters are located in Dublin and the article notes the critical role played by Ireland’s data protection commissioner on an EU-wide basis.
In response to the claims made in the article, Fianna Fáil’s enterprise spokesperson Billy Kelleher TD said questions needed to be answered.
“This will require a statement to clarify it (sic) the government and its diplomatic services were being used to lobby other EU member states on behalf of Facebook,” Kelleher tweeted.
Fianna Fáils technology spokesperson James Lawless TD described Kenny’s actions as described by the document as “brazen”.
“The willingness of former Fine Gael, Taoiseach Enda Kenny to bat for Facebook and his brazenness to use Ireland’s position to protect his allies in big tech is indicative of the appalling attitude still held among his party colleagues,” Lawless said.
We certainly need an explanation regarding this matter but we also need a tangible gesture of intent from government that they are serious about appropriately dealing with the giants operating within social media. Our bill can do that and can be prioritised on the legislative agenda if they truly recognise its importance.
Independent MEP Luke ‘Ming’ Flanagan described the claims in the article as “extraordinary”.

ENDA KENNY WAS snapped rubbing shoulders with newlyweds Harry and Meghan earlier this week as the former Taoiseach handed out awards at a polo tournament.
Kenny was photographed between the famous couple and people started wondering why he was at the event in Windsor yesterday.
It turns out that Kenny attended the event because he was the guest of the match’s sponsor – Sentebale – a charity founded by Prince Harry.
Sentebale supports the mental health and wellbeing of children and young people affected by HIV in Lesotho and Botswana.
Kenny said he was delighted to be supporting the charity.
According to a press release sent by Sentebale, Kenny said: “Sentebale plays a vital role in improving the lives of vulnerable young people – yet it is everyone’s responsibility to contribute in whatever way we can.”

IT’S SAFE TO say that Enda Kenny has been keeping the head down since his retirement.
Back in December we had a look at themassive differencesbetween how Enda and Barack Obama were spending their downtime and, well, Enda’s basically been going around like this for the past year.

For some reason, Enda Kenny went to a major polo competition – The Sentebale ISPS Handa Polo Cup in the Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club. You might be asking, who in Ireland cares about polo? Well, if it’s going to be anyone at all, it’d have to be a former Fine Gael TD.
Because The Sentebale ISPS Handa Polo Cup raised £1 million for young people and children with HIV this year, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry went to congratulate them and get some photographs. Enda Kenny also hopped into the photos.

ENDA KENNY HAS said he is “appalled” by what is happening in politics in Britain at the moment, speaking in relation to Brexit.
The former Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader received European Movement Ireland’s European of the Year Award from his successor Leo Varadkar at a ceremony at the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin this afternoon.
European Movement Ireland said the award “recognises and honours individuals or organisations that have made an outstanding contribution to promoting and enhancing Ireland’s place in the EU”.
Accepting his award, Kenny touched on a range of topics in relation to Europe, focusing largely on the issues surrounding Brexit.
Kenny said that he is “appalled by what is happening in politics in Britain” currently.
“The government is driven by internal dissent, lacks credibility and clarity in the most serious issue in decades,” Kenny said.
On 15 December, EU leaders agreed to move onto phase two of Brexit talks. December’s deal promised “full alignment” with the EU single market and customs union rules that are crucial to the Good Friday Agreement.
Noting the agreement in December, Kenny said: “Six months on from the agreement being reached in December last year, very little progress has been made.
“The EU continues to negotiate from a unified position, British business is afraid to speak out because of the spectre of the Labour government.
The EU has set a ‘by October’ deadline for it to agree with the UK a final legal text of the Withdrawal Agreement. That is so it can be ratified by the European Parliament, the Council and the UK.
Northern Ireland and the borderhas emergedas one of the key issues for negotiators in Brexit talks, with all sides insisting that there can be no hard border between the North and the Republic post-Brexit.
The UK has committed to providing technological solutions to the issue of the border. May committed that if the EU did not accept these solutions, a backstop plan would be put in place that would avoid this.
“The EU Council meeting in October is not a negotiating meeting. If negotiations have not been concluded before that meeting, then the EU Council will meet to discuss among themselves without Britain. This is really crucial,” Kenny said.

Last week, the UK government proposed that a “backstop” to be put in place should there be no Brexit border deal which would end in 2021.
‘We need significant progress’
Speaking before Kenny at the event, Varadkar also touched on the issues surrounding Brexit, and said that he wants to ensure that the “future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom is as close and comprehensive and ambitious as possible”.
However, Varadkar noted that a Withdrawal Agreement needs to be agreed on first and Ireland needs to see “significant and substantial progress” on the backstop solution for the border if it is to agree on a final legal text.
Varadkar spoke of the impact that Kenny had during the early days of the Brexit negotiations and said that under his “strong” leadership”, the government agreed what Ireland’s priorities with regard to Brexit should be.
“With Enda firmly at the helm, we succeeded in ensuring that our unique concerns relating to Northern Ireland were listened to and understood and our concerns became European concerns and that has made all the difference for me and the Tánaiste in the year gone by,” he said.
The award
Earlier this week, a spokesperson for European Movement Ireland toldTheJournal.iethat Kenny was to receive the award “for his work in building Ireland’s relationship with European through some of the most challenging circumstances in our recent history”.
They cited his work chairing the European Council in 2013 as well as “preparing the ground for the decision to include the Irish border as a priority issue in the Brexit negotiations and establishing the All-Island Civic Dialogues on Brexit, which have proved vital in helping civil society and business prepare for Brexit”.
Since the award was established in 1988, Irish individuals with backgrounds in art, business, politics and administration have received it. Previous winners include playwright Brian Friel, businessman Michael Smurfit, former Taoiseach Garret Fitzgerald and former Secretary General of the European Commission Catherine Day.

ENDA KENNY IS set to receive European Movement Ireland’s European of the Year Award.
The former Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader will receive the award from his successor Leo Varadkar at a ceremony at the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin city on Monday.
European Movement Ireland said the award “recognises and honours individuals or organisations for their outstanding contribution to promoting Ireland’s place in Europe and to the development of the European agenda as a whole”.

CABINET IS TO discuss the possibility of Ireland getting its own Independence Day.
A prospective bill, which is to be debated in the Seanad today, would designate 21 January Declaration of Independence Day.
Before getting too excited – the day would not add a public holiday to Ireland’s calendar.
Theidea of formally recognising the 21 January(the date the first Dáil sat in 1919) has been suggested by Fianna Fáil Senator Dr Keith Swanick.
This was the date of the very first meeting of the first Dáil and the Declaration of Independence. Members of the first Dáil met in the Round Room of the Mansion House in Dublin.
Speaking toTheJournal.iein January,Swanick saidthe day would allow for the anniversary to be commemorated by schools, public bodies and community groups.
“I believe the importance of this occasion needs to be marked,” he said.
The government is yet to state whether it will support the bill, with a government source saying that “no formal decision” will be made until ministers discuss the issue at Cabinet today.
Last year, former Taoiseach Enda Kennyruled outsuch a move.
When asked byTheJournal.ie, he said:
THOSE WERE THE words uttered by US Vice President Mike Pence at a St Patrick’s Day dinner attended by former Taoiseach Enda Kenny last year.
It’s fairly common for Americans to claim they have Irish roots (no matter how distant) – and to be honest, politicians are only too happy to let them.
With 93,800 trips by people from US and Canada last year – up 2,800 – they mean big money to the Irish tourism sector.
Money, business and tourism is what the shamrock trip is all about. So it will go ahead, despite objections to Irish taoisigh visiting Donald Trump.
And, when US Vice President Mike Pence and House Speaker Paul Ryan speak about their Irish heritage to the Taoiseach during this week’s St Patrick’s Day celebrations, Leo Varadkar will indulge them.
The Taoiseach is heading on a whirlwind trip of America today visiting Texas, Washington DC and New York.
Varadkar’s first trip to the White House as Taoiseach
On his first St Patrick’s Day trip as Taoiseach, Varadkar, like his predecessors before him, will be meeting many high-powered American politicians, as well as the US President (of course) and a handful of governors and business people.
The vice president is central to the celebrations every year, with a breakfast hosted for the Taoiseach and his officials at his residence.
Former taoiseach Enda Kenny had high praise for the vice-president last year on Twitter, saying that he understood Ireland – a message Kenny was widely criticised for.
While pressure was on Kenny to raise the issue of immigration (his visit coincided with the date of Trump’s so-called immigration ban), this year there will be a focus on whether Varadkar raises the issue of LGBT rights with the vice president who has adocumented history of approving legislationhostile to gay rights.

However, it makes sense that Pence would take a central role this week as he does have bona fide Irish roots.
His grandfather emigrated to the US from Tubercurry, County Sligo in the 1920s, and it is understood he passed through immigration inspections at Ellis Island.
His great-grandmother came from Doonbeg, County Clare, home to Trump’s famous Irish golf resort. Pence is believed to have been quite close to his grandfather, someone he says was a great inspiration to him.
Summers in Ireland
The vice-president has returned to his ancestral home on many occasions over the years, spending summers in Ireland, cutting turf and saving hay in Clare and Sligo.
Although raised a Democrat by Irish-Catholic parents, Pence became a born-again Christian and shifted politically to the right.
Last year, Pence used his speech at the Ireland Funds dinner in Washington (for which he was guest of honour) to speak about the importance of his Irish heritage.
This is where he spoke about ‘carrying Ireland with him everywhere he goes’.
Pence was presented with an elaborate family tree and with the original roll book from the Co. Sligo school where his grandfather was educated in 1912.
Addressing the crowd at the gala, Kenny said;
“I know Vice President Pence has been a regular and diligent visitor to the old country, to our country, to Ireland.”
For his part, Pence recalled how on one of his first trips to Ireland he was allowed to help in the bar and he told an old woman that he was related to the owners. He said:
House Speaker’s Irish roots
The Taoiseach will also meet House Speaker Paul Ryan while in Washington.
Ryan claims his Irish roots go all the way back to the Famine, explaining that his relatives hail from Kilkenny. His grandfather, James Ryan arrived in the United States in 1851, in search of the American dream.
Ryan identifies as Irish-American and even has a Kilkenny GAA jersey hanging in his office.
Clearly proud of his ancestry, he showed it off to Minister Charlie Flanagan when he visited Capitol Hill last year, and just recently, the Ceann Comhairle Sean O’Fearghail paid him a visit.

Last year, Ryan spoke about his fondness for Ireland, stating that “he loved” St Patrick’s Day.
Revelling in the 2017 celebrations – the first of the Trump administration’s – he paid particular homage to the black stuff at the Capitol Hill luncheon with President Trump and the Taoiseach (former US Press Secretary Sean Spicer was also in attendance, as was Sinn Féin’s Gerry Adams).
While Varadkar will be spending a lot of time with the two Republicans, he will also meet with many Democrats.
The undocumented Irish is always a talking point during the St Patrick’s Day visit, but the Taoiseach is likely to discuss the stalemate in Northern Ireland, and the threat Brexit is posing to the Good Friday Agreement and the border.
It is also expected that a special envoy to Northern Ireland (committed to in recent weeks by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson) will be announced, with speculation that a new US ambassador to Ireland will also be announced.

COMPANIES WITH THEIR headquarters in the IFSC have “a duty” to give back to Dublin’s north inner city, said Finance and Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe.
Speaking at the launch of the progress report on the north inner city task force report today, Donohoe said it is essential companies in the area integrate their business into the community to ensure there are fair job opportunities and training for local people.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar also acknowledged that government departments located in and around the Sheriff Street could do more to employ people from the local community.
The task force, launched last year by former Taoiseach Enda Kenny, is a major initiative focused on the development of north-east inner city. It was rolled out following a spate of gangland shootings in the region.
IFSC businesses
Earlier this year, the minister said he invited all of the key employers from the area to Government Buildings to highlight what they could do to help. These include companies in the tech, finance and insurance sectors.

“They do have a duty back to the community which they are located,” said Donohoe, who added that many companies have begun to offer internships, training programmes and jobs to locals.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said it is important to recognise that many companies are doing a lot for the Sheriff Street locality.
“A number are offering internships and roles in the company and it is not just working in the post room, it is positions in good jobs with prospects,” he said, adding that IFSC businesses are also offering funds to give young people experience in sales training as part of a youth diversion programme.
However, he said:
The minister said the government working group has identified individuals from the area they believe if “brought into mainstream work in this part of the city would thrive in it and would be really successful for themselves and the companies”.
Donohoe name-checked accountancy firm PWC and insurance company AIG as leading the way in this respect.
“We have seen a real response back from them [IFSC firms] at the moment, and a key action called out in the report is that we will continue with this work across 2018, with companies like PWC and AIG leading the way in investing and employing people here in the local community who are going to thrive in those kind of environments,” said the minister.
Giving jobs to local people
The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Department of Social Protection, and the Department of Education are all located in the north inner city.
“It would be useful for us as a government, as well as asking businesses to play their part, to see what part what the departments who have their headquarters could do to provide employment opportunities,” said Varadkar.

While visiting a number of community groups this morning, the Taoiseach announced a further €3.5 million in funding for the regeneration of the area.
These funds will be used to roll out some major infrastructure projects such as a new primary care centre to be located at Summerhill (due to be opened in mid 2018), the refurbishment of Fitzgibbon Street Garda Station and the development of a new community hub at Rutland (currently at design stage).
Gangland violence
The Taoiseach also spoke about gangland violence in Dublin’s north inner city, stating his predecessor, Enda Kenny, asked him to pay close attention to progress of the task force.
Varadkar said gangland violence had a “devastating” impact on local communities and pledged that his government is going to “redouble” its efforts for 2018.
He was also asked if he is confident the gardaí can bring an end to the Hutch-Kinahan feud.
He thanked the gardaí and “decent” local people for their work to date.
“We should never forget that people who live in this neighbourhood are honest, decent people and they don’t deserve to have violence on their doorstep in the way they have had for the last number of years. We are doing all that we can,” said Varadkar.
The Taoiseach said the government is taking a two-pronged approach by tackling crime with a strong justice element, while also trying to tackle some of the underlying causes of crime, which he said are rooted in disadvantage.
Ensuring that young people growing up in the area given all the opportunities possible to make sure they don’t “get lured into a life of crime” is key, said Varadkar.
2017 WAS THE year that saw one of the world’s greatest statesmen hang up his political hat: former US President Barack Obama.
Fine Gael’s Enda Kenny also retired.
It’s been a contrasting few months out of office for the pair of them, to say the least.

Former Taoiseach Enda KennyArtur Widak / SIPA USA/PA ImagesArtur Widak / SIPA USA/PA Images / SIPA USA/PA Images
AFTER MONTHS OF speculation, Enda Kenny announced he was stepping down as Fine Gael leader on 17 May 2017.
He stayed on as Taoiseach for another four weeks, until Leo Varadkar succeeded him after beating Simon Coveney to become the new leader of Fine Gael and the country.
In the weeks surrounding his departure from office, Kenny received a number of emails and letters about his record – they were mostly positive.
The correspondence was released toTheJournal.ieunder a Freedom of Information request.
In one email, a person wrote: “On behalf of myself and my family and particularly my daughter who is 7 years old and a big fan, who shed a tear this evening when she heard you were stepping down (because she thinks you’re so nice and kind not like Donald Trump who she thinks looks mean!) I would like to say thank you for your years of hard work and effort on behalf of the Irish people.
“I have not always agreed with your policies but I have always felt your heart was in the right place and your intentions honourable. I wish you the best of luck in the next phase of your life.”
Department of the TaoiseachDepartment of the Taoiseach
Another person wrote: “You have been a Taoiseach to be proud of. You raised the country up when it was in the depths of despair.
In another email, a person said they and their family had been Fianna Fáil supporters for decades but “broke with that tradition two general elections ago and voted for you to lead us out of the sorry mess our country was in at the time”.
“You and your ministers have brought our little country from a state of chaos and hopelessness to the country we are today with your courage and your unwavering desire to do the right thing for the right reasons.”
Department of the TaoiseachDepartment of the Taoiseach
A woman living in Chicago emailed Kenny to ”commend” him for “two brave actions: your denunciation of church claims of immunity from the horrendous crimes of child abuse; and your speaking truth to [US President Donald] Trump over the issue of immigration”.
“My grandparents were immigrants from Ballinrobe and Swinford, so I’m an honorary granddaughter of Mayo. I’ve been proud of your courage,” she added.
Another person who was sorry to see Kenny leave wrote: “I am sad today that you have taken the decision to resign as party leader and very soon will no longer be the leader of the country.
The person commended Kenny’s “fantastic” experience at European and international leave, writing:”There have and always will been problems at home but you have steered the way through and I think it’s a huge mistake that you will not be leading and steering the country through the Brexit process.”
‘Good riddance’
Not all of the emails and letters were positive. One negative email stated: “Thank God you’re finally off … back to the bog you came from. Good riddance.
“You’ll only be remembered for all your lies, tall tales, complete arrogance and utter failure to lead this tiny country. Nice to know we forced you out in the end!”
Department of the TaoiseachDepartment of the Taoiseach
Another person who wasn’t a fan of Kenny wrote: “Thank god you are gone. You have always looked after yourself, not the citizens of Ireland except the rich.
“Shame on you, you and your government have ripped off the new poor and the OAPs,” the person wrote, adding that Kenny should “hand back all your pensions”.
EXCHANGING GIFTS IS customary when a head of state visits Ireland, and when our Taoiseach makes a trip abroad.
Enda Kenny and Leo Varadkar welcomed a number of leaders to Ireland this year, as well as representing the country overseas on several occasions.
Documents released toTheJournal.ieunder a Freedom of Information request show that the most expensive gift given by Kenny was to US President Donald Trump during the St Patrick’s Day visit to the White House – a €300 shamrock bowl.
On the same visit, Trump and First Lady Melania were given a Bord Bia hamper of Irish foods (no charge), while Trump was given cufflinks worth €67.65, and Melania received a tablerunner and set of six napkins worth €134.07 and a brooch worth €35.
Their son Barron Trump (who was about to turn 11) received a copy of The Moon Spun Round, a children’s book of WB Yeats’ work, worth €19.95.
Other US officials who received gifts on the St Patrick’s week trip included:
The second most expensive gift given by Kenny was to Prince Charles in May – a rare copy of the book Classic Irish Houses of the Middle Size worth €275.
Kenny was also fond of giving people jerseys – Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy received a Galicia jersey (free), while former United States Ambassador to Ireland Kevin O’Malley got a Mayo jersey worth €43.05, as well as €67.65 cufflinks.
Socks for Trudeau
On Kenny’s visit to Canada in May, he gave Prime Minister Justin Trudeau cufflinks worth €67.65 and a copy of Best Loved Poems: Favourite Poems from the South of Ireland, worth €25.
By the time Trudeau returned the visit to Ireland in July, Varadkar had succeeded Kenny. The new Taoiseach gave Trudeau a framed photograph of Skellig Michael worth €198.78; a rare copy of a book of Yeats’ poems worth €175; and, of course, Book of Kells socks worth €14.99.

Trudeau’s wife Madame Sophie Gregoire Trudeau received a brooch worth €69.95 and a green woollen scarf worth €40. Their three-year-old son Hadrian received the same children’s book about Yeats as Barron Trump.
Back in June, Varadkar welcomed British Prime Minister Theresa May and Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster to Dublin. May received a Dublin Crystal vase worth €30, while Foster was presented with a print of a well-known oak tree in Enniskillen worth €140.
No gifts over the value of €650 were received by either Taoiseach between 1 January and 14 November, meaning no official record of the items had to be kept.
FORMER TAOISEACH ENDA Kenny sought to clarify Dáil record yesterday about statements he made about an Irish national in Iraq over 13 years ago.
Margaret Hassan was an aid worker in Iraq who was abducted and murdered in  November 2004. Her body has never been recovered.
She was married to an Iraqi man, but Kenny said he mistakenly said in the Dáil on 17 November 2004 that she had converted to Islam.
“This statement was untrue,” he said.
On that day, commenting on the news that Hassan had died, the former Fine Gael leader said: “Margaret Hassan converted to Islam. The prayers at her funeral will ask for forgiveness for our living and our dead, those who are present and those who are absent, for our young and our old, and for our males and our females.
Oireachtas.ieOireachtas.ie
Commenting yesterday, Kenny said: “Margaret Hassan was a devout Catholic who continued to practice her religion during the years she was in Iraq.
Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl added: “I am sure the family of the late Margaret Hassan will deeply appreciate the Deputy’s comments.”
GAA ALL STAR Alan Dillon is to put his name forward to replace former Taoiseach Enda Kenny on the party ticket for the Mayo constituency.
The chairman of the Castlebar Fine Gael executive confirmed toThe Connaught Telegraphtoday that Dillon’s name would be going forward at the party’s selection convention in January as a candidate to run in the next general election.
John McHugh confirmed to the local paper that he only became aware of the GAA star’s interest last weekend, but said the party had been searching for a suitable candidate in recent months.
Dillon told theMayo Newsthat he has always been interested in getting involved with the party, stating that he comes from a strong Fine Gael family.
“It is not for me to decide whether that is in the next general election or not. That is up to the party,” he said.
The Mayo football player said it would be a “big opportunity”.
A Fine Gael spokesperson confirmed toTheJournal.iethat Dillon has joined the Fine Gael party “and is a welcome addition to the party in Mayo”.
“With regards to any candidate selection process, no date has yet been set for the Mayo Selection Convention. It is of course open to any party member to put themselves forward for selection in the usual way,” they added.
General election
Since stepping down as Taoiseach, it has been reported that Enda Kenny will not be running in the next general election.
There had been some speculation that his daughter Aoibhinn might have been interested in taking his seat, but this now seems unlikely.
Minister for Rural and Community Development and Mayo TD Michael Ring toldTheJournal.iethis afternoon that he was “delighted” with the news about Dillon.
“It is great to see new people join us in Fine Gael,” said Ring, adding that he intends to run for election again.
Ultimately, who is selected at the convention is a matter for Fine Gael delegates, he said.
The Mayo constituency is a four-seater, with the Fine Gael party running three candidates last time around – Enda Kenny, Michael Ring and Michelle Mulherin.
Kenny and Ring were both elected, with Mulherin later becoming a member of Seanad Eireann.
It’s understood that Fine Gael will put forward three names from the party in the next general election.

THE CURRENT TAOISEACH and his predecessor are two very different people – and especially when you’re looking at them from Oliver Callan’s point of view.
The impressionist and satirist spoke to us about how he pinned down his imitations of Leo Varadkar and Enda Kenny. The best way to mimic Leo’s voice? Think of a didgeridoo, Callan said.
He also outlined three impressions he has found most difficult – Ryan Tubridy, Dave Fanning, and Marian Finucane.
Watch the full video above.
Callan’s Kicks is on RTÉ Radio 1 at 6.30pm every Friday.Listen back here.
LEO VARADKAR TO DONALD Trump: “You know that claim you made about our corporation tax rate? Well, it was ‘fake news’”.
That was essentially what theTaoiseach said in the Dáil two weeks ago, using Trump’s own catchphrase (and new addition to the Collins Dictionary) to mock a speech the US president madein the White House’s Rose Gardenwhere he name-checked Ireland.
“You look at other countries and what they’ve done, and we’re competing with other countries,” Trump said. “When China is at 15% and I hear that Ireland is going to be reducing their corporate rates down to 8% from 12%,” said Trump.
The Department of Financestrongly deniedTrump’s claim and when the Taoiseach was asked about it, he simply replied with a grin on his face:
Fast forward a couple of weeks and Varadkar is stateside, wooing US tech companies with talk about their connections to Ireland, with an added dash of Irish malarkey, just to keep the US business punters on side.
The former Taoiseach Enda Kenny was often criticised for playing up to the Irish stereotype with US business and political leaders.
While Varadkar may not be as obvious about it, there are of course the Irish references thrown into the odd speech which he knows the Americans will lap up.

Speaking in San Francisco City Hall, Varadkar said:
While in a speech to a business dinner in Seattle, he said:
Just enough Irish ancestry talk to keep American eyes smiling.
But the Taoiseach has been received well by the Irish in America.
One business person attending one of Varadkar’s events said that to have a gay Taoiseach who is son of minority parents representing Ireland “in this political climate is amazing, for either Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil – it’s an awesome message”.
Trade mission
How are such trade trips regarded by Donald Trump?
The truth is, Trump does not like for one minute that US companies are choosing to locate in Ireland to take advantage of our generous corporation tax rate.
Leaving aside the argument about whether it’s morally right for large conglomerates to avail of low taxes in Ireland, the fact is the US president has Ireland in his sights, and has referenced the country quite a few times in relation to our 12.5% tax rate.
The US president has said America has lost its competitive edge, and that he is willing to lower the corporation tax in a bid to get businesses to stay in the US. He’s also threatened to slap fines on businesses that choose to take business outside American borders.
Leo’s photo-ops with America’s leading tech leaders are sure to rub Trump the wrong way.
First it was a meeting in Microsoft in Seattle, where the Taoiseach pointed out that he was just six years old when the company set up in Ireland. That was 32 years ago and the company now employs 3,000 people in Ireland.
It was then on to Facebook, where the Taoiseach posed for another photo with the company’s founder Mark Zuckerberg, while also announcing the company is going to hire hundreds of additional staff in Ireland.

It was then on to Google where the Taoiseach said he met with some “Irish Googlers” as well as senior executives. And finally, it was on to a meeting with Apple’s Tim Cook.
The Taoiseach was quick to point out that the company employs over 5,000 people in Ireland, though it wasn’t all good news – there was speculation that theApple data centre in Athenry, which was held up due to planning permission objections, might be at risk.

It is serious business though. Ireland has been named the best country in the world for attracting high-value foreign direct investments for the sixth year in a row.
Such companies bring in a massive amount of revenue to the country, and often create hundreds of jobs. That’s often used as a reason to keep Ireland’s tax rate low – although many would argue we are letting these conglomerates off too easy, while the ordinary taxpayer is left with a greater burden.
But the truth is, with Trump threatening to clamp down on American companies investing abroad and promising to make the US corporation tax rate more attractive to businesses, Varadkar knows he must keep the big players sweet.

FORMER TAOISEACH ENDA Kenny received an honorary doctorate from the National University of Ireland (NUI) today.
Having conferred the honorary Doctor of Laws (LLD) degree to the Mayo TD, NUIG President Dr Jim Browne hailed Kenny for his “enormous contributions to national and international politics”.
According to the college, the tradition of conferring honorary degrees dates back to the NUI charter of 1908. Since then NUI has conferred honorary degrees mainly with the purpose of honouring academic distinction, whether in the humanities or in the sciences.
The NUI traditionally honours those who have held the office of Taoiseach.

Kenny was educated at the university in Galway, and later studied in St Patrick’s College of Education in Dublin.
He worked briefly as a primary school teacher before entering the world of politics in 1975 following the death of his father. He became leader of Fine Gael in 2002, leading the party for 15 years. He served as Taoiseach from March 2011 until May 2016.
Since stepping down as Taoiseach, Kenny appears to be enjoying more leisurely activities and has been spotted out and about, enjoying some of his hobbies, such as cycling (he cycles the Ring of Kerry every year) and golf.

Kenny isn’t the only former Taoiseach to be honoured in this way this year.
In July, former taoiseachBrian Cowen was conferred with an honorarydoctorate by the National University of Ireland.
In a speech at the Dublin Castle event, Cowen said that he regrets the jobs that people lost during the recession, but defended his time in government.

FORMER TAOISEACH ENDA Kenny is to receive an honorary doctorate from the National University of Ireland (NUI).
The ceremony is to take place on Monday week, according to the college.
Kenny was educated at the university in Galway, and later studied in St Patrick’s College of Education in Dublin.
He worked briefly as a primary school teacher before entering the world of politics in 1975 following the death of his father.
The doctorate is being conferred by the NUI which represents a number of third level institutions across the country.
Honorary doctorate
Kenny isn’t the only former Taoiseach to be honoured in this way this year.

FAMILY, FRIENDS AND politicians have paid their final respects to former Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave, whose funeral took place in Dublin today.
The former Fine Gael leader was laid to rest at Goldenbridge Cemetery in Inchicore following midday mass at the Church of the Annunciation, Rathfarnham.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was in attendance, as were former taoisigh Enda Kenny, Brian Cowen and Bertie Ahern as well as a number of ministers and other politicians.

MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT Shane Ross was at St Stephen’s Green in Dublin for the first test of the new cross-city Luas line earlier this summer when a can of Dutch Gold beer was shoved into his hand by a nearby construction worker.
The image was captured by Fine Gael TD Noel Rock, and shared on Twitter with the caption: “It is a day for it to be fair. Bag of cans on the tram.”
Some respondents on Twitter found the image humorous, but others reckoned the minister was sending out the wrong message. Rock was quick to jump in to defend his colleague, pointing out:
Ross is indeed a teetotaler – in fact, the long-serving senator-turned-TD hasn’t taken a drink in three decades.
Speaking toTheJournal.iein a wide-ranging interview, he said he made a decision to quit as his drinking was beginning to affect his work.
“I was just drinking far too much. I was in my thirties and it was just affecting my life in every way.
Ross, who was first elected as a senator in 1981, was also working as a stockbroker at the time.
“It was affecting all aspects of my life,” he said.
The minister is now on a mission to take on the Vintners Federation of Ireland (which lobbies on behalf of publicans) and some rural TDs who are fighting his drink-driving Bill.
If introduced, it will mean an automatic driving disqualification for those caught behind the wheel with a blood alcohol level of between 50mg and 80mg per 100ml. At the moment, drivers are just handed down penalty points and a fine.
Vintners chief Padraig Cribben argued earlier this year that Ross’s proposals would not “contribute to saving one life”.
The Bill is due to be debated in the Dáil this autumn, with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar calling for all ministers and junior ministers to back the Bill.
While the Cabinet has endorsed changes to drink-driving laws, its passage through the Dáil is unclear as a decision has not yet been made on whether non-Cabinet members of the party will get a free vote on the matter. Essentially, it’s not a done deal, by any means.
Drink-driving
Ross has publically admitted to having driven while over the limit in the past.
Speaking on RTÉ’s Prime Time in April, the minister was asked he had ever driven while over the legal alcohol limit.
“Of course I have,” he told the programme.
Speaking in more detail this week about that time in his life, he said his professional performance was suffering in a number of ways.
And while it may not have been uncommon, 30 years ago, for people in professional roles to have a drink or two at lunch – Ross said he was thankful that those habits, for most people, were a thing of the past.
There is a different attitude to drinking in the Dáil too, according to the south Dublin TD. In his decades at Leinster House, he said he’d seen some political careers brought to a premature end.
Despite not having held a drink in his hand for the last 30 years, the minister said he did see the humour in his Dutch Gold moment.

Poacher-turned-gamekeeper
While Ross spent years in opposition honing his skills as a critic of the powers-that-be – he now finds himself in Cabinet.
He admits that when he first entered into government with Fine Gael, he saw almost everyone else around the Cabinet table as an adversary.
Sympathising with Fine Gael to a degree, he acknowledged that he didn’t make things easy for them in the early days of government. Things came to a head, he said, in a blazing row with his government colleagues last summer.
“It must have been very difficult for them as we had been in opposition to them and there were some personal animosities. That climaxed in the row that I had last June,” he said.

How was the row resolved?
Ross said there was no “bonding luncheon”. One had been pencilled in, he said – but never materialised.
It was actually his nascent friendship with Enda Kenny – a man he had called a “political corpse” in one of his newspaper columns – that smoothed over the cracks in the fraught relationships within government.
Ross said his friendship with the former Taoiseach developed further after Kenny said he would backhis controversial Judicial Appointments Bill.
So … with his new-found friend gone from the Cabinet table, does he miss Enda Kennny?
“Yes, I do, because he made me laugh a lot.
“Once you get to know him he makes you laugh a lot and that helps enormously. But I get on very well with Leo. Leo has a completely different style and he is very refreshing with his approach.
A FORMER UK Brexit Minister has said that former Taoiseach Enda Kenny was a lot more positive about finding solutions to the issue of a border in Northern Ireland after Brexit, and said that Leo Varadkar’s comments so far are “not terribly helpful”.
Speaking onRTÉ’s Morning Ireland, David Jones MP said that “a technological solution” is required on the issues of the customs union and the Irish border, but said that Enda Kenny’s government appeared more receptive to finding a collaborative solution to the problem.
“I do detect a certain change of tone since Taoiseach Varadkar came to office,” he said. “I think that’s regrettable.”
When pushed on this comment, Jones said that it seemed to him that Kenny was “well disposed” to finding a technological solution butLeo Varadkar’s speech last week“appeared to rule that out”.
Varadkar had said that it was up to the UK to put forward solutions for the handling of the border between north and south in a post-Brexit world. He went on to say that the government’s position is that there should be no border, so it will not help in designing one.
Jones said that the British and Irish economies are very closely intertwined, and that the UK’s decision to leave the EU is something that should be addressed by both governments.
He said the impression he got from Kenny was that he was a lot more positive on finding “technological solutions” to the border issue.
Speaking at Queen’s University in Belfast last week, Varadkar said that the alternative to a customs union could mean a return of border posts, which he called “a brutal physical manifestation of historic divisions and political failure”.
He warned “the clock is ticking” to reach an agreement, as Britain began the two-year process of leaving the bloc in March.
When pressed on what these solutions could be, Jones referenced the border between the US and Canada, and Norway and Sweden.
Jones did, however, rule out similar posts at the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.
He also defended the British government’s approach to Brexit so far, despite admitting that there was no plan put in place before the referendum.
He is no longer a Brexit minister after he was subject to a reshuffle immediately after the general election. Jones said that, despite being moved out, the UK government’s overall approach had not changed.
The MP added that a lot of figures “had been plucked out of the air” when it came to the bill the UK would be required to pay when it leaves the EU.
He did dispute, however, that figures given on how much Britain sends to the EU every week – the £350 million that was quoted widely in the Brexit referendum campaign, for example – were incorrect.
Margaret BullenRTÉRTÉ
THE FASCINATING AND tragic story of a mother who spent her life in a series of Magdalene Laundries will be told this evening.
RTÉ’sLiveline Callbackwill tell the story of Margaret Bullen, a mother-of-three who spent her entire life in state institutions such as the infamous Laundries.
Samantha Long was 29 years old and seven months pregnant in October 2003 when she listened to an edition ofLiveline on RTÉ Radioin which a woman was decrying the fact that one of her good friends had died and been buried in a communal grave by the nuns at her laundry.
And then she heard the woman’s name. Margaret Bullen. Her mother, who she had first met just eight years previously. Who met her and her twin sister in the Gresham Hotel on O’Connell Street carrying an empty handbag because she owned nothing to put in it.
“When we were just two weeks old, Margaret was sent back to work,” Samantha says today,five yearsafter first sharing her story withTheJournal.ie.
Margaret's twin daughtersRTÉRTÉ
She and her twin sister Etta were just seven weeks old in 1972 when Margaret came to visit them at the St Patrick’s Mother and Baby Home in Dublin where they had been born and found them gone. They wouldn’t see her again until 1995.
“When we finally traced her and went to meet her, we didn’t know how to be. Were we supposed to love her, like her?” says Samantha.
When Margaret died in July 2003, the day before her 51st birthday, of Goodpasture Syndrome – a disease sometimes caused by exposure to industrial-strength chemicals like those used in the laundries – her daughters hadn’t spoken to her in some time.
(l to r) Etta, Margaret, and SamanthaRTÉRTÉ
The nuns in question said they had tried to reach out to Margaret’s family, and had then deferred to gardaí who they presumed had made contact. No attempt to follow up was made.
After Samantha heard Margaret’s friend on the radio, Etta phoned the show herself.
“Everyone in the country was listening to that,” says Samantha.
The death of Margaret Bullen and its discussion on the national airwaves was one of the key factors that led to the establishment ofJustice for Magdalenes Research.
When the subject of redress for survivors became a possibility, Samantha and her sister began to tell their mother’s story: “We wanted to make sure that those who were still alive got some money.”
Enda Kenny apologising to the Magdalene residents, Dáil Éireann, 19 February 2013RTÉRTÉ
The publication ofthe McAleese Reportinto the Laundries led to an official State apology to the victims,made by Taoiseach Enda Kenny in February 2013.
“When that was all over I just felt so happy for Margaret,” says Samantha.

TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said he will not rescind US President Donald Trump’s invitation to visit Ireland.
The invite was extended to Trump by theformer Taosieach Enda Kenny during his St Patrick’s Dayvisit to the White House in March.
Prior to the visit,Varadkar said that he“wouldn’t be keen” on inviting Donald Trump to visit Ireland.
When asked during his second Leaders’ Questions session today if he would rescind the invitation, he said he would not.
“I will not, of course, rescind that invitation,” he said, adding that to do so would be “inappropriate” and would create a “diplomatic incident”.
He said no progress has been made in organising such a visit and there is no timeline for it. Varadkar added:
The Green Party’s Eamon Ryan asked the new Taoiseach what he was going to protest against some of Trump’s policies.
Leo Varadkar and Donald TrumpPAPA
Varadkar said if he visits the US in the future or if he attends the White House next March, he will raise issues such as climate change, LGBT rights, and immigrant rights.
“I will absolutely include in those meetings discussions of the issues he mentioned, whether it is climate change, human rights, LGBT rights, and the need to respect Muslim people, whether they are citizens of our country or another country.”
He said he will “never shirk” from raising such issues, adding that he totally rejects the US pulling out of the Paris Agreement on climate change.
The Taoiseach said he will “absolutely” raise such matters in any such meetings he has with the US president.
Varadkar made reference to the speech US President John F Kennedy made in the Dáil in 1963 when he said that the power small countries have is to use their voice to set an example. “That is exactly what I intend to do,” he said.
Confidence in the Garda Commissioner
In his second session taking Leaders’ Questions today, Varadkar was also asked by Sinn Fein’s Mary Lou McDonald if he had confidence in the Garda Commissioner, Noirin O’Sullivan.
O’Sullivan was before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) yesterday to answer questions on the financial irregularities in the Garda Training College at Templemore.
McDonald urged Varadkar not to turn a blind eye to the scandals like his predecessor Enda Kenny.
Yesterday, the Commissioner “could not or would not convey her confidence in her senior officers,” she said, asking the Taoiseach how the public are meant to have confidence in the force, when the Commissioner does not.
“Do you have confidence in the Garda Commissioner,” asked McDonald.
Varadkar said he does have confidence in the Garda Commissioner, as does the government. He said O’Sullivan is “fighting battles on many fronts”.
“That is most uninspiring,” replied McDonald, who pointed out he is treading down the same path as Enda Kenny.
Varadkar said the Charlton Tribunal is underway, as is a number of other investigations into garda scandals.
He said he would not rush to judgement until such investigations are completed.
“I don’t believe in kangaroo courts,” said Varadkar, adding: “I understand that you come from a political tradition that is okay with that, but I do not.”
Attorney General appointment
Meanwhile, Fianna Fáil’s Micheál Martin called for a full debate on the appointment of the former Attorney General, Maire Whelan, to the Court of Appeal.
Martin came in for criticism from Varadkar for comments he made yesterday in the Dáil.
Yesterday, Varadkar said that in the past Fianna Fáil had appointed people such as Supreme Court judge Frank Clarke and former Supreme Court judge Adrian Hardiman.
To which Martin replied: “Máire Whelan is no Frank Clarke. Máire Whelan is no Adrian Hardiman.”
Varadkar said he wanted to offer Martin the opportunity to retract the comments made.
The Taoiseach said he is concerned about the aspirations that were made against Whelan and her capabilities. He said he wanted Martin to be “mindful of the separation of powers” and wanted to give him the opportunity to withdraw his comments.
“You said she was lesser than other people … less capable than people that you mentioned,” Varadkar said.
“Take the opportunity to withdraw it,” butted in Tanaiste Frances Fitzgerald.
You brought in the personalities – you named names, said Martin, adding that none of the other judges mentioned are subject to tribunal findings and citing the Fennelly report which criticises the former Attorney General Maire Whelan.
The matter is due to be debated in the Dáil later this afternoon.
TWO LABOUR WOMEN, Jan O’Sullivan and Joan Burton have said they are disappointed with the reduction of women with senior roles in Government.
After the new Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, announced his new team, O’Sullivan said she was disheartened to see there is now “one less woman sitting around the Cabinet table at a time when we should be promoting women”.
Mary Mitchell O’Connor was the only casualty in Leo Varadkar’s Cabinet reshuffle yesterday, demoted from the Minister for Jobs to super junior minister for higher education.
Chief Whip Regina Doherty was promoted to a ministerial position, but Burton says there is still not enough women.
Burton said during the Fine Gael-Labour Government there were five women in senior roles, plus the Attorney General, Maire Whelan (who has moved to the Court of Appeal).
There are now four women ministers – Heather Humphreys, Katherine Zappone, Regina Doherty and Frances Fitzgerald – and one super junior minister, Mary Mitchell O’Connor. Remaining junior ministers will be announced by Leo Varadkar on Tuesday.
“The former senior minister Mary Mitchell O’Connor has effectively been demoted to being what is called a super junior at the Cabinet table,” Burton toldTheJournal.ie.
“Look at the number of men that have been promoted, so there is one woman put down and then there is three men promoted,” she said.
Burton said she finds the demotion of just one woman “a rather strange decision”.
She pointed out that Humphreys has also seen her ministerial portfolio reduced, with rural affairs being transferred to Michael Ring.
“So all in all, not a great day for women it has to be said.”
IT WAS ONE of the most unexpected lines to ever be uttered in the Dáil chamber during the election of a Taoiseach.
The chamber, the public gallery, the press gallery and Leo Varadkar’s family – who were seated in the ‘distinguished guests’ area – erupted in the laughter when Gerry Adams brought up his fitness class with the Fine Gael leader.
Varadkar later thanked him for “revealing our little secret”, adding that they had in fact attended the same pilates class on a number of occasions.
The image of the new Taoiseach and the Sinn Féin leader on their mats, stretching in the Oireachtas gym, may be a difficult one to shake off.
But, perhaps it could be taken as a sign of  things to come under Leo’s tenure? A Taoiseach who puts an end to Civil War politics, digs about the past …. who is willing to work (anything) out, even with longtime rivals.

That seemed to be a message that Varadkar wanted to convey anyway.
“While we will clash in this Dáil, I want to offer a genuine willingness to work together on matters… That applies to all parties,” he said.
The opposition was far from convinced, however.
The words “right-wing” and “Thatcherite” were bandied about – as voices from the far side of the chamber speculated he would be a Taoiseach who would divide rather than unite.
At 38, Leo Varadkar is the youngest Taoiseach to date. His predecessor, Enda Kenny, told the Dáil he was the man to lead a new generation.
Not everyone was convinced.

“Maybe the Taoiseach-to-be should get to know Sinn Féin,” Adams offered.
Laughter all round
There was plenty of humour and playful swipes from the opposition throughout the two-hour session that saw Varadkar elevated to the most senior job in Irish politics.
Fianna Fáil’s Micheál Martin got in a dig at Fine Gael’s Noel Rock – suggesting that perhaps Varadkar had started off on the right foot, by not having Rock nominate him. (Rock nominated Enda Kenny on four occasions last year, but later became one of the strongest voices to call for him to step down).
Taking aim at another Fine Gael backbencher,  Martin said he happened to agree with Kate O’Connell’s controversial assessment of Varadkar’s supporters as ‘choirboys’ lining up to back the new boss.
The Dublin TD’s comments, you may remember, landed her in hot water during the leadership contest.
To laughter, Martin said he shared her view of his rival party.
Fianna Fáil – in line with the deal they agreed last year to prop up the Fine Gael-led Government – abstained from yesterday’s vote.
A new Taoiseach
During the speeches, Enda Kenny was constantly whispering in Varadkar’s ear – perhaps passing on some last minute advice.
“Good luck to the last fella,” Mick Wallace chimed in from across the chamber – before the votes were cast and the result came in: 57 votes in favour, 50 votes against – Leo Varadkar was to be the new Taoiseach.
Rounds of applause ensued, as the chamber rose to its feet. Handshakes all round from his Cabinet (or those that hoped they would be in his Cabinet) and a notable friendly handshake from the man he defeated to take the top job – Simon Coveney.
In the blink of an eye there was a quick seat swap. Varadkar took the helm, as Kenny stepped aside.

But what will Varadkar be like in office?
Standing in the Dáil, with his beaming parents looking down upon him, Varadkar said the Government he would lead would neither be left or right, but one of the “new European centre”.
He added:
Varadkar said he would seek to build a “republic of opportunity” where “every citizen gets a fair go and has the opportunity to succeed”.
A right-wing Taoiseach?
Many opposition TDs said they found Varadkar to be a decent man, even if they fundamentally disagreed with his politics.
“He won’t be anything other than the most right-wing Taoiseach this State has ever seen,” said Sinn Féin’s Louise O’Reilly, while Solidarity-PBP Ruth Coppinger said Varadkar was a ”hardliner for capitalism” and a representative for the “rich and the elite”.
Adams was another to say he is “too right wing”. No amount of “pilates, frappuccinos, skinny lattes, avocado mash and jogging” would change that, he insisted.
Coppinger urged Varadkar to reach deep down for his “socialist vein”, while the Green Party’s Eamon Ryan urged him to be more like his father, Ashok Varadkar, who recently admitted in an interview with The Irish Independent that he was a socialist at heart. Varadkar’s father looked particularly amused at this contribution.
Before Varadkar left the  chamber, an orderly queue formed to shake his hand.
Then, it was then out to the Plinth. Flanked by his party colleagues, the new Taoiseach emerged out into the sun, to a loud applause.
RollingNews.ieRollingNews.ie
Before getting into his car to speed off to see President Michael D Higgins, he stopped to shake the hands of a few tourists who just happened upon the fanfare during their visit to the National Library.
After picking up his seal of office at the Áras, it was back to Government Buildings to dole out the good and bad news – who would be in Cabinet, and who would miss the cut?
Journalists waited by the stairs to see who they could spot heading down the ministerial corridor. Some – like veteran Michael Ring, who appeared certain he was heading for promotion – could not hide their excitement. Others – like Mary Mitchell O’Connor, who was demoted from Jobs and Enterprise– received less welcome news.
RollingNews.ieRollingNews.ie
With the Cabinet reshuffled, Varadkar listed all the tasks that he wanted them to meet head on.
How the new leader and his dream team will perform? Only time will tell.
But Richard Boyd Barrett hit the nail on the head when he said that after all the drama of leadership contest and election, it’s time for the Government to get down to business.
Now that the theatre is over, Varadkar has come out on top. But, this is where the hard work begins.
LEO VARADKAR IS the new Taoiseach of Ireland.
To much fanfare today, he was elected with 57 votes in favour and 50 votes against.
His first job as leader was to form his new Cabinet.
Here’s in and who’s out.

FINE GAEL LEADER Leo Varadkar has been elected Taoiseach.
Enda Kenny resigned yesterday after six years in the role.
Varadkar, who at 38 will be Ireland’s youngest ever Taoiseach, has succeeded in getting the backing of the Dáil to be the country’s next leader – by 57 votes to 50 (47 people abstained).
He’s expected to announce his new Cabinet this evening, once President Michael D Higgins has made his new role official.

Added to this has been his ability to spin every minor development in one of his departments as a step-change.“It is striking that the strong support which this record won him in his parliamentary party was not reflected in the much broader membership of Fine Gael.“The role of Taoiseach is profoundly different from that of being a departmental minister and party spokesman.  It is only by him holding the office that we will see if Deputy Varadkar is willing to make the changes necessary to be successful.”Jun 14th 201712:26PMMartin tells the incoming Toiseach: “The true mark of success for you Deputy Varadkar will be if you understand just how wrong you are when you say ‘If you try to represent everyone you will represent no one’.“The very definition of the job of Taoiseach and the government is to represent all of the people.“It is not about picking winners and losers, or finding new labels to divide people – it is about representing every citizen. It is about fighting against the growing polarisation we have seen in recent years – where a deep sense of unfairness has developed especially amongst those who feel that their struggles are ignored.”Jun 14th 201712:27PMResponding to Martin’s jab, Noel Rock has tweeted some fire emojis:Whoops!We couldn't find this TweetBurn.Jun 14th 201712:28PMMartin is critical about the appointment of Attorney General Máire Whelan to the Court of Appeal – a job that was not advertised.“Yesterday’s appointment to the Court of Appeal represents the first time in nearly a quarter of a century that an appointment such as this was made in this manner.“It directly by-passed established procedures and the excuse that there were no qualified applicants is clearly false given that the last application process closed nearly six months ago and there was no public advertisement of this vacancy.”Jun 14th 201712:29PMMartin concludes by saying: “The challenges which are faced by our country are as they were last year. The obligation on the government and the Dáil to act constructively to tackle this challenges remains.“After a wasted year of drift and delay the time for excuses is over.“We will have a new Taoiseach who has been chosen by his party to turn around electoral performance.

Speaking of Coveney, let’s throw it back to 1999 – when a young Varadkar was campaigning for the Cork man, his rival in the Fine Gael leadership race.

Christina Finn says the Dáil’s public gallery is packed.
“There’s a photographer outside the chamber taking photos of Varadkar’s family and people are signing the official guestbook.
“His dad looks very proud. His partner and nieces and nephews are here too.”
The last few TDs are now entering the Dáil chamber.
Oireachtas.ieOireachtas.ie
Christina tells us outgoing Taoiseach Enda Kenny has arrived and is shaking hands with Varadkar’s family.
Enda Kenny and Leo Varadkar are having a chat just before the official business kicks off, Christina tells us.
Kenny tells the Dáil he has worked closely with Varadkar for years and believes he will bring “energy”, “integrity” and “skill” to the role of Taoiseach.
He says Varadkar made “significant achievements” while leading the transport, health and social protection departments.
Kenny says Varadkar speaks “for a new generation” and “a modern, diverse and inclusive Ireland”.
Kenny wishes Varadkar and his team the best.
Oireachtas.ieOireachtas.ie
Josepha Madigan seconds Varadkar for the role, saying he is “honest, genuine and decisive, with a first-class intellect”.
She says she believes Varadkar will leave the country in a better place than where he finds it and is “the right person at the right time” to lead Ireland.

Martin gets a big laugh when he says Varadkar has “started well in his decision to get someone other than Deputy Noel Rock to nominate him”, joking that he sent him out of the country during the leadership race.
(Rock previously nominated Kenny for the role, but more recently called on him to set out a timeline for his departure.)
Martin now being more critical of Varadkar and Fine Gael.
“For many years he has been renowned as the most accessible source in government.  His skill at avoiding hard news and distancing himself from the controversies of a government he sat in was remarkable. Added to this has been his ability to spin every minor development in one of his departments as a step-change.
“It is striking that the strong support which this record won him in his parliamentary party was not reflected in the much broader membership of Fine Gael.
“The role of Taoiseach is profoundly different from that of being a departmental minister and party spokesman.  It is only by him holding the office that we will see if Deputy Varadkar is willing to make the changes necessary to be successful.”
Martin tells the incoming Toiseach: “The true mark of success for you Deputy Varadkar will be if you understand just how wrong you are when you say ‘If you try to represent everyone you will represent no one’.
“The very definition of the job of Taoiseach and the government is to represent all of the people.
“It is not about picking winners and losers, or finding new labels to divide people – it is about representing every citizen. It is about fighting against the growing polarisation we have seen in recent years – where a deep sense of unfairness has developed especially amongst those who feel that their struggles are ignored.”
Responding to Martin’s jab, Noel Rock has tweeted some fire emojis:
Burn.
Martin is critical about the appointment of Attorney General Máire Whelan to the Court of Appeal – a job that was not advertised.
“Yesterday’s appointment to the Court of Appeal represents the first time in nearly a quarter of a century that an appointment such as this was made in this manner.
“It directly by-passed established procedures and the excuse that there were no qualified applicants is clearly false given that the last application process closed nearly six months ago and there was no public advertisement of this vacancy.”
Martin concludes by saying: “The challenges which are faced by our country are as they were last year. The obligation on the government and the Dáil to act constructively to tackle this challenges remains.
“After a wasted year of drift and delay the time for excuses is over.
“We will have a new Taoiseach who has been chosen by his party to turn around electoral performance. What we need is a new focus on the much harder work of delivering for the people.”

After welcoming Varadkar’s family to the Dáil, Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams gets straight into criticising Varadkar – challenging his record in the departments of health and social protection.
Referring to Varadkar’s age, Adams says “not all young people are progressive” and he fears the new leader will “drag this government even further to the right”.
On a much lighter note, Adams then says he doesn’t know Varadkar well but they once attended the same pilates class.
THE NATIONAL GALLERY of Ireland re-opened its doors today with over 650 works of art on display in its historic wings, following extensive refurbishment and modernisation.
The Dargan wing closed in 2011 for refurbishment and the Milltown wing followed suit in 2014.
The wings will be open to the general public from 9am tomorrow morning.
The permanent collections of art in the Dargan and Milltown wings of the gallery have been re-designed.
Irish artworks are being hung on the ground floor, with collections from Daniel Maclise, Roderic O’Connor, John Lavery and Jack B. Yeats. Art from other European collections is being hung on the upper floor.
The art will be displayed chronologically rather than in its previous country-specific layout.
Established in 1854, the gallery houses over 16,300 works of art.
More than 150 new pieces of art have been acquired by the gallery since it closed for refurbishment in 2011.

The multi-million euro refurbishment project began in March 2011, with the replacement of the Dargan wing roof, at a cost of just over €2 million.
Since then, the Milltown wing roof has been replaced, along with the repair and restoration of the fabric of its wings. This refurbishment cost an estimated €25.8 million, with a final figure currently unavailable.
A new courtyard was built to fill the space between the wings of the gallery.
Since the refurbishment, over 450 paintings and sculptures were brought into the conservation studio for treatment.

Enda Kenny made his final appearance as acting-Taoiseach to re-launch the space today, accompanied by Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohue and Minister for Arts Heather Humphreys.
“It is appropriate that we are here today to honour and celebrate our National Gallery and our national collections in this time where culture is coming to the fore of our minds in the context of the fantastic work being done through the Creative Ireland programme,” Kenny said.
Creative Ireland is the Government’s five-year initiative to place creativity at the centre of public policy.
“I’ve traveled the roads over the past few years and I’ve seen the emergence of art on the motorways, the dual carriageways, and different spaces and places where local authorities and national authorities provide money to local artists for their artistic endeavors.”
The first exhibition to open in the revamped space is the ‘Vermeer and the Masters of Genre Painting: Inspiration and Rivalry’, opening this Saturday.
WITH A GRIN on his face, Enda Kenny playfully punched his party colleague, Finance Minister Michael Noonan on the shoulder, as if to signal the end of their time in Leinster House.
They’ve been through a lot together.
They both served as Fine Gael leaders, they supported each other as they navigated the recession, and both men are leaving politics in tandem.
After 42 years in politics, and six of those as Taoiseach, the curtain on Kenny’s tenure finally came to an end yesterday.
There were kind words (and some not so kind) levelled at the Mayo man yesterday afternoon:
“Hard-working”, “boundless enthusiasm”, “optimism” and “folksy charm”.
“The prospect of making a speech or listening to them, either of glorification or flagellation, is not something that I really relish because this has never been about me. It has always been about the problems and challenges our people and country face,” said Kenny.
He spoke about how he continues to believe that politics is a noble profession, and one that he is grateful the people of Mayo allowed him to do for so long.
However, Kenny admitted he has made mistakes during his time as Taoiseach.
Ruth Coppinger and Gerry Adams were quick to point some of them out. Coppinger raised the recent case of a young girl who sought an abortion being sectioned, while Adams said he still could not understand why Kenny had not yet recognised the Palestinian State.
Perhaps finding it difficult to listen to their husband and father being slated in public, Kenny’s wife, Fionnuala and son, Ferdia (who were seated in the seats usually reserved for visiting dignitaries) appeared to look to the sky or the public gallery, ignoring the pointed words.
“I am the first to acknowledge I have not got everything right but I can honestly say my motivation was always what I believed was in the best interest of the Irish people,” said Kenny.
Untainted by corruption
The common theme throughout was that Kenny was a leader who was enthusiastic and hopeful when the country needed him to be, while also escaping any sort of taint of corruption. (The fact that this was mentioned a few times perhaps speaks volumes about Ireland’s political past that this is something to be congratulated).

‘I will miss you’
But it isn’t too often that politicians have their rivals say they will miss them.
Adams and Micheál Martin did just that, paying tribute to the man they have spared against for the last six years.
“I will miss you. I will miss your entertaining tales of meetings you have had and, indeed, meetings you have not had, and recollections of people you have met along the way, like the man with the two pints in one hand. I will miss your optimistic energy, your jizz, your sense of mischief, your ability to field questions without giving the smallest clue as to your attitude to the questions you were asked. Forty-two years is a long time to be in the Leinster House bubble and you have earned your time off outside this place,” said Adams.
Meanwhile, speaking with fondness about the Taoiseach, Micheál Martin said they share a love of the great days of boxing, particularly the “we were kings” era.
Martin told the chamber he has learned a thing or two from Kenny, particularly in recent months when some members of his party were plotting a heave.
“The Taoiseach has given a masterclass to certain of his colleagues in how to manoeuvre a difficult situation in a beneficial direction. Rather than disappearing quietly at the first sign of panic from deputies more focused on polls than the work of government, he has managed events so that they have proceeded at his desired pace.
“He has ensured that those who were stalking the corridors in search of journalists to brief against him have been obliged to issue lengthy statements describing him as the greatest Irishman since Brian Boru,” he said, for which there were chuckles all round and a few side-eyes thrown around the room.
But it was Michael Healy Rae who told the Taoiseach to take it all in his stride. He urged him to kick up his heels and to enjoy his time off with the family. And of course, to make a few more cycle trips along the Ring of Kerry. However, he noted that Kenny may cycle a little slower these days.
The platitudes were drawing to an end, but there was still time for one more contribution.
“Finally, on behalf of the Independent Alliance, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross,” said the Ceann Comhairle.
There were audible, giddy grumbles and laughter heard from the benches, as the politician, who previously called Kenny a “political corpse” in a newspaper column, took to his feet.
“I thank the House for such a warm welcome,” laughed Ross, as did Kenny.
After all, it’s water under the bridge now.
And that was it. A few compliments, a few digs and the sun had finally set on Kenny’s career as Taoiseach.
TDs queue up to shake Enda Kenny's hand in the Dáil.
There was a standing ovation for Kenny as he shook hands with his Cabinet colleagues, before a queue formed on the chamber floor as TDs lined up to wish him well.
The applause continued into the halls outside the chamber.
Surrounded by Leinster House staff, his family, and a number of TDs that had spilled outside the Dáil, he looked over his shoulder, gave another final wave goodbye, and walked away.
Whether Kenny will take up another job or prefer to enjoy his retirement, only time will tell.
Updated 13 June 2017
HE TOOK HIS time, but Enda Kenny has officially resigned as Taoiseach. After much speculation about when it would occur, Kenny made his intentions known last month that he would be stepping down as Fine Gael leader.
He has been acting Taoiseach since then, andtoday marked his final speechin the Dáil.
This clears the way for Minister Leo Varadkar to take his place at the helm of Fine Gael (with Simon Coveney, with whom he battled for leadership, as the former GP’s deputy).
Of course, as the Dáil’s longest-serving TD, it must be difficult for Kenny to let go, sit back and enjoy retirement.
So, it’s no surprise that there has been speculation that he may take up some other high-powered role when he does step aside.
We took a look at some of the jobs he might dust his CV off for…
Prime Minister Theresa May with Taoiseach Enda KennyStefan RousseauStefan Rousseau
Kenny had previously used the issue of Brexit to argue that it was not the right time for him to step down.
His supporters, like Finance Minister Michael Noonan, said Kenny knows the big players in Europe, and has built up relationships with the people Ireland needs to get on side for negotiations.
Kenny had said on a number of occasions that Ireland doesn’t need a Brexit minister as he was taking care of matters in the role of Taoiseach.
As people waited for him to announce that he was stepping down, there was speculation that Kenny should be kept on as Brexit minister.
A poll by The Sunday Business Post found that 60% are opposed to such an idea, but 38% are in favour of such a role for Kenny. The strongest support was among his Fine Gael supporters where 69% agree such a role would be suitable for him.
Just last weekend, Kenny was in touch with British Prime Minister Theresa May, who is preparing for her negotiations with the EU over Brexit.He showed thathe’s not one to keep his opinions to himself, voicing concern about the impending deal between May’s party and the DUP.
A statement on their meeting said that on the subject of Brexit, they noted that negotiations were scheduled to begin later this month, “with the Taoiseach reiterating Irish concerns”.

An Irishman currently holds the job as the Ambassador of the European Union to the United States – so it is not out of the question.
Kenny’s pro-Europe credentialsare well known. His relationship with the US is also pretty good after what was dubbed a successful St Patrick’s Day trip to the White House.
The four-year role is currently held by David O’Sullivan who has served since 2014.
It wouldn’t be the first time a former Taoiseach has been appointed to the position. Kenny’s former boss John Bruton was the EU’s ambassador to Washington from 2004 to 2009.

Kenny has been linked with this job before.
In 2014, having already been linked with the job of European Commission President, his name was being mentioned in reports about who would be the next council President.
His name has come up again recently, as the current president, Donald Tusk, has come in for criticism in his home country, Poland. Despite speculation that he might not stay for another term, European Union leaders confirmed Tusk for a second term as Council president last month.
The president is elected for a2.5 year term, which is renewable once.
So you never know. Maybe next time, Enda?

Kenny might be tempted to return to his pre-politics role.
Prior to his election in 1975, he was a school teacher, but his age (65) might bring a halt to any ambitions to re-enter the classroom.
Although, his recent trip to the US showed that he hasn’t lost his ability to school people on the Irish language….
UK & USA/ YouTube
Kenny’s known to enjoy a cycle around the Ring of Kerry, so you never know, he might be content with spending time with his family, enjoying his retirement, and giving more time to the hobby.
Come to think of it… There are probably more than a few Fine Gael TDs who’d like him to hop onto that saddle and pedal away into the sunset – and sooner, rather than later.

THERE’S NO DELICATE way of saying this, so we’re just going to have to come out with it: Irish people, it’s time to retire our formerly innocent slang term, ‘jizz’.
In older, more pure times, ‘jizz’ was kind of a catch-all term for ‘spirit’, ‘enthusiasm’ or ‘get up and go’ - ’jizz it up’ could be interchanged pretty comfortably with ‘jazz it up’.
Today,for obvious reasons, this does not fly so easily.
Most people will already understand this, of course – but some of our politicians have yet to get the memo, as this wasuttered today in the Dáilby Gerry Adams:

Yeah, Gerry Adams is going to miss Enda Kenny’s jizz. Which is great to know.
Fine Gael’s Gerry O’Connell came out with something similar during the party’s electoral race recently:

Lads, this is just not on in the Year of Our Lord 2017. You can’t say you’re going to miss the former Taoiseach’s ‘jizz’ and expect people to keep a straight face any more.
You'll miss my WHAT?PA Archive / PA ImagesPA Archive / PA Images / PA Images
For quite some time now, this has been causing uncomfortable situations in schools:

And with families.

My mam constantly mixes up the phrase "jazz it up a bit" with "jizz it up a bit". Do I tell her?
So let this be a message to politicians and teachers and grannies and mams across the country: ‘Jizz’ does not mean ‘spirit’ or ‘get up and go’ any more. It’s time to find a new word. Our deepest apologies.

IRISH SOLDIERS FROM the Siege of Jadotville will finally receive bravery medals – almost 56 years after they fought.
The decision was taken at Enda Kenny’s last cabinet meeting today.

In 1961 when the United Nations intervened in the Katanga conflict in the African Congo, a contingent of 155 Irish troops were sent to the Congo on the peacekeeping mission. A Company were sent into Jadotville after a Swedish company pulled out.
Their battle was effectively swept under the carpet and the medals board at the time denied them the honour of being awarded medals.

Today’s decision was made after fifth year pupils at Galway Community College lobbied politicians.
Taoiseach Enda Kenny said, “I am very pleased to announce this decision to award medals to the men of “A” Company.  This fully recognises their bravery and courage during the unique circumstances of the Siege of Jadotville.
‘Just teenagers’
While Commandant Pat Quinlan was 42, the bulk of the troops were just teenagers.Photosof the men before the siege show them with regulation blue helmets askew and rifles in their hands.
Tadhg Quinn was 19 when he fought at Jadotville,he toldTheJournal.iethat they didn’t have enough food, ammunition or water for the siege. At one stage, they were sent jerry cans of water – but they were petrol cans that hadn’t even been cleaned out.

So today really is the last day of Enda Kenny’s long goodbye as Taoiseach.
After 42 years as a TD, 15 as Fine Gael leader, and six as Taoiseach, Kenny has given his final speech to the Dáil.
There were plenty of tributes and kind words (from some benches in the Dáil at least) for Kenny, as well as a standing ovation, after he finished addressing colleagues for the last time.

Enda Kenny on his first election to the Dáil in 1975.Youtube / RTÉYoutube / RTÉ/ RTÉ
Enda Kenny is expected to resign as Taoiseach later today to be replaced by party colleague Leo Varadkar. This piece, which was originally published on 17 May, looks at what he’ll be remembered for.
FROM RELUCTANT TAOISEACH to reluctant ex-Taoiseach, Enda Kenny’s career will go down as a truly exceptional one in Irish politics.
When he took the position in 2011 it was the first time Fine Gael had won power in an election in almost 30 years. His re-election five years later was the first time the party had been returned in its history.
Both these events followed a decade in which Kenny rebuilt a party that had been decimated by the electoral success of Bertie Ahern’s Fianna Fáil.
In short, Kenny delivered for Fine Gael.
Throughout that time however, questions persisted about whether this success was built on Kenny’s stewardship of the party or in spite of it.
Not that his style was ever destructive, but a general attitude towards him amongst the public – that was at best indifferent – often forced Fine Gael into sidelining him come election time.
This internal battle between Kenny as an asset and a liability is one that has been at the centre of his leadership for the past 10 years.
It’s what led to the failed coup against him in the summer of 2010 and it’s ultimately hastened his now-confirmed departure.
Seven years ago, it was the fear that Kenny was the reason for stagnating poll numbers at a time when the economy and Fianna Fáil were in meltdown.
Now, it’s a fear in Fine Gael that the party could be caught out by an election without a new leader in place.
With a steely determination that surprised many, Kenny faced down that first failed heave. This time around, he’s also managed to face down would-be challengers long enough to leave somewhat on his own terms.
Kenny had said repeatedly that he would not lead his party into another election after two stints as Taoiseach, he’s now managed to stay on further into that second term than many had predicted.

Even though Kenny’s political career has defied convention in many ways, its beginnings very much fit the standard mould.
After the death of his father Henry Kenny TD in 1975, Enda Kenny won the subsequent by-election and was elected to be the youngest member of Dáil Éireann.
The elder Kenny was a former All-Ireland winning footballer with Mayo and was also a teacher and principal of a national school in their native Islandeady.
Enda Kenny didn’t reach the heights of his father on the GAA pitch but was nonetheless anaccomplished footballer in his own right. A corner-forward for Islandeady himself, Kenny has also managed and coached the club and has been named as its honorary president for life.
For the first decade after being elected as a TD, Kenny kept a relatively low profile.
He only entered the national political arena when appointed as a Minister of State in Department of Education and Labour by Garret FitzGerald in 1986.
Fine Gael was removed from power in an election the following year but Kenny managed to hold his seat. He was therefore on the party’s frontbench in opposition and consolidated his position as one of its foremost figures.

It was during this period that Kenny married his long-time partner Fionnuala. The pair had met about a decade earlier in the corridors of Leinster House when she was working as part of Fianna Fáil’s press team.
As the first ever female government press secretary, it’s long been said that Fionnuala’s ambition rubbed off on Kenny and it’s certainly true that their marriage coincided with a period of political success for him.
Two years after they married, Kenny helped form the ‘rainbow coalition’ government with Labour and Democratic Left and he became a full minister for the first time in the Department of Tourism.
Following this three-year stint in government for Fine Gael, the party suffered a steep electoral decline and it is during this period that Kenny seized his chance to take the leadership.
Former Taoiseach John Bruton survived as Fine Gael leader until 2001 when Kenny surprised Irish political observers by putting himself as one of the contenders to take over.

Despite being a minister, he had never been regarded to be interested in the top job and his infamous pledge to “electrify” the party failed to convince. Instead, Fine Gael went for Michael Noonan and ploughed head first into an electoral collapse a year later.
The 2002 general election was among the worst in the party’s history and its loss of 23 seats sent it into a wilderness of opposition amid a booming economy.
Fine Gael’s front bench suffered some big casualties but crucially Kenny managed to hang on. In the leadership contest that followed, Kenny won out and took on the daunting task of rebuilding the party.
In the years that followed, Kenny hit the road and was widely praised within the party for the work he did on the ground.

But his public persona remained relatively pedestrian and his first general election as leader in 2007 didn’t really capture the country’s imagination either.
The party’s US-inspired ‘Contract for a Better Ireland’ pledge didn’t really connect with the electorate and he failed to deliver any knockout blows in a TV debate with Bertie Ahern.
It meant the Drumcondra man won his third straight term as Taoiseach.
But the overall result proved to be a blessing in disguise for Kenny. His party closed the gap with Fianna Fail from 50 seats to 26, putting itself in a strong position as the economic storm clouds gathered.

Heave
As the economy began to at first slowly and then very rapidly unravel over the next number of years, Fianna Fáil were forced into implementing successive austerity budgets and the government lurched from crisis to crisis.
But during a time when the Irish public was perhaps more versed in economic matters than it has even been, Kenny’s handle on such matters was being questioned.
It appeared the party had allowed Labour steal a march in opposition and Kenny’s leadership was blamed as the reason why Fine Gael was not benefiting in the polls.

Inan oral history of the 2010 heave previously published onTheJournal.ie, political journalist Deaglán de Breádún told Hugh O’Connell that Kenny’s leadership was coming into focus:
But the haphazard attempts to actually unseat and replace Kenny failed and the disorganisation allowed him to take the initiative in the battle.
As well as publicly sacking Richard Bruton, a TV blitz from the leader and some backroom cajoling from both Kenny and Phil Hogan left the would-be conspirators with nowhere to go.

Kenny’s survival and his decisive actions in seeing off the challenge did a number of things for him.
Firstly, it ensured he’d lead Fine Gael into the coming general election. Secondly, it demonstrated a steely side that perhaps the public needed to see.
Seven months and a €80 billion bailout for Ireland later, Kenny was facing into his second general election as Fine Gael leader. This time, such was the political situation, he was almost certain to be Taoiseach.
Knowing the party was being presented with the biggest open goal an opposition could hope for, Fine Gael seemed determined not to blow its chance.
The frequently ridiculed but ultimately successful ‘Five Point Plan’ message delivered ad nauseam by Kenny during that period will almost certainly be the public’s greatest takeaway of Kenny the campaigner.
In part because it encapsulates a difficulty in connecting with the wider public on any level beyond that of a competent team leader.
But even if it was robotic, it worked. The plan’s focus on economic management came at a time when the Irish public were ready to accept any perceived misgivings – so long as the ship was righted.

In office
Kenny’s first years as Taoiseach were perhaps both bolstered and hampered by the all-seeing eye of the Troika.
The periodic visits here by a joint IMF, ECB and EU delegation became a strange routine that Irish people became used to.
The government walked a tightrope between implementing the agreed austerity and appearing too deferential to Ireland’s bailout masters.
During this period, Kenny took some of the most direct criticism from opposition politicians for not arguing more vociferously for Ireland on the European stage.
This photo of Enda Kenny with then French President Nicolas Sarkozy followed the Taoiseach for years.
The oft-repeated plea to ‘burn the bondholders’ became a frequent political cry each time the Irish State repaid a multi-billionrepayment to unsecured bondholders.
Even the head of the Troika’s mission to Ireland was forced toeventually admit that he felt it was unfairto make Irish taxpayers pay such debts.
But Kenny and his loyal Finance Minister Michael Noonan persisted with this strategy and they will claim success on a number of fronts, foremost of which was thedeparture of Ireland from the Troika programmeitself.
Deals tolengthen the period over which Irelandrepays bank debts and therenegotiation of terms with the Troikawere also heralded to save billions.
Added to this were unemployment figures that have continued to fall and the intangible fact that Kenny’s adherence to EU wishes may have built up credit for Ireland that is now much needed in Brexit negotiations.

But all of this came at a cost. One of the Troika’s stipulations was the introduction of a water charge regime and the issue came to dominate the latter part of Kenny’s first government.
The opposition to water charges became the touchstone issue for the wider opposition to swingeing austerity and Kenny’s government bore the brunt as people took to the streets.
These issues continue to this day.

There were other challenges too.
Early in Kenny’s first term the publication of the Cloyne report detailed and exposed how church authorities had dealt with allegations of abuse in the Cork diocese.
The Taoiseach’s strong response to the report and a Dáil speech in which he directly challenged the Vatican made people stand up and take notice,in Ireland and abroad.
The backbone Kenny had shown in extinguishing the heave against him was transferred to the Dail chamber where the Catholic Church was challenged by a Taoiseach in a manner not seen before.
The Vatican waseven forced to respond to Kenny’s speechand his contribution remains the most powerful he made during his time as leader.

Referendum time
Despite overseeing the introduction of divorce during its previous stint in government, Fine Gael had long been seen as socially conservative.
But Kenny’s first government oversaw a number of significant social changes, one of which bore significant political costs for his party.
While Labour reasonably argues that the impetus for the same-sex marriage referendum can from their side of the coalition, Kenny and Fine Gael were nonetheless active and enthusiastic in ensuring it passed.
Kennyfamously stumbled over a flower pot in 2012as journalists pushed him on his views on same-sex marriage but once the party’s course was set in favour of marriage equality, Kenny was steadfastly behind it.
Some may criticise Kenny’s reticence to support full marriage equality but many world leaders,Barack Obama among them, have spoken about how their view on the issue evolved over time.

While Fine Gael’s support for marriage equality was clear, it was noteworthy that much of the actual campaigning for the Yes vote was driven by LGBT and rights groups rather than political parties.
Referendums are frequently used by voters to tell the government of the day how they feel and there was a sense during the 2015 campaign that advocates and politicians alike were keen to keep the issue to the fore.
Kenny perhaps partly fell victim to this in 2013 when the referendum onabolishing the Seanad was defeated.
The proposal was not a universally loved one by politicians and was very closely associated with Kenny himself. Its defeat left him with a bloody nose that would have been much worse had same-sex marriage not been passed.
Abortion is another social issue that Kenny at least partly dealt with in a way that the governments which preceded him did not.
The passing of the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Act legislated for the Supreme Court decision in the X Case, 21 years after the ruling was made.

Kenny’s determination to proceed with it cost Fine Gael some high-profile parliamentarians and again demonstrated his resolve. Renua, the party that was formed as a direct result of that debate, has also been floundering.
Furthermore, while the ultimate consequence of the Citizens’ Assembly are far from clear, there is at least a momentum that will likely see an abortion referendum next year.
Re-election
As already touched upon, Kenny’s re-election as Taoiseach was historic for his party, but it was far from clearcut.
The public’s electoral judgement on his first term as Taoiseach was to strip the party of 16 seats and to resuscitate Fianna Fáil just one cycle after they’d lashed them at the polls.
Kenny was visibly disappointed on election night and questions over the future of his leadership were splashed over the front pages again.
Again though, demonstrating a doggedness that once seemed alien but now seems characteristic, Kenny proved the doubters wrong

It took four nominations and votes before he was officially returned and electedTaoiseach for the second time.
In the 70 days between that day and the election day, Irish politics was transformed with a deal that saw Fine Gael govern as a minority party with the qualified support of Fianna Fáil.
The judgement on that arrangement is still pending but the one thing that is for sure is that Kenny has presided over it for longer than most expected.
The reluctance of his would-be successors to wield the axe shows both the respect for what he’s achieved and also the knowledge that previous efforts to unseat him have been met with canny resistance.
Such political nous is not what defines one’s legacy, however. The achievements secured as a result of it are.
Time will tell what Kenny presents and claim as his greatest legacy, but a record as Taoiseach of righting the ship when it was most required will surely be part of it.
Whether he did this successfully and fairly is ultimately what others will judge him on.
IT’S BEEN THE Leo and Simon Show over the last few weeks, but in the coming days it will very much be the Leo and Enda Show.
After months of speculation about when Taoiseach Enda Kenny would step aside, he finally made his intentions known last month when he stepped down as Fine Gael leader.
With a new Fine Gael leader now in place, the time has come for Kenny to move on from the office of Taoiseach.
It’s expected that Kenny will announce his resignation as Taoiseach in the Dáil chamber today, clearing the way for Leo Varadkar to be nominated for the position tomorrow.
So, how’s it all going to play out?
It’s understood that Kenny will address the Dáil chamber, formally confirming his resignation.
Leaders from other parties and other TDs may well make contributions (be they good or bad) and wish Kenny well on his next endeavour.
Most likely, normal business of the day will be suspended and adjourned until the next day.
Kenny will then go to Áras an Uachtaráin to meet President Michael D Higgins and ask him to accept his resignation.
Last week, there had been speculation that Kenny would step down and Varadkar could be voted in, all in one day. But it’s understood that in order to give Kenny a good send-off today, the vote has been put off till the next day.
Therefore all the platitudes and congratulatory speeches on Kenny’s tenure will take place today, before Varadkar’s big day tomorrow.
On Wednesday, nominations for the next Taoiseach can be put forward. Due to the makeup of the Dáil, other parties can also put forward their own candidates if they wish (though they would never get the support).

Last year, it took four votes for Enda Kenny to finally be made Taoiseach. With the Independent Alliance group alreadystating that they will support Leo Varadkaras Taoiseach, no surprises are expected and he should get enough votes to be elected the next Taoiseach of Ireland.
Kenny made his Cabinet appointments known the same day he was made Taoiseach last year, but it is unclear if Varadkar will do so.
He may announce his Cabinet reshuffle on Thursday, and even hold off on announcing the junior ministries until Friday, in order to drag the media coverage mileage.
It’s really the new Taoiseach’s prerogative. We’ll just have to wait and see what Varadkar’s reign will bring.
OUTGOING TAOISEACH ENDA Kenny has spoken with British Prime Minister Theresa May, outlining his concerns over her impending deal with the DUP.
In a statement released this afternoon, the Government Press Office said Kenny had spoken to the British leader by phone this morning.
“They discussed the outcome of the UK general election and the Prime Minister outlined the proposed supply and confidence arrangement between her party and the DUP. The Taoiseach indicated his concern that nothing should happen to put the Good Friday Agreement at risk and the challenge that this agreement will bring.
“He also noted the absence of any nationalist voice in Westminster following the election.”
Kenny said that both he and May were of the belief that an executive in the North should be formed as soon as possible. It is now nearly three months since the Northern election and exploratory discussions between parties are set to take place tomorrow.
The statement added that Kenny suggested May should meet Kenny’s successor Leo Varadkar.
“On Brexit, they noted that negotiations were scheduled to begin, as previously planned, later this month, with the Taoiseach reiterating Irish concerns.
“The Taoiseach stated that there should be an early meeting between the Prime Minister and his successor Leo Varadkar and wished her well in the challenges that now lie ahead.”
A spokesperson for 10 Downing Street said:
“The Prime Minister explained that she is working towards a confidence and supply deal with the DUP which would provide stability and certainty for the UK going forward.
“They confirmed their joint commitment to restoring a Northern Ireland Executive as soon as possible and agreed that both countries would continue to engage closely to bring about political stability in Northern Ireland. The Prime Minister reiterated that the Government’s approach and objectives in the forthcoming talks to re-establish the Northern Ireland Executive remained unchanged.
“The two leaders spoke about their willingness to continue close cooperation as the UK embarks on leaving the European Union, with no return to a hard border.”
LEO VARADKAR HAS said he is willing to consider a different approach to secure the freedom of Ibrahim Halawa.
Halawa has spent almost four years in jail without trial. Recently, the Irish governmentsaid it has stepped up its diplomatic effortsto secure his release.
His next trial date is set for Tuesday, 4 July.
In her talks with the new Fine Gael leader, Children’s Minister Katherine Zappone said she wants more to be done.
She said despite the good work by department officials and the Minister for Foreign Affairs Charlie Flanagan, a new approach was needed by the Irish government in order to reach its goal.
Speaking to reporters today, Varadkar said he had a “good discussion” with Zappone on the matter.

Varadkar said he would need to be fully briefed on whatever other approach is agreed upon.
He said he would have to “consider the pluses and minuses of a different approach”.
The Social Protection Minister, who is soon to become the next Taoiseach, said he also needs to ensure that any change in their actions are not “counter productive”.
Updated at 9.05pm
FIANNA FÁIL LEADER Micheál Martin has said he has no reason not to trust Leo Varadkar, adding that his party will abstain in the Dáil vote to make him Taoiseach next week.
Following a meeting with the new Fine Gael leader in Government Buildings today, Martin said he had a “constructive” and “frank” discussion with Varadkar about keeping up the confidence and supply agreement (the deal propping up this government).
There have been hostile exchanges between the Social Protection Minister and Martin in the past, with Varadkar stating that he doesn’t trust Fianna Fáil.
“Leo has said a lot of things in the past, such as ‘not another red cent‘… I didn’t get any of that hostility in the meeting to be frank,” Martin told reporters today.
Varadkar’s now infamous “not another cent” comments were made during the general election in 2011, when he stated that the banks would get no more money from government. A year later Taoiseach Enda Kenny stated that Ireland would not impose losses on bondholders.
“As far as I am concerned I have worked with Enda Kenny the last 12 months in terms of the implementation of the confidence and supply agreement, and on a personal level, I don’t see any issues emerging.
“On a personal level, I have no reason not to trust Leo Varadkar and I go into these meetings in good faith. We don’t know each other that personally, but we are two pragmatic, professional politicians. We want to see things done for the country,” said the Fianna Fáil leader.
“We read things in the media and I think Leo has said things he clearly regrets… but I don’t anticipate any of those issues arising,” he added.

Move to right for Fine Gael?
With Varadkar using lines that he wants to represent “people who get up early in the morning”, there has been a lot of talk since his election as leader that he may take the party down a more right-wing route.
When asked byTheJournal.ieif this is a concern to the Fianna Fáil party, Martin said:

He said Fianna Fáil continues to be a party that promotes “fairness and decency”.
“We will always be, as we have historically been, a party very rooted in terms of the community and people… and [ensure] people get their chance in life regardless of the background they come from.”
At aged 38, Varadkar is the youngest Fine Gael leader in history.
Martin was asked if he feels old facing down the new leader at age 56.
“I don’t feel old at all,” he replied, firmly adding that he will be leading Fianna Fáil into the next election.
Asking independents for their support
Varadkar has had a busy day today, meeting not only Martin, but other independent TDs and ministers who he hopes will support him in the vote to be Taoiseach next week.
Communications Minister Denis Naughten, Children’s Minister Katherine Zappone and Rural Independent TD Dr Michael Harty met with the new Fine Gael leader for over an hour this afternoon to set out their stall.
Speaking following the meeting, a spokesperson for Zappone said the minister and her colleagues had “over two hours of professional discussions on national issues” with Varadkar.
Zappone raised a number of key issues related to her Department, the spokesperson said.
Among these were a need to build on a radical new approach to childcare. Zappone also outlined new approaches she felt could be taken to secure the release of Irish citizen Ibrahim Halawa who in imprisoned in Egypt.
Zappone’s spokesperson said she “welcomes Minister Varadkar’s willingness to consider these”.
She also proposed a process in relation to repealing the Eighth Amendment which would see the wording of a referendum and legislative options developed in tandem with the work of the Oireachtas Committee.
Halawa has spent almost four years in jail and the Irish government has said it has stepped up its diplomatic efforts in recent times to secure his release.
His next trial date is set for Tuesday, 4 July.

Despite the good work by department officials and the Minister for Foreign Affairs Charlie Flanagan, Zappone said the Irish government has not reached its goal, and she wants efforts stepped up.
Dr Michael Harty,who has previously put the government on noticethat he might withdraw support for government, said next week’s vote is a very different situation compared to when he voted for Enda Kenny to be Taoiseach last May.
“My vote was to create a government… this is a different occasion where we are changing the leader of Fine Gael,” he said.

Harty said he has a lot of issues with the implementation of the programme for government, particularly when it comes to rural affairs.
“I would be expecting a lot from Leo Varadkar on that,” he added, highlighting that he wants to see action on balancing regional development as well as the unraveling of the post office network around Ireland.
Following today’s meeting Varadkar said:
Yesterday, Varadkar met with members of the Independent Alliance, with another meeting scheduled with the group this weekend.
While a vote to elect the next Taoiseach was expected to take place in the Dáil next Tuesday, it is now mooted to take place on Wednesday to ensure Enda Kenny has a satisfactory send-off from his colleagues.
Updated at 10.55pm
FINE GAEL LEADER Leo Varadkar and members of the Independent Alliance had a ’very constructive and very satisfactory’ meeting this evening.
A spokesperson for Varadkar – who won the Fine Gael leadership contest last week – said that the meeting had been positive and constructive.
They said that a wide-ranging discussion was held which lasted for an hour-and-a-half and “focused on how to make further progress on commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government”.
“Particular issues discussed included legislation to prioritise, matters which will be fast tracked, and where free votes will apply,” the spokesperson said.
They said that Varadkar would now discuss the particular issues raised with the relevant ministers and meet again with the Independent Alliance before the weekend.
The Independent Alliance said the meeting was constructive and satisfactory.
The group said that they had stressed the need to accelerate various pieces of recent legislation as negotiated in the Programme for Government.
Among the issues discussed included Brexit, rural affairs and infrastructure.
Coveney
Earlier, housing minister Simon Coveney said he would “hope and expect” health minister Simon Harris to remain at Cabinet following any reshuffle.
Coveneyfailed in his bidto be the next Taoiseach last Friday, with Varadkar winning the leadership contest by a 60:40 margin.
There has been much speculation over the weekend that TDs that supported Coveney would find themselves out in the cold, with questions being raised about the future of the Health Minister, Simon Harris.
However, Coveney toldCork 96FM’s Opinion Lineprogramme today that he has made it clear to Varadkar that the careers of his supporters should not suffer.
When asked if he thought Harris’ career had been damaged for joining the Coveney camp, he replied:
Coveney does carry some clout with the new leader and the party, with over 65% of Fine Gael party members voting for the housing minister to become the next party leader. Therefore, his opinion is not one that can be ignored.

Simon and Leo meeting
Coveney said he met with Varadkar on Saturday and discussed the future make up of the government for over an hour and a half, according to the Cork TD, who said he had subsequently talked again with Varadkar over the phone.
While there has been talk that Coveney may be appointed Tánaiste, he would not be drawn on the issue today, stating that his conversations with the new Fine Gael leader must remain confidential.
However, he did state that he would be happy to remain on in the Housing Department if that is where he is most needed.
When asked if he would like to stay on in the brief,  he said:
While Coveney admitted that he is disappointed with the result, he said he has always said he will work with Varadkar to unify the party.

‘Not someone that mopes around’
“I am realist. I don’t like losing. I wanted to be Taoiseach and that didn’t work out. I am moving on, I am not someone who mopes around,” he said.
The Cork TD said he respects the decision of the party, adding that he is not the type of person who would go out to damage his opponent.
Since Friday’s result, Coveney said he has been encouraging those that supported him not to be bitter, but to be constructive towards the party.
Drumming up support
With the Dáil on a break this week, the new Fine Gael leader has a number of meetings planned to firm up his support before next Tuesday’s vote to make him the next Taoiseach of Ireland.
Varadkar’s is meeting with members of the Independent Alliance this evening was in order to ensure that he has their vote.
In a press conference recently, Transport Minister and Independent Alliance member, Shane Ross said they would not seek to renegotiate the programme for government, but said they would be looking for some aspects to be delivered sooner rather than later.
It’s understood Independent Alliance members expect to stay in their ministerial positions, as does Children’s Minister Katherine Zappone and Communications Minister Denis Naughten.

Where Varadkar may face difficulties are with the other Independents.
In order to be elected Taoiseach next week, he will need the backing of the Independents and the abstention of Fianna Fáil. In total, he will need the support of at least 58 TDs.
Last May, Enda Kenny was elected Taoiseach by 59 votes.
These included his Fine Gael party members, Independent Alliance TDs, Katherine Zappone and Denis Naughten, as well as rural Independent Clare TD Dr Michael Harty and Tipperary TD Michael Lowry.
Other independent TDs such as Maureen O’Sullivan, Noel Grealish, Michael Healy-Rae and Michael Fitzmaurice abstained.
Talks with Fitzmaurice faltered at the last hour during government formationtalks last year. Today, he said he would not be supporting Varadkar as Taoiseach.

The Roscommon-Galway TD said a number of important issues that were agreed in the programme for government have not been delivered upon, adding that he would have taken the same decision had Simon Coveney won the contest.
The division between rural and urban is a matter of concern for another independent TD, Dr Michael Harty.
In May, he said he wanted to “put the government on notice” that he willwithdraw his support for itif it doesn’t guarantee the future of the post office network.
The Clare TD reiterated his point onRTÉ’s Late Debate radio programme last week, where he said that the government had not followed through with its commitments on post offices as agreed with independent TDs. He is expected to meet with Varadkar tomorrow.
A vote to elect the next Taoiseach is expected to take place in the Dáil next Tuesday.

Kenny was straight back to business yesterday morning, where he delivered two speeches, the first at the Chicago Council for Global Affairs and the second to business leaders at the Ocean Cut restaurant to mark the opening of Enterprise Ireland’s new Chicago office.
During a discussion at the Chicago Council, Kenny expressed his disappointment at US President Donald Trump’s stance on the Paris agreement.
The decision to pull out of the climate deal was “disappointing to put it lightly,” he said,according to RTÉ- adding that you couldn’t “ignore the accuracy of scientific facts”.
The main focus of Kenny’s trip is the links between Ireland and America.
Kenny announced a referendum to grant Irish citizens abroad the right to vote in Irish presidential elections, last March.
He emphasised the importance of bringing the undocumented Irish living in America “out of the shadows”.

THE WEB SUMMIT has announced that MoneyConf, a financial services and fintech conference, will be held in Dublin.
This year’s conference is kicking off in Madrid, Spain today.
The Web Summit moved to Lisbon in 2016 after being held in the Irish capital for a number of years.
When the move to Portugal was announced in 2015,email correspondence between government officials and organisersof the tech conference revealed how the relationship deteriorated as the event’s founder raised concerns about traffic management, public transport, hotel costs and WiFi at the RDS.
This morning, Web Summit co-founder and CEO Paddy Cosgrave announced that MoneyConf would be held in Dublin.

Updated 6.25pm
BRITISH, IRISH AND world leaders have condemned last night’s terror attack in central London, reacting with both outrage and solidarity.
Seven peopledied as a result of the attackand dozens more were injured, some seriously.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the incident was “a deliberate and cowardly attack on innocent Londoners and visitors to our city enjoying their Saturday night,” adding: “There is no justification whatsoever for such barbaric acts.”
Speaking outside No 10 Downing Street this morning, British Prime Minister Theresa May said: “We cannot and must not pretend that things can continue as they are, things need to change…
May said the three terrorist attacks the UK has experienced in the last three months – two in London and one in Manchester – are not connected but highlight a new trend, noting: “Terrorism breeds terrorism.”
She described the ideology of Islamist extremism behind the attacks is a “perversion of Islam” and said defeating it is “one of the great challenges of our time”.
As a mark of respect, the main political parties are suspending general election campaigning today. However, May said campaigning will resume tomorrow and the election will go ahead as planned on Thursday, adding that attacks like this cannot disrupt the democratic process.
Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn tweeted about the “brutal and shocking incidents” and thanked the emergency services who responded.

Ireland’s Foreign Affairs Minister Charlie Flanagan also condemned the “cowardly and barbaric attacks”.
“We continue to closely monitor the situation. Anyone who has serious concerns about loved ones in London can contact my Department in Dublin on 01 408 2000, or the Irish Embassy in London on 00 44 207 235 2171.”
The Irish Embassy in London is monitoring the situation, but it’s not believed any Irish people were caught up in the attack.
‘Important to be prepared’
Fine Gael leader and Minister for Social Protection Leo Varadkar has indicated he intends to establish a Cabinet-level committee on national security similar to the Cobra committee in the UK, which deals with major crises such as terrorism.
Ireland’s security status has not changed but a spokesperson for Varadkar said:
The new committee would allow greater ministerial involvement in preparing for and managing major security threats, and more extensive cross-departmental cooperation on these issues.
Varadkar said the fact the London attack came so soon after the Manchester bombing “only adds to the horror”.

“Once again innocent people have been targeted in the most craven  and horrific manner. We extend our solidarity  to the people of the UK and condemn this incident in the strongest possible terms,” Varadkar said.
Speaking onRTÉ Radio’s This Week, Flanagan said an attack is “unlikely” to happen in Ireland, but we must remain vigilant.
Flanagan said he is “absolutely confident that the Garda Siochána, at every level, are fully in control of the situation here, the sharing of the intelligence internationally and obviously securing the State here from a national perspective”.
Foreign Affairs Minister Charlie FlanaganLeah Farrell / RollingNews.ieLeah Farrell / RollingNews.ie / RollingNews.ie
He said Ireland will continue to work with Britain and other European countries in tackling violent extremism.
“It’s absolutely essential that we use every possible resource to cover every possible angle, and cyber security is of course an issue and this was an issue that was discussed at the most recent meeting of the National Security Committee.
“We have an ongoing review of strategy, our national strategy. Our international engagement does not remain static or constant, but it is reviewed on an ongoing basis across a range of government departments and we’re very much on top of things here.”
In a statement released this morning, Taoiseach Enda Kenny said: “We utterly condemn the cowardly attack in London last night and reject the warped motives and world view behind them. This is sheer madness.
“Ireland will continue to work exceptionally closely with the UK and all of our colleagues on security matters and prevention as far as possible. ”

The attack was also condemned by Tánasite and Justice Minister Frances Fitzgerald, who said: ”Last night’s attack in London is another depraved and cowardly attack on innocent people. Our first thoughts are with the families of those killed and with the injured victims.
In a statement, President Michael D Higgins said: “This latest terrible attack in London will be rightly condemned by all those who believe in the rights of our public to live their lives in the public space.
The attack was condemned across the political spectrum, with Fianna Fáil leader describing it as “a callous attack on people who were simply enjoying life”, while Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said: “I offer my sincere condolences to the victims and the families of those killed and injured and to the people of London.”

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said: “We are united in terror and sadness, but just as decisively … In the fight against all forms of terrorism, we stand firmly and decisively at the side of Great Britain.”
Leaders from around the world tweeted statements about the attack, including First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon, French President Emmanuel Macron, Canadian President Justin Trudeau, European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and New Zealand Prime Minister Bill English.

TAOISEACH ENDA KENNY will travel to the United States today for a two-day trade and investment mission in Chicago.
His Department said the primary focus of the trip is to promote Ireland as a location for investment, trade and tourism and to support the growth of Irish companies in Illinois.
He will address the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, which brings together political and business leaders to discuss key global issues.
He’s expected to communicate Ireland’s priorities in the context of Brexit and emphasise Ireland’s strong commitment to EU membership and to free trade.
Tomorrow Kenny will meet Irish community leaders and members of the diaspora and Chicago Mayor, Rahm Emanuel, while on Tuesday, he will meet with representatives of the Chicago Irish Immigrant Support Centre and address a Tourism Ireland event.
Commenting on his programme, the Taoiseach said, “My visit to Chicago is an opportunity to support the growth of Irish companies in Illinois and further deepen our commercial links with the US.

This post was first published on 19 May. It has been republished – with minor edits – on the occasion of Leo Varadkar’s election as the new leader of Fine Gael on 2 June 2017.
IT SEEMS AS though Leo Varadkar was destined to work in medicine.
His mother Miriam, from Dungarvan in Waterford, was working as a nurse in England when she met his Mumbai-born father Ashok, a doctor.
The pair had settled in Dublin before Leo, the youngest of three children, was born in 1979.
Varadkar attended St Francis Xavier National School and The King’s Hospital in Dublin, before studying medicine at Trinity College and qualifying as a GP.
Destined to be a doctor perhaps, but is he also destined to be Taoiseach?
Varadkar was an active Young Fine Gael member in college, serving as chair of the Youth of the European People’s Party (of which Fine Gael is a member in the European Parliament) at one point.
A young Varadkar in 1999 campaigning for Simon Coveney, now his rival to lead the partyIrish Election LiteratureIrish Election Literature
His rise through the ranks of Fine Gael was relatively swift.
The then-medical student contested the local elections in 1999 in the Mulhuddart area of Dublin. He failed to be elected but was co-opted to Fingal County Council for the Castleknock area in 2003, serving as deputy mayor.
In 2004, he received the highest first-preference vote in the country in the local elections, getting almost 5,000 votes on the first count.
After securing a Dáil seat in the Dublin West constituency in the 2007 general election, he became the party’s spokesperson for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.
‘You know where you stand with him’
Fine Gael councillor and current deputy mayor of Fingal County Council Eithne Loftus toldTheJournal.ieshe’s “not surprised” by how quickly Varadkar has risen through the ranks of the party.
“I’m not at all surprised, he’s a very, very smart man. The country needs someone of his stature to lead.
“I have watched him grow since he became our local representative here and have seen his ability and general concern for the job that he does.
“I’ve nothing against Simon Coveney, we are very lucky to have so many people who are capable of doing the job of leader, but on this occasion I think Leo is the better option.”
A flyer from the 2007 general electionIrish Election LiteratureIrish Election Literature
Fond of speaking his mind, a somewhat rare trait in Irish politics, Varadkar is never far from the headlines. Some view his straight talking as refreshing, but others think it’s his Achilles’ heel – something prone to landing him in hot water.
Despite her praise for Varadkar, Loftus admits they haven’t always seen eye to eye.
“We would have disagreed on numerous things but certainly you knew exactly where you stood with him. I prefer someone to give me the truth and speak his mind.”
The failed heave
One of the notable times Varadkar spoke his mind was when he was on the wrong side of a failed heave against Enda Kenny as Fine Gael leader in 2010.
During a Prime Time interview at the time, Varadkar explained why he was backing Richard Bruton over Kenny. He drew inspiration for his answer from a Hillary Clintonpresidential campaign adin 2008.
Taoiseach Enda/ YouTube
Varadkar said Kenny had built up the party “brilliantly” over the previous eight years.
However, the then Enterprise Spokesperson said the second thing the leader of the Opposition has to do is “convince the people that he can serve as their Taoiseach”.
“Unfortunately, over the last eight years, and it’s not just one opinion poll, Enda Kenny hasn’t been able to do that. And it’s not that I’ve lost confidence in him, it’s that the public doesn’t have confidence in him. And unfortunately that’s the truth and it’s something that we all know, it’s something that you know.
Despite backing Bruton, Varadkar was one of those not cast aside from the front bench when Kenny, now Fine Gael’s longest-serving Taoiseach, fought off the heave.
Speaking toTheJournal.iepreviously about that period, Varadkar’s fellow rebel MEP Brian Hayes said: “Leo [Varadkar] had done his own sort of polling in his constituency … He said he was absolutely certain that Kenny should go but was not certain – and he pointed at Richard [Bruton] – ‘that you’re the solution’. I thought it was brilliant.
“Richard kind of blushed and said: ‘Sure that’s it, but it’s me or nothing.’”
When Kenny appointed a new frontbench the following month some of the rebels were saved but given different portfolios, including Varadakar and Simon Coveney (now the Housing Minister and his rival for the top job).
Back in 2015, Fine Gael’s former Director of Organisations and Strategy Frank Flannery told this publication: “Guys like Leo and Simon were kept on. These were very key events and allowed the party to move on as if it hadn’t happened.”
‘Poison chalice’
When Fine Gael formed a coalition government with Labour in 2011, Varadkar was appointed Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.
A Cabinet reshuffle in 2014 saw him moved to the Department of Health, perhaps a role more suited to the doctor.
However, health is often dubbed the most difficult seat at the Cabinet table – given the constant battle with waiting lists, hospital trolleys and lack of resources.

Brian Cowen, himself a former Taoiseach, who served as Health Minister as part of Bertie Ahern’s Fianna Fáil government in the late 1990s famously compared the portfolio to Angola, in terms of how many ‘bombs’ one has to defuse no bombs when at the helm.
Speaking aboutthe appointment at the time, Varadkar himself said: “I’m not sure if I’m able to turn the poison chalice into sweet wine, but I’ll do all that I can to improve our health services.”
In the end, he only served as Health Minister for 22 months – a relatively short period in such a vast portfolio.
As the Oireachtas is currently looking to develop a 10-year plan for the health service, Varadkar’s stint seems a bit ‘blink and you’ll have missed it’. His appointment to the Department of Social Protection (DSP) last year was seen as a lateral move by many, including Varadkar himself.
Speaking onRTÉ radioin 2016, he said: “I’m in some way sorry to be leaving Health.
He said his redeployment to the DSP wasn’t a demotion, but “may well be a sideways move”.
The department’s ongoing ‘Welfare Cheats Cheat Us All’ campaign, which encourages people to report others who they suspect of committing social welfare fraud, has been making headlines recently.
Measures in the new Social Welfare Bill include the quarterly publication of the names, addresses and penalties incurred bypeople convicted of welfare fraud, and the potential to reduce the amount a person can receive in social welfare benefits if they’ve been convicted of fraud.
Varadkar and KennySasko Lazarov / RollingNews.ieSasko Lazarov / RollingNews.ie / RollingNews.ie
The move was welcomed by some but others were critical. Bernadette Gorman, a former social welfare inspector, described it as “a hate campaign”.
Speaking on RTÉ’sToday with Seán O’Rourkethis week, Gorman, who has been involved with the DSP for 30 years said: “I don’t like where the department is going. I do think Leo Varadkar was on some sort of solo run but I don’t know what his officials were doing allowing it.”
Gorman said, from her experience investigating welfare claims, “complex human stories” rather than conscious fraud are often behind welfare rules being broken. She added that she believes the plan is “all about his own bid to become leader [of Fine Gael]“.
Fianna Fáil’s Willie O’Dea said the campaign is “both a gross misrepresentation of the actual levels of fraud perpetrated against his department and an attempt to curry favour with significant right wing element of the Fine Gael organisation”, comparing Varadkar to Margaret Thatcher.
Varadkar has said the new rules will act as a deterrent to crack down on welfare fraud.
When announcing the campaign in April, he said:
Reports of suspected fraud have increased significantly since the campaign was launched. However, there have only been 11 cases of suspected fraud so far this year, according to the department’s own figures.
Last year, the DSP made €41 million in overpayments due tocustomer fraud in 16,225 cases– a decline on the €49 million paid out in 2015 in 21,407 cases of customer fraud.
When Varadkar spoke about seeking to revamp the country’s social welfare system when appointed minister, people saw that as him throwing his hat into the leadership ring.
At the time, Varadkar said he was “waiting on the day I sit on toilet and someone says it’s part of a leadership strategy”.
*That* interview
For a person not afraid to talk on most topics, Varadkar was – like most Irish politicians – reticent to talk about his personal life.
It made an interview withMiriam O’Callaghan on RTÉ Radio 1in January 2015 all the more noteworthy.
On that morning, he publicly came out as gay.
He said part of the reason to go public was his new role as Health Minister, as issues such as surrogacy and the ban on gay or bisexual men donating blood now came under his remit.
“I just want people to know that, whatever decisions are made on any issue, I’ll make them according to what I believe is in the public interest and my own conscience. I won’t be allowing my own background or my own sexual orientation to dictate the decisions that I make,” he told O’Callaghan.
Julien Behal / MaxwellsJulien Behal / Maxwells / Maxwells
Undeniably, the announcement was significant. It took place four months before the referendum on marriage equality – which, of course, passed – and made Varadkar one of a few openly gay members of the Oireachtas.
No, a person’s sexual orientation does not impact on their ability to do a job, but having an openly gay leader of the country would show far Ireland has come in the two decades since homosexuality was decriminalised here.
To some, there was another part of the interview that was more surprising than him coming out. Miriam Lord noted in the Irish Times that Varadkar “shocked the political establishment by telling RTÉ’s Miriam O’Callaghan that ‘a politician should trust people with the truth’. Then he shocked the nation by revealing that he is still only 36 years old.”
Indeed, his quick rise through the ranks of Fine Gael means he’s younger than many of his peers at the Cabinet table.
All to play for
Opinion polls – although we’ve learned they can’t always be trusted – generally gave Varadkar the edge over Coveney very early in the leadership race.
Today, the final results showed Coveney won the backing of 65% of Fine Gael’s grassroots members, but Varadkar took the victory after securing significant support among local representatives and the parliamentary party.
The two main players: Coveney and VaradkarSam Boal / RollingNews.ieSam Boal / RollingNews.ie / RollingNews.ie
The final count, including all three electoral colleges, saw him win with 60% to Coveney’s 40%. The electoral college breakdown was as follows:
Fine Gael’s parliamentary party consists of 50 TDs, 19 senators and four MEPs.
How they voted in the leadership contest accounted for 65% of the outcome, while the votes of ordinary members made up 25% and councillors’ votes just 10%.
‘Who wants to lead the Opposition?’
When asked byTheJournal.iein January 2015 if he wanted to lead Fine Gael, Varadkar, who had just been appointed Health Minister, said he didn’t know.
“Ask me that maybe in four or five years time. Now, at the moment, absolutely, definitely not … It’s the last thing on my mind at the moment, particularly with the job I have at the moment, trying to get a handle on the health service. I really want to get stuck into that.
It’s only been two years, but he has just given hisfirst speechand press conference as Fine Gael leader, nodding to the fact that he is soon to become Taoiseach.
“When my father travelled [to Ireland]… I doubt he ever dreamed that his son would one day grow up to become its leader and despite his differences, his son would be treated the same and judged by his actions and character, and not by his ardents and identity,” he said.
The 38-year-old earlier said that people around the world look to Ireland and are reminded that this isn’t a country where it matters where you come from, “but rather where you want to go”.
However, he may not have a lot of time to get comfortable in this new top spot. A general election could happen sooner rather than later and could see Fine Gael return to the opposition benches.
During the same interview withTheJournal.iein 2015, Varadkar was asked if he wanted to be Taoiseach. His response? “You’d hardly want to be leader of the opposition. Who would want to do that?”
TODAY, THE FINE Gael party chooses its successor to Enda Kenny. When the dust settles, it is highly likely that Simon Coveney or Leo Varadkar will become the next Taoiseach.
Varadkar jumped toan early lead among his fellow TDsand it looks like Coveney has a mountain to climb.
In recent days, however, his camp has claimed that some TDshave secretly switched from Varadkar to the Cork South Central TD.
TDs aren’t the only ones who decide however, with MEPs, senators, some 235 councillors and 21,000 party members eligible to cast a ballot.
So how does it all work? And when will we know who won?
Councillors and party members have been voting all week, but it is TDs who cast their votes today.
This will take place at Leinster House between 8am and 12pm this morning. All ballots cast are secret so it is feasible that some could switch from their public allegiance to another candidate at the last minute.
All votes cast will then be brought to the Round Room at Dublin’s Mansion House at Dawson Street where they will be counted.
Each vote will be verified and checked by national returning officer Gerry O’Connell, who is chairman of the Fine Gael executive council.
The 73 members of the parliamentary party, encompassing TDs, senators and MEPs, will account for 65% of the overall vote.
With Varadkar boasting such a strong lead here, Coveney is well and truly up against it to make up the numbers.
The 21,000 party members account for 25% of the vote, while councillors make up the final 10%.
The results will be announced by O’Connell.
In a bid to ramp up the tension, the results will be announced in stages. First, the party members’ result will be declared, followed by the councillors.
Lastly, the decision from the parliamentary party will be announced before the final declaration.
It is expected that a decision will be declared in the mid-afternoon, with expectations that the vote will be declared by 6pm at the latest.
What next?
Whoever becomes Fine Gael leader does not automatically become Taoiseach. For the next few days, at the very least, Enda Kenny will remain Taoiseach.
The next task for Coveney and Varadkar will be to hold talks with those propping up the minority government to convince them to continue supporting it under their leadership.
The Independent Alliance, which holds several ministerial positions, will need to support the victor, while Fianna Fáil will need to continue its confidence and supply agreement with Fine Gael, if the new leader is to be elected Taoiseach.
The Dáil sits again on Tuesday but, depending on the stance taken by the other parties, we may have to wait a little while longer before a new Taoiseach is elected.
Whoever wins, either man would become the youngest ever Taoiseach.
When asked what advice he would have for his successor at his final appearance at Leaders’ Questions, Enda Kenny recalled a Latin phrase: “Illegitimi non carborundum” which translates as “don’t let the bastards get you down” (He also said it in Irish).
AFTER PLEDGES OF allegiances, hustings and the odd dig or two, today is D-day for the Fine Gael party.
Today either Simon Coveney or Leo Varadkar will succeed Enda Kenny and become the next leader of the party, and in turn, the next Taoiseach.
Over the past two weeks, they two men have been grilled on issues such as, taxation, health, housing and Trump.
While it is of course important to question the possible future leaders on the serious issues, we also want them to give answers to some of life’s most pressing issues.
When Enda Kenny stopped byTheJournal.ieoffices in 2015, we put a few of those dilemmas to him.
We thought it only fair that we hear Coveney and Varadkar’s views – just so we know where each are coming from.
Turns out they are divided on a few things, other than policy.

ENDA KENNY divvied out some advice to his successor during his final appearance at Leaders’ Questions today.
With the election of a new Fine Gael leader taking place on Friday, a new Taoiseach should be in place in the second week in June.
When asked what advice he would give to the next leader, Kenny recalled a Latin phrase: ”Illegitimi non carborundum” which translates as “don’t let the bastards get you down” (He also said it in Irish).
Kenny’s last day in the hot seat
TDs were keen to remind Kenny that today was his last day in the hot seat, with Rural Independent TD Noel Grealish channelling Late Late Show interview-style questions, asking the Taoiseach:
“What do you consider your greatest achievements, and also your biggest regrets?”
With the backbenches giggling, the Taoiseach said:
He also said he had no regrets in promoting the two Fine Gael leadership candidates, Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney, to ministry positions.
Describing them as “two fine young men”, Kenny clearly hasn’t forgotten the heaveof 2010where both Varakdar and Coveney played a role in the attempt to topple him, a move orchestrated by the now Education Minister Richard Bruton.
However, there were no hard feelings, it seems.
Whoever wins the Fine Gael contest, Kenny says they had better have an optimistic and positive outlook.
“There is no point looking like you are being weighed down with the problems of the world… we deal with them head on.”
Whoever the next Taoiseach may be, Kenny said he just wants them to always act in the interests of the people of Ireland.
As Fine Gael members vote for their new leader this week, today could possibly be Enda Kenny’s last Leaders’ Questions as Taoiseach.

“One of my saddest days was when our sovereignty was taken from us and the call was ‘send them home’ – well they’re gone,” Kenny tells the Sinn Féin leader.
“If we’d followed your line I dread to think where we’d be now,” he says.
Clare Daly says she is conscious that it his last day taking Leaders’ Questions.
She says there will be a stain on his record over how he has handled the Garda scandals. Daly says it not too late to take action.
She says she got information from the Medical Bureau on Road Safety through FOI that each breath test machine had a running total of the amount of tests done and those numbers were sent back to each station.
She lists a number of other issues, and such as the claim of the missing phones.
“To lose one phone is careless, to lose two smacks of perverting the course of justice,” she tells the Dáil chamber.
“Come on, it has gone too far — that is a sackable offence,” she tells the Taoiseach.
Kenny says he is not sure whether the reports about the missing phones is true and says the Charleton Commission will find out the truth behind these allegations.
Daly says Kenny is an intelligent man, which is why she thinks he is being obtuse now.
“It is actually going to stain your legacy, and I feel bad for that,” Daly tells Kenny.
Judge Charleton is not going to be misled, says Kenny.
Noel Grealish is up now and says sometimes he wondered how the Taoiseach kept up with it all with such energy.
He says he could be back here if the wheels come off the Fine Gael leadership contest.
He know wants to know what his greatest achievements are regrets are.
What are the main challenges to face the new leadership?he asks.
“That is a pretty novel questions, for the day that’s in it,” says the Ceann Comhairle.
“How long have I got?” asks the Taoiseach.
I have no regrets having appointed young Simon and Leo,” says Kenny.
“They might not have been friends on mine when my friend Richard took to the field.”
He says he is happy for it to move on to a younger generation and just wants the next leader to always act in the interests of the people of Ireland.
As of regrets, I don’t have any.
He says the next leader “better be optimistic”.
“There is no point looking like you are being weighed down with the problems of the world – we deal with them head on.”
Kenny then speaks in Latin. Oh…

THE PAST TWO nights have seen the Fine Gael leadership contest step up a gear with the first hustings between Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney.
Coveney hit out at Varadkar over just how long the Minister for Social Protection had been laying the groundwork for contest.
“I don’t think it’s such a bad thing in politics to be prepared,” Varadkar told the crowd,
Shortly after, Coveney followed up this comment:
Varadkar came back with a brief and to-the-point answer:
However, information filed with the IEDR – the organisation with manages the ownership of .ie domains – reveals the website used for Varadkar’s campaign was created before then.
CampaignForLeo.iewas registered on 5 September 2016, the records show, some five months before Enda Kenny announced he planned to step down.

This website offers policy documents, information about Varadkar and his background,  as well as other campaign material.
LeoVaradkar.ie, the website used previously by the Minister, now redirects to the CampaignForLeo.ie site.
An email address attached to the domain began issuing press releases to this publication on 18 May, although it is possible other @campaignforleo.ie addresses were active before this time.
The first activity on the site to be recorded by the Wayback Machine, a website dedicating to archiving the web, was the following day on 19 May.
Is this an indication that the wheels began to slowly move on Varadkar’s campaign as far back as five months before he said they did? Not so, according to a spokesperson for the campaign.
They toldTheJournal.iethat the creation of the domain was part of a move to create consistency across Varadkar’s online presence.

They said use of the slogan dates back to 2007, adding that the Minister’s two other main online outlets – Facebook and Twitter – both have @CampaignForLeo as their usernames (as seen above), the latter being active as far back as the end of 2010.
However, despiteLeoVaradkar.iebeing registered in 2007, it was only decided to switch the website to Campaign For Leo brand recently.

“It makes perfect sense” to keep this uniform, they said, and stressed that the creation of the domain in September was not connected to the Varadkar’s preparation for the leadership contest.
The suggestion that website was created at a time when the leadership contest was starting to appear on the horizon was dismissed as “codology”.
The contest began in earnest on May 17, when Enda Kenny announced he was stepping down as Taoiseach, but there had been rumblings of that taking place for months, if not years.
Almost a year ago in June 2016, it was speculated that might set out a timeline for his departure at a parliamentary party meeting after growing unrest among backbench TDs that month, but he kept tight-lipped.
Now it’s out in the open, and things are heating up between the two candidates, both long seen as potential successors to Enda Kenny.
The next hustings takes place this evening in Ballinasloe, Co Galway.
FINE GAEL HAS overtaken Fianna Fáil for the first time since the general election last year, according to the latest Irish Times/Ipsos MRBI opinion poll.
When people were asked who they would vote for in a general election, 30% of people supported Fine Gael (up two points compared to the last poll in February), while Fianna Fáil came in at 27% (down two points).
Labour received 5% of support, while Sinn Féin received 20% and Independents/Others came in at 18%. Undecided voters were excluded from the above.
The poll findings offer a boost to Fine Gael as the party prepare to elect its new leader. Outgoing Taoiseach Enda Kenny’s personal rating has seen a surge since he announced his departure.
Kenny’s personal satisfaction rating has increased from 31% to 43%, the highest rating he has achieved in almost six years.
The Government’s rating also improved, with 37% of voters saying they are satisfied with it. 55% per cent said they are dissatisfied.
The poll also shows a rating increase for Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, up by two points to 39%. Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams also received a two point increase, up to 31%.
Meanwhile, the opinion poll showed that Simon Coveney has taken the lead on Leo Varadkar in the race for the party leadership among Fine Gael voters and voters in the general public.
48% of Fine Gael voters chose Coveney when asked their preferred choice for leader of the party, while 44% chose Varadkar. 8% of voters were undecided. The sample of solely Fine Gael voters is smaller than that of the national sample, leading to a larger margin of error.
A total of 42% of all voters said they would prefer to see Coveney as leader of Fine Gael, with 37% opting for Varadkar. One in five voters (21%) said they didn’t know.
Varadkar takes the lead in Dublin with 44% support, in Leinster and among wealthier voters.
Meanwhile, Coveney is the preferred candidate among less well-off voters, older voters, farmers and voters outside Leinster, where 56% would vote for him.
When asked a round of questions about the candidates’ strengths, voters prefer Coveney on trust, believing he is “more in touch with ordinary people”.
Varadkar is favoured to “deliver real change”.
The result comes as the pair prepare to head into their second day of hustings debates, which began last night in Dublin.
Three more hustings will take place over the weekend in Carlow, Ballinasloe and Cork.
The poll was conducted on Tuesday and Wednesday this week, using a sample of 1,200 voters aged 18 and over.
Updated 12.30.
THE GARDAÍ AND the Defence Forces are working to prevent any attack here and detailed preparations have been made in the event of one.
A special meeting to assess how prepared Ireland is in relation to terrorist threats heard that our threat assessment will remain under continuous review.
The meeting was held in the wake of the Manchester terrorist attack to review the state’s arrangements and level of preparedness in the event of an attack.
The Taoiseach and Tanaiste, along with a number of other ministers, were briefed on the threat assessment by security authorities.
It was noted that while a terrorist attack here is possible it is unlikely and there is no specific information in relation to any threat to Ireland from international terrorism.
Security authorities indicated that they remain in daily contact with their counterparts in the UK, the EU and beyond.
However, the meeting was also told that the assessment will remain under continuous review.
Gardaí are working closely with event organisers to ensure that appropriate safety and security measures are in place at events over the summer and regular “scenario exercises” involving a number of agencies continue to be held and the lessons learned are shared among the bodies in question.
The Taoiseach chaired the meeting of Ministers and senior officials of agencies including defence, justice, transport and health.
‘Ireland not immune’
Speaking in the Dail yesterday, the Taoiseach said, “I was very impressed with the immediate response to the tragedy of the first responders in Manchester.”
He noted that any event, whether it be a concert or major sporting event in any country, carries risks.
However, he said it is important for the government of the day to “give assurance to people that everything humanly possible is being done and put in place to protect the innocent people and citizens of our country”.
Yesterday, the gardaí warned that Ireland is “not immune” from the threat of terrorism, but said that the possibility of an attackhere remains unlikely.
Fianna Fáil’s Micheál Martin raised concerns about Ireland’s preparedness for such an attack.
“Apparently, we are the only EU state that does not have its own national security and intelligence agency. That is something which needs fairly urgent examination. I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that a national committee where different people come together every time there is a crisis is not the ideal response,” said Martin.
Kenny said when the chair of the garda root-and branch review, Kathleen O’Toole begins her work, it will look at security in policing.
“There is an issue as to whether or not we should have a security and intelligence unit as a separate structure and how it currently operates. We will reflect on that,” he said.
This is not the first time the issue ofterrorism and Ireland has been raised in the Dáil.
In April, following the terrorist attack in Sweden and the bomb attack on a bus transporting the Borussia Dortmund football team to a Champions League, Labour’s Brendan Howlin said Ireland needed to “up its game” in terms of protections against terrorist attacks.
He said it might be appropriate for a Cobra-style meeting (similar to the kind held in the UK) to be held if there is an attack.
At the time, the Taoiseach said his department does not take the lead in such situations, but said if the nature of the emergency warranted a special arrangement, the Taoiseach’s department would call such a Cobra-style meeting.

PRESIDING OVER AN Ireland that legalised same-sex marriage, legislated for the X-Case 20 years after it happened, stood up to the Vatican and said goodbye to the Troika was Enda Kenny.
Like him or loathe him (and you’ll find people in both camps in every nook and cranny of the country), it is not a list you’d associate with the reluctant Taoiseach.
The leader of what is considered to be Ireland’s most right leaning party had to deal with an array of contentious issues in his six years at the head of government – matters that divided Ireland so that a succession of government had ignored them.
And forgetting the nuances and context we can give to contemporaneous reports, figures in history – including former taoisigh – tend to be defined by just a handful of moments in their lives and careers.
In 50 years time, what will be written about Enda Kenny in the record books?
There will certainly be a mention that after 42 years in politics, he is the Dáil’s longest-serving TD. But in the grander scheme of things, it is the big-ticket items that will – rightly or wrongly in our eyes today – see history deal gently with the Mayo man.
It may be the mere fact that such a conservative leader dealt with legacy issues that were long, consistently and uniquely kicked down the road in Irish politics that will astonish readers in decades to come. (Whether he truly wanted to or not is entirely another matter).
Same-sex marriage referendum
22 May 2015 will always be remembered as a special day in Irish history. The people of this nation became the first in the world to allow for same-sex marriage by popular vote.
While the idea of equal marriage was pushed by the Labour Party, the personal journey Kenny went on which resulted in him campaigning for a Yes vote in the referendum was important.
Before he took office in 2011, it was understood Kenny was not in favour of legalising same-sex marriage. In the next couple of years, he stayed mostly quiet on the issue despite beingchased by reportersand opponents for his views on the matter.
It is believed a change of heart came after speaking with friends and family (with Labour in coalition, there was always going to be pressure on him over the topic). One source said it wasn’t until Kenny met someone he knew that was personally affected by the issues did he start to think differently.
He later told the now-Senator Jerry Buttimer, “Let’s do this” and committed to campaigning for a Yes vote.
By 23 February 2015, he was delivering an endorsement for marriage equality to a Fine Gael crowd in Castlebar.
“This is about you, it’s about your right to say two small words, made up of three simple letters – I DO. For you, in your lives together, may they become your letters of freedom,” he told those at the annual party conference during his televised address.
Kenny then made headlines with a visit to Dublin’s famous gay venue, Pantibar.
Buttimer said he asked Kenny if he would join the party’s LGBT night out, for which the Taoiseach immediately checked his schedule and said: “I’ll be there.”

With the government’s full backing and public campaigning by the Taoiseach, the referendum passed by a large majority.
Although there were a myriad of factors involved in the win – most notably the role of non-political entities and their ability to engage people of all ages – it will be Enda Kenny’s government attached to the Marriage Act 2015.
Legislation for the X-Case
Another year, another social issue, another headache.
Abortion is something members of the Fine Gael party (and most other Irish parties) are uncomfortable talking about, never mind legislating for. While the party has recently been accused of stalling through the establishment of the Citizens Assembly, there was action in Kenny’s first term as Taoiseach.
The X-Case was one of the most controversial and closely followed legal battles in the history of the State. ASupreme Courtruling was left idle for 20 years until, finally, changes to the law were introduced. While some will say outside pressures forced Kenny to take action, the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act was signed into law in 2013.
It allows for women to have a legal abortion in Ireland if there is a risk to their life, including through suicide.
It didn’t go as far as many pro-choice people wanted, but neither was it popular among pro-life groups. Fine Gael also lost a number of high-profile deputies as a result.
However, the stick of ‘not legislating for X’ was and is no longer one that Kenny can be beaten with.

Apology to the women of the Magdalene Laundries
Not many politicians have broken down in Dáil Eireann. Kenny, as Taoiseach, did so on one occasion in February 2013.
Two weeks after receiving a report into the treatment of women who lived in Magdalene Laundries, he stood up to give a personal apology to the survivors – many of whom sat in the gallery above him.
With tears in his eyes, and a quiver in his voice, he addressed them by saying, “Let me conclude by again speaking directly to the women whose experiences in Magdalene Laundries have negatively affected their subsequent lives.
“This is a national shame, for which I again say, I am deeply sorry and offer my full and heartfelt apologies.”
On the day, the women welcomed his apology with open arms, smiles and tear of their own.
Since that day, complaints have trickled through about not enough being done to fulfill the promises made after that damning report by Martin McAleese. But the moment is recorded in history as a fine one for Kenny, the man who had already taken on the Vatican.
That Vatican speech
It was two years earlier and he was fresh in the job. A conservative. A Catholic. A known supporter of the Pope. It was a completely unprecedented attack that made headlines across the world.
But after the publication of the horrific Cloyne Report, Kenny stood in the Dáil with an entirely different set of emotions.
“Never before has a Taoiseach used such language in criticising the Catholic church,” David Davin-Power reported on that day’sRTÉ News.
“In time, Enda Kenny’s speech today may be seen as marking the end once and for all of any lingering deference in relations between the body politic and the Catholic church… and the language he used to criticise the Vatican was quite simply extraordinary and represents the strongest possible rebuke to another state,” he later added.
Kenny had told the Dáil that his words did not come easy, as a practicing Catholic but that the report tells a tale of a “frankly brazen disregard for protecting children”.
“The Cloyne Report excavates the dysfunction, disconnection, elitism …. the narcissism that dominate the culture of the Vatican to this day.
“Far from listening to evidence of humiliation and betrayal with St Benedict’s ‘ear of the heart’……the Vatican’s reaction was to parse and analyse it with the gimlet eye of a canon lawyer. This calculated, withering position being the polar opposite of the radicalism, humility and compassion upon which the Roman Church was founded.
“The radicalism, humility and compassion which are the very essence of its foundation and purpose.The behaviour being a case of Roma locuta est: causa finita est. Except in this instance, nothing could be further from the truth.”
On the victims, he noted:
“The abusers continued to officiate at family weddings and funerals. In one case, the abuser even officiated at the victim’s own wedding.”
The Taoiseach said there was little he could do to comfort those that were abused by the religious orders in Ireland and in the years to follow – akin to the Magdalene women – there have been quite a number of complaints about the function of redress schemes and treatment of survivors.
While Davin-Power’s prediction hasn’t quite come to fruition – and the fact that one of Kenny’s last acts was to officially invite the Pope to Ireland – the speech will get prominent place in any retrospective on his career.
Tuam babies
He repeated the trick just this year following further revelations about the Mother & Baby Home in Tuam, Co Galway.
After the discovery of human remains were confirmed to be of babies, toddlers and young children, Kenny once more did not hold back the strong and emotive words in the Dáil.
It was yet another issue highlighting the Church’s power in Irish society, and how Kenny – despite his background – wasn’t afraid to take it on.
Navigating Ireland after the bailout
Other than social issues, many will commend Kenny for seeing Ireland through the economic crash. (Many more will fight tooth-and-nail against that opinion).
Kenny took office in the midst of the economic crisis, winning the largest majority in Irish history in the 2011 general election.
The IMF were in town, Ireland had lost its sovereignty and unemployment was pushing 15%. His election promises were based on reform and getting the economy moving again. Once Fine Gael entered government with the Labour Party, it became apparent that the downturn was not going to be easily righted.
Both parties in the coalition have said that when the true scale of the economic crisis was revealed to them, it was “sobering”.
In order to get Ireland’s house in order, rather than repeating the giveaway budgets of the past, Budget 2012 was tough. Too tough for some.
The government introduced a 2% VAT increase, disability grants were cut, child benefits were cut, there was an increase in student registration fees, motor tax, petrol, diesel, cigarettes and a raft of garda stations were closed.
Measures such as the above continued year after year. But much of that may be skipped over as footnotes. The numbers will show that on leaving office, Kenny left an Ireland with a 7% unemployment rate and being dubbed “the father of the success story of Ireland in recent years” in Europe (by the EPP’s Manfred Weber).
On the other hand (and this should be emphasised greatly), the raft of austerity measures imposed on the Irish people, as well as the refusal to burn bondholders, caused long-term damage to Irish society.
While the history books might state that one of his major achievements was leading Ireland out of the bailout and getting the country back to a decent state economically, others might recall personal hardship faced by families living in hotel rooms and homeless people on the street. They will point to how the Fine Gael rhetoric of ‘Keep the Recovery Going’ was utterly ill-timed and a serious miscalculation in the 2016 General Election.
But, as we said, the history books can tend to cover over the cracks and present an easier narrative – an era or a person with a certain shine. How Enda is portrayed in the future – only time will tell?
ENDA KENNY HAS stepped down as Taoiseach and leader of Fine Gael.
Whether or not Kenny will retire from public life at the next election is not yet known, although after 42 years in Dáil Éireann the prospect is a likely one.
It has now emerged, however, that Kenny is set to receive a retirement lump sum of €378,000, in addition to annual pension payments of €126,000.
But, given the ongoing wrangles over public sector pay, is this excessive? Or are the figures justified by Kenny’s length of service and status as an ex-leader of his country?

Update 9.45pm
MICHAEL NOONAN HAS announced that he does not want to carry on as Finance Minister when a successor to Enda Kenny is appointed.
Leah FarrellLeah Farrell
The minister also added that he will retire at the next general election. In a statement released this afternoon, Noonan said:
Noonan said that he will continue to carry out his duties as Minister for Finance until a successor is appointed but that he will not be seeking re-election to the Dáil at the next general election.
He said: “It has been a privilege to represent the people of Limerick since I was first elected in 1981 and I look forward to continuing to do so until an election is called.
“I have been honoured to serve as Minister for Finance since March 2011 and have introduced six annual budgets and one supplementary budget.
“I believe now is a good time for a new Finance Minister to take up office. Ireland is the fastest growing economy in Europe, the budget is almost balanced and we are on the cusp of full employment.”
Kenny paid tribute to Noonan this evening, saying his contribution to the restoration of the Irish economy has been “extraordinary”.
“His taxation measure proved to be fair, balanced and among the most progressive in Europe. He brought stability and confidence to Irish proposals at ECOFIN (the EU’s Economic and Financial Affairs Council). This assisted greatly with my own engagement with EU leaders at Council level.
“Above all else, Michael remains a close personal friend of mine.”
‘A formidable politician and parliamentarian’
Earlier, Minister for Housing Simon Coveney, who has thrown his hat into the Fine Gael leadership competition, said he wanted to express his thanks to Noonan his “extraordinary contribution to public life”.

“I think Michael Noonan has played probably the most significant role in rebuilding our economy from the very, very broken state that Michael Noonan found it in when he became Minister for Finance.
“I consider him a friend of mine, he’s someone I have learned a huge amount about politics and about life from and I hope to work with him in the future,” he added.
Fianna Fáil’s finance spokesperson Michael McGrath said Noonan had been a ”formidable politician and parliamentarian”.
“Of course, there have been many occasions where Minister Noonan and I disagreed on policy, but throughout every one of those disagreements, I have no doubt that he was motivated by a desire to always act in the national interest.”

DAY ONE OF the Fine Gael leadership contest began outside the party headquarters on Upper Mount Street, with the unveiling of two very slick-looking campaign posters of Simon Coveney.
One poster shows the light side of Simon – all smiles, while the second poster shows serious Simon, deep in thought.
The two posters flanked his team of supporters on the steps as he delivered his pitch on why he should be the next leader of Fine Gael and the next Taoiseach.
“Fine Gael has to be and will always be, if I’m leader, a party who represents everybody,” the Cork TD insisted.
Coveney said he wants to be the man to unite the country, and had plenty to say about his ambitions for his party at today’s event (although it’s perhaps unlikely that any political organisation could draw votes from demographics as diverse as somebody ‘who slept on the street’ and someone ‘living in a mansion’).
‘The Big Mo’
So far, momentum is with Leo Varadkar.
The parliamentary party – TDs, senators and MEPs – has 65% of the voting power in the leadership contest.
The Varadkar campaign trumpeted endorsements from a range of senators and Dáil members today – to open up a clear lead over Coveney.

However, the ‘leading man’ was entirely absent from today’s proceedings.
Instead, his campaign highlighted the volume of Oireachtas members who had come out to support him – the senators and TDs were wheeled out in not one, but two press conferences today.
Some political observers have wondered whether Coveney has the charisma to be an effective leader – and the ‘x-factor’ question was asked at his morning event today.
With a smile, he replied:
“That depends on what you describe as the x-factor… For me it’s about honest, strong, delivery.
TDs declare their support for Leo Varadkar today.Sam BoalSam Boal
It’s been said before – that while Coveney is the workhorse, Leo Varadkar is the show pony.
Coveney said today he wanted an honest, clean contest with no negative campaigning. But he did say:
‘Team Leo’, however, disputed any assertions that the Dublin TD hasn’t achieved very much in his ministerial roles.
Leo’s ‘the best man for the job’ the group of Fine Gael senators said this morning – without giving much more detail as to why, but insisting he would boost the fortunes of the party.

Talk around Leinster House, even from those not in the Fine Gael party, was focused on the contest.
The likes of Solidarity-PBP’s Richard Boyd Barrett said it shouldn’t be a distraction, but it certainly appears to be – particularly for those in government.
With their minds on other things, government members failed to turn up to vote on a Labour motion on delaying the sale of AIB shares resulting in it passing (see above).
There really was only one show in town today – the Leo and Simon show.
And while the Varadkar camp has the edge – how it will all end is anyone’s guess.

Coveney’s team said it was happy with how day one had gone down. Varadkar, meanwhile, is expected to show up in person tomorrow to lay out his grand plan.
“We have put in the groundwork weeks ago, we have this,” a ‘Leo’ person insisted earlier.
But the Coveney team were just as ebullient. ”We are going to win, there is no doubt about it,” one supporter said.
Either way, the country will have a new Fine Gael leader – and shortly afterwards, a new Taoiseach – early next month.
WITH YESTERDAY’S ANNOUNCEMENT that Enda Kenny will step down as Fine Gael leader came speculation about who will replace him.
The third favourite for the role, backable at 22/1 with bookies, was Tánaiste and Justice Minister Frances Fitzgerald.
That was until this morning, when she declared herself out of the race saying that entering the contest “is not the right decision for me”.
Her confirmationthat she had “seriously considered contesting the leadership election” tallies with what sources close to her have indicated, that there was interest in the role. However, the events of the last 24 hours have left her unable to see a path to the Taoiseach’s office.
One source said:
Career
Fitzgerald has served as a national politician since 1992, when she was elected to the Dáil in Dublin South East. She held that seat for 10 years, before losing it in 2002.
From there, she did not return to the national stage until 2007, when she ran in the Dublin Mid-West constituency – but again she missed out on a seat.
She was subsequently elected to the Seanad and immediately installed as Fine Gael’s leader in the Seanad.
She served in that role for four years, before being re-elected to the Dáil, finishing second in the Dublin Mid-West constituency as Fine Gael and Labour swept to power.
Despite her nine-year absence from the Dáil, Kenny put her straight in his cabinet, making her the first-ever Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.
She later succeeded Alan Shatter as Justice Minister in May 2014, a position she has held since. Last May, she would add Tánaiste to her title.
Many people who have worked with and opposite Fitzgerald say that she would have been more than capable of doing the job.
“I genuinely think that had she been in a position to challenge Enda in 2010, she could be Taoiseach,” says one person familiar with Fitzgerald.
“It’s not a question of ability here. She’s very capable.”
In the end for Fitzgerald, there were two obvious obstacles; the field and the gardaí.
With Coveney and Varadkar the early front-runners, the race has narrowed in the last month. Around about the same time, she was fielding what felt like daily scandals in the gardaí.
“I don’t think it’s a question of stomach for the fight at all,” says one.
Others wonder if ongoing controversies in the gardaí and the Charleton Tribunal meant that Fitzgerald was automatically behind the black ball and unable to garner the support within the party necessary to run.
“Whether she likes it or not,” says a political opponent, “The gardaí are a problem for her. She’s been Justice Minister three years and new scandals feel like they’re popping up every week.
“If she ran, we’d hit her with that every day.”
Fitzgerald has not yet indicated if she will contest the next election, nor who she intends to support for her party’s leader.
HE WAS ELECTED to Dáil Éireann following the death of his father, a long-serving TD popular in his local constituency.
Thrust onto the party political stage aged in his mid-20s, he remained on the backbenches for quite a few years before becoming one of Fine Gael’s mainstays, one of the people most recognisable from the party.
Now, two decades on, he is one vote away from becoming the leader of the country.
And no, we’re not talking about Enda Kenny about to take the reins as Taoiseach in 2011, although the parallels are uncanny.
On the cusp of the top job, Simon Coveney will be trodding on a well-worn path if he is elected the leader of Fine Gael and becomes the new Taoiseach.
Starting in politics following the death of his father in 1998, Coveney only has Leo Varadkar in the way if he is to become the next leader.
This morning, flanked by his supporters, he launched his campaign with the promise of uniting the country behind Fine Gael.

What’s more, if selected, he will become Ireland’s youngest ever Taoiseach, taking the post around nine months younger than Bertie Ahern was when he took the top job aged 45 in 1997.
In the family
Simon Coveney was born in Cork on 16 June 1972. The Coveneys were one of the well-known “Merchant Prince” families, a term used for an affluent group of Corkonians.
His father, Hugh, served as a Fine Gael TD for Cork South-Central for six years in the 1980s, and then for a further four in the 90s before his death in 1998.
Coveney attended school in Cork before enrolling at Clongowes Wood College, a boarding school in Kildare, in his teens. These days, the private school comes at a cost of €18,650 per year.
It would perhaps be surprising when considering the straight-faced politician he appears now, but Coveney was actually expelled from the school during transition year.
He toldHot Press in a 2015 interview: “When I was in fourth year, I did go through a phase of deliberately breaking the rules: I wouldn’t be alone in that.
Back on the straight and narrow, Coveney went to university and achieved a BSc in Agriculture and Land Management.

His older brother Patrick has enjoyed considerable success in the private sector, working as the CEO of food company Greencore.
It had originally been presumed that Patrick would follow in his father’s footsteps, but it was Simon, who had just embarked on a round-the-world trip on a yacht for charity, who came home to begin his political journey.
Making an impression
When Hugh Coveney died unexpectedly in 1998, the 26-year-old Simon was thrust into the spotlight at a young age, winning a subsequent by-election.
In the Dáil, veteran Fine Gael politician Maurice Manning paid this tribute to the deceased TD: “We were fortunate to have had Hugh Coveney in politics as he gave it a good name.
In political circles, similar sentiments are expressed about his son Simon today.
Deputy Lord Mayor of Cork city, Joe Kavanagh, toldTheJournal.iethat Coveney always delivers when he says he will.
“He has certainly made an impression,” he said. “He’s very passionate about his local community. If there’s a local issue to be dealt with, he’s there.”
A staunch supporter of then-leader John Bruton in his first few years, Coveney was a backbencher who managed to keep his seat as Fine Gael went into meltdown in the 2002 general election, losing 23 of its seats.

A brief stint as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) aside, Coveney steadily rose within Fine Gael ranks in the Dáil occupying the position of spokesperson on communications and transport during the 2000s.
Officially, Coveney sided with Richard Brutonin the famed heave against Enda Kenny in 2010but there were strong suspicions that he acted as a “double-agent” during the affair.
Our oral history of the event delved into the behind-the-scenes goings on at Fine Gael at the time:
He retained his place on the frontbench in a subsequent reshuffle, as did some of the other rebels such as Leo Varadkar and Charlie Flanagan.
Following Fine Gael’s strong performance in the 2011 general election, Coveney was chosen to take on the brief as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.
Central role
Coveney brought his background in agriculture, dating from his university days, to bear as Minister for Agriculture.

Kavanagh said that there was an impression among people in Cork that he had delivered on each ministerial role he held:
Away from his brief, Coveney was seen as a central figure in a number of referendums, including the same-sex marriage referendum.
Usual supporters of Fine Gael weren’t the only ones impressed with Coveney as spoke passionately on a number of occasions in favour of a yes vote.
Speaking on RTÉ’s Claire Byrne Live with a week to go before the polls, he gave a clear indication of what people were actually voting on:

Welcome clarity from@simoncoveney& Geoffrey Shannon on#cblive- utterly refutes the scaremongering from the No side@YesEquality2015
Later, he also held the position as Minister for Defence alongside the agriculture brief, before the 2016 general election.
In the wake of the uncertain results that were offered by the electorate last year, Coveney was heavily involved in negotiations with Fianna Fáil and independents before the minority government was established.
Since the formation of the government in May 2016, he has held the challenging role of Minister for Housing at a time when issues around homelessness dominate the national agenda.
It was pinpointed as a key challenge for this government to tackle, and Coveney was under no illusion about the task faced.
“I see housing as a challenge for this government, so I wanted to test myself and see if I could take it on,” he toldTheJournal.ie.
Since becoming minister, he hasoverseen ambitious plansto alleviate the housing crisis but the number of people homeless has actually increased during his tenure.
In Budget 2017, the government committed to spending €98 million to tackle homelessness, up from €70 million in 2016.
As the number of homeless people continues to increase, however, the government has a hard task to try to stem the tide.
Focus Ireland director of advocacy Mike Allen toldTheJournal.iethat the government was lacking a targeted strategy to get families out of homelessness long-term.
Simon says

Seen as a proven vote-getter rather than possessing the charismatic appeal of Leo Varadkar, Simon Coveney is to some degree a “safe choice” for Fine Gael.
An able speaker with experience in both rural and national issues, Coveney is a second-generation Fine Gael politician with strong party roots.
In the departments where he served as minister he has a reputation for openness, honesty and a meticulous approach, and this has proven popular with the grassroots in Fine Gael.
Of course, becoming Fine Gael party leader after Enda is no guarantee of becoming Taoiseach but appears a fairly likely scenario at this stage.
To be Taoiseach, Coveney has to first win over his colleagues in Fine Gael before convincing the independents and Fianna Fáil to continue offering their support for this minority government.
Leo Varadkar is the bookies’ favourite – at the time of writing he is 1/5 to win, with Coveney 3/1 – to become the next leader of the country, but Simon Coveney cannot be ruled out.
Last September, it was put to him that most people expected the minority government to fall within six months.
Coveney disagreed. He toldTheJournal.ie: “I don’t think that is realistic. I think we might surprise a few people.”
Following his father into politics, the even-handed Coveney has done little to shock as he has risen steadily within the Fine Gael party and performed solidly in government.
It may be a surprise that this government remains intact, but it would be little surprise to see Simon Coveney chosen to become Ireland’s next Taoiseach within the next few weeks.
YESTERDAY, ENDA KENNY made the long-awaited announcement that he was stepping down as leader of Fine Gael, and will step down as Taoiseach once a new leader is elected in time for the June bank holiday.
The main contenders are Simon Coveney and Leo Varadkar, who’ll have to win over the independents and Fianna Fáil to ensure that there’s still a Fine Gael Taoiseach in place in time for the summer recess.
So, at the first Leaders’ Questions since Enda’s announcement, it was Sinn Féin who stuck the knife in, with Mary Lou McDonald saying that Kenny became Taoiseach at a time of crisis, and leaves the country in the midst of one.
Here’s how it played out.

Updated 12.10pm
MINISTER FOR EDUCATION Richard Bruton has decided he won’t be contesting the Fine Gael leadership, and will be supporting Leo Varadkar as leader.
His announcement comes as Enda Kenny stepped down from the position last night, kickstarting a campaign to determine who will be his successor.
He said that he decided there was no need for him to run, as the two announced candidates – housing minister Simon Coveney, and social protection minister Leo Varadkar – provided enough of a choice for the party.
Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney are the two frontrunners in the campaign early on, and the only two to be definitely contesting the position so far.
Bruton said that he made his decision not to run in the past few hours.
He added that he notified Simon Coveney of his intention to back Varadkar, but wasn’t able to get through to Varadkar to let him know – so his public announcement would be the first he’ll hear of it.
He joins Paschal Donohoe, Simon Harris, and Frances Fitzgerald in the ministers who have said they won’t contest the Fine Gael leadership.
Earlier
There has been much speculation over whether some of their party colleagues will throw their hat in the ring for the leadership.
Fitzgerald was seen as a strong possibility to announce her candidacy, however the Justice Minister has now put an end to speculation by saying she will not enter.
Justice minister Frances Fitzgerald announced this morning that she would run for Fine Gael leader, saying that entering the contest “is not the right decision for me”.
In a short statement released this morning, Fitzgerald said she had “seriously considered contesting the leadership election”.
“I have been touched by the encouragement and support I have received,” she said.
She credited Enda Kenny for his “immense and extraordinary” work on behalf of the country.
“He strove for the best in a way that was tireless, relentless, enthusiastic and compassionate,” she said.
Fitzgerald said she looked forward to the campaign and the “bright future ahead for Fine Gael”.
Only Fine Gael members can vote for the next party leader. The vote will be split between TDs, councillors and general party members.
A vote will be cast by councillors and parliamentary party members on Friday 2 June. A Dáil vote to elect a Taoiseach is then expected to take place on Tuesday 13 June.
With reporting from Gráinne Ní Aodha
WAS ENDA KENNY a good Taoiseach?
It seems the nation is split on the answer.
A poll carried out by Amarách Research for Claire Byrne Live andTheJournal.iefound that41%of Irish people thought Enda Kenny was a good Taoiseach, while42%of people thought he failed as Taoiseach.
From the panel of over 1,000 Irish adults, 17% of respondents could not decide.
The longest-standing Fine Gael Taoiseach the country has ever had, Kenny announced yesterday that he is to step down from his role. Kenny has led the party for over 15 years.
Kenny told the Fine Gael parliamentary party about his decision at a meeting at 4.40pm on Wednesday.
Over the past few months, Kenny repeatedly delayed the announcement of his departure plans and there was speculation throughout the week that he would again decide to hold the position even longer.
However, in a statement issued to the media at the beginning of the party meeting, Kenny got the job done in just seven minutes.
The statement was released via his Twitter, reading: “Last year I indicated that I would not lead the FG Party into the next General Election. I have decided to implement that decision today.”
Effective from midnight just gone, Enda Kenny retired as leader of Fine Gael.
His statement confirmed that he will continue to carry out his duties as party leader until his successor is elected through the Fine Gael leadership election process.
“I would like to stress the huge honour and privilege that it has been for me to lead our party for the past 15 years, in opposition and into Government on two successive occasions,” Kenny said.
“I thank all our members, past and present for that privilege.”
Kenny received a standing ovation from TDs and senators as he walked out of the room.
As he made his exit, Kenny declared: “Let the games begin.”
What now?
Each party follows its own rules for selecting its leader. For Fine Gael, candidates must be members of Dáil Éireann and must be nominated in writing by members representing at least 10% of the parliamentary party.
Candidates have the next seven days to achieve this to be accepted into the race.
The party’s Executive Council is set to meet today to decide on the ground rules for a contest which will begin immediately.
Frontrunners of the leadership contest, Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney have so far refrained from canvassing for support, to allow Kenny his moment.
The position of leader of the party will be determined by electoral vote, made up of parliamentary party members (TDs, senators, and MEPs), members of the party (people who are registered as Fine Gael members) and councillors.
Current rules state that the polling day and times are determined by the National Executive but cannot be later than 20 days after a vacancy of the position of leadership arises. This is due to be held on Friday 2 June.

IT WAS ALL done and dusted in just seven minutes, in the end.
His colleagues – Dublin TD Catherine Byrne among them – did their best to try and persuade the Taoiseach to hang on at their parliamentary party meeting for a little longer.
But Kenny wanted to avoid the plamásing, and asked if it was okay for him to go.
After more than 40 years as a TD, more than six as Taoiseach and after a long goodbye that many political observers imagined would already be over by now, Kenny had said all he needed to say in a statement issued to the media just as his party meeting was due to begin.
He received a standing ovation from TDs and senators as he walked out of the room at Leinster House – but wished his potential successors well for the campaign ahead as he left, declaring “Let the games begin”.
Kenny had put off making any detailed announcement about his departure plans before – and there was speculation around Leinster House that he might once again attempt to hang on a little longer.
But instead, it was all dealt with quickly and relatively painlessly – and it was left to his colleagues to rush to the Plinth to sing his praises and send out gushing press releases.

A busy afternoon
Will he? … Won’t he?
The muttered questions could be heard throughout the room at an event to launch a report on bereavement yesterday afternoon.
The venue, at Government Buildings, was unusually packed.
Senior Fine Gael figures like Foreign Minister Charlie Flanagan, Junior Minister Damien English and the party’s Chief Whip Regina Doherty, as well as a raft of senators and other TDs, squashed into the Italian Room – sparking speculation that Kenny might make an earlier-than-expected announcement.
Senator Marie Louise O’Donnell, a close friend of the Taoiseach (he has nominated her to the upper house on two occasions) was moved to tears as she thanked him for giving her such opportunities in politics.

They hugged as the launch came to a close, there was applause, and Kenny departed to make his way down the long corridor to greet his fellow party members.
No-one was quite sure how the Taoiseach would make his announcement – but it was thought he wouldn’t want his big news simply leaked out by a random backbencher.
In the end, Twitter was the medium of choice.
“Last year I indicated that I would not lead the Fine Gael Party into the next General Election. I have decided to implement that decision today,” his statement read.
As the short meeting ended, TDs and senators flooded out to the Leinster House Plinth to speak to the media and to pay tribute to the man that had lead the party for close to two decades.
There were only kind words for Enda Kenny – even from some who have criticised him in the past.
“It’s an end of an era,” Dublin TD Noel Rock said.
“A man who had his finger on the pulse and always put the party ahead of himself and put the country ahead of the party,” said James Reilly, the senator and former Health Minister.
“We can be very proud of him,” Fergus O’Dowd reckoned. Party’s chairman Martin Heydon said he had displayed “a leadership style that has been compassionate, pragmatic and inclusive”.

Reporters huddled around supporters of Kenny – some of whom insisted many people had wanted the Taoiseach to stay on a bit longer.
There were even nice words from the opposition.
One notable tribute came from Labour’s Joan Burton, who observed that the Fine Gael leader had often worked 14-15 hours per day – adding that this came easy to him largely because he was very physically fit.
Even Sinn Féin’s Gerry Adams was more restrained than usual, telling reporters that the Taoiseach had done “his best” (but stressing that he didn’t think that was good enough).
The likely contestants to succeed him kept their powder dry – there were no major announcements, just the sort of press-released statements you’d expect.
Don’t expect that state of affairs to last very long though.

TAOISEACH ENDA KENNY has announced his plans to step down from the leadership of Fine Gael.
Our political reporter Christina Finn (@christinafinn8) was at Leinster House for today’s parliamentary party meeting and Daragh Brophy (@DaraghBroph) was liveblogging atTheJournal.ieHQ.

While we’re waiting for an announcement from Enda – either now or later – it’s worth pointing out that he’s heading off to Chicago from 4-6 June and also has a trip scheduled to Belgium on June 7.
He also said today in the Dáil that he has another trip planned – to the north inner city.
He said he will go there in the coming weeks with Paschal Donohoe – a local Fine Gael TD – to check in on progress on initiatives launched for the area in the wake of a string of shootings in the past year.

TAOISEACH ENDA KENNY today announced he would step down as leader of Fine Gael at midnight.
He will stay on as Taoiseach until a new party leader is elected, a contest expected to conclude on Friday, 2 June.
Politicians from across the spectrum have beenpaying tribute to Kenny, who has been a TD since 1975 and is the longest-serving Fine Gael Taoiseach.
Some international leaders have also released statements about Kenny’s departure.
British Prime Minister Theresa May wished Kenny “all the very best”, saying he “has been a strong and consistent friend to the UK”.

ENDA KENNY’S TENURE as Fine Gael leader and Taoiseach is drawing toan end this evening.
He has finally outlined a timeline for his departure, telling his party colleagues he will step down at midnight.
Kenny will stay on as Taoiseach during the leadership contest, which begins tomorrow.
The contest is expected to conclude by Friday 2 June – just before the bank holiday weekend – when the party will announce a new leader.
Niall CarsonNiall Carson
Keen not to be seen to be ‘pushed out’ of the top job in Irish politics, for some time now theTaoiseach has been refusing to say when exactly he would step aside.
He told voters he would not seek a third term as Taoiseach in advance of last February’s general election. And, since last summer,some party members have been vocalin stating they want a clear indication when he would be stepping down.
The Taoiseach, who is also the longest-serving TD in the Dáil, faced down the threat of a motion of no confidence and chose to ignore calls from some of younger members of the party who took to the airwaves to say his position was untenable.
However, in the background of all this, Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney, the apparent front-runners to take his job, have been in election-mode for some time now.
Well, basically we will have another Taoiseach leading the country fairly soon.
Every party has its own way of selecting its leaders – Sinn Féingot some heat overthe lack of transparency around the appointment of Michelle O’Neill in the North, whileLabour’s Alan Kellytook issue with not being able to contest for the leadership within his own party.
Each party follows its own rules. There hasn’t been a leadership contest in Fine Gael for quite a long time, so let’s dust off the rule book.
Candidates must be members of Dáil Éireann and must be nominated in writing by members representing at least 10% of the parliamentary party.
This all has to be done within seven days of the vacancy arising.
Meanwhile, the Executive Council of the party (the group that takes core organisational decisions for the party and is elected at the party’s Ard Fheis) will begin to organise the election.
The group of around 30 people, which includes some TDs and registered party members, make arrangements for the campaign.
The position of leader of the Fine Gael parliamentary party is determined by the electoral college system.
It’s made up of the parliamentary party members (TDs, senators, and MEPs), members of the party (people who are registered as Fine Gael members) and councillors.
Each group has a different voting weight, which is as follows:
No member shall be entitled to vote more than once (as you might imagine).
Niall Carson / PA WireNiall Carson / PA Wire / PA Wire
How do they vote, are there polling booths?
Each member eligible to vote will be issued with a ballot paper in a manner approved by the Executive Council. Members cast their vote at polling centres on the date fixed by the council.
When is polling day?
According to the rules, polling day and times of polling are determined by the National Executive but shall not be later than 20 days after a vacancy in the position of leader arises.
However in exceptional circumstances, the Executive Council, in consultation with the chairperson of the parliamentary party, may extend this time.
Councillors vote on the same day and at the same venues as the party membership, while parliamentary party members cast their votes at a special parliamentary party meeting convened by the chairperson (due to be held Friday 2 June).
Then what?
Traditionally speaking, once there is a new party leader, the sitting Taoiseach would vacate his office in an orderly fashion, at which point the Dáil would then have to elect a Taoiseach by voting in the chamber.
The Dáil is in recess the week after the June Bank holiday, so it’s expected a vote for Taoiseach will be held on their first day back, Tuesday 13 June.So, there you have it.
Watch this space.

AFTER MONTHS OF speculation, Enda Kenny has announced thathe will step down as leader of Fine Gaelat midnight tonight.
He’s to stay on as Taoiseach until a new leader is elected, but we want to take the time to reflect on his years in office, and how we will remember them.

ENDA KENNY HAS been a TD since 1975, leader of Fine Gael since 2002 and the Taoiseach of the country since 2011.
Many say his political career has now been stretched to the max, and it’s time to cede at least the two latter jobs.
Over the past few months, the Mayo deputy has repeatedly said he will let his future plans be known – but hasn’t quite got around to it yet.
Will today be the day? Those in the know say he will tell the Fine Gael parliamentary party tonight what his departure date will be, kicking off a leadership contest. But does the Taoiseach have something else up his sleeve?TheJournal.iewill keep you updated throughout the day.
“LOOKING FORWARD to tomorrow, Taoiseach?” the scrum of media asked Enda Kenny outside Merrion Square this evening.
Giving nothing away, the outgoing Fine Gael leader replied: “I look forward to every day.”
The sun was setting over the park (and perhaps on Kenny’s career as the Dáil’s longest-serving TD) as he made his way across the road, avoiding his car and driver, to set about a walk through the beautiful grounds.
Basking in the evening light, the Taoiseach stopped to talk to passersby – perhaps his final lap of glory?
Last week, Kenny said he would address the issue of the Fine Gael leadership at the parliamentary party meeting tomorrow.
While speculation is rife in Leinster House, it’s widely expected that Kenny will set out his plans to step down as Taoiseach tomorrow.
However, others think he might surprise everyone by stating that he wants to stay on until the summer. Who knows?
Sam BoalSam Boal
Keeping his cards close to his chest this evening, the Taoiseach was asked by the hungry media to comment on tomorrow’s announcement. Enda Kenny replied: “Now, now.”
Addressing a crowd full of politicos at the launch of the Nealon’s Guide to the 32nd Dáil and 25th Seanad (a guidebook of sorts of who’s who in government) the Taoiseach was reflective on his time as leader.
Perhaps a warning to who might take his place (widely tipped to be Leo Varadkar or Simon Coveney) Kenny said your life is never really your own once you become Taoiseach.
“From my experience of this job it takes up practically every waking hour of your day and I also learned that people actually own you in a very different way than you ever imagined.”
Sam BoalSam Boal
Politics has changed a lot since he was first elected in 1975. The simple times are gone, he mused, stating there was no Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp, or Viber to get your message across back then.
Politics in today’s world has been reduced to soundbites and entertainment for some, said Kenny.
The Mayo TD also had some tips to those politicians out there that have all the slick messaging, but no substance.
The speech had self-serving elements, with Kenny reminding people that Ireland is the fastest growing country in Europe for a fourth year in a row, and boasting that when he is in Europe he is often asked how this small country achieved so much is so little time.
“These things don’t happen by accident as much as some people might imagine that they do,” he said.
But he had kind words to say about his former junior partners in Government – the Labour Party – who effectively took many of the bullets for Fine Gael. With some of its members in the crowd this evening, Kenny thanked his former Tánaiste.

Kenny also addressed the form of the current government, highlighting that many said it wouldn’t last.

If ever the Taoiseach needed a reminder of just how much ‘new politics’ had changed matters, he said he got his reminder when he was leafing through the Nealon’s Guide.
Opening up the guide on page 68 – there was Shane Ross with a caption describing him as a government minister, laughed Kenny.
How times have changed since the first Nealon’s Guide in 1977. What will the next one bring?
TAOISEACH ENDA KENNY was back in the hotseat today for question time.
The Fine Gael leader is expected to address the issue of his leadership at a party meeting tomorrow night.
Today, though, there were issues like housing and jobs at Bord Na Mona to discuss…
May 16th 20172:09PMMicheál Martin is up and he wants to talk about Bord Na Mona and it’s announcement to close one of its sites.He says workers have been treated “shabbily” over the last few weeks and says the State is turning its back on employees. Martin says Alan Kelly made a significant announcement of funding when he was minister that made workers think the factory was safe for at least ten years.He says the closure ofBord na Mona and the job losseswould make anyone cynical towards politicians and the promises they make.May 16th 20172:11PMEnda Kenny says it is a commercial enterprise, but says workers should be treated with respect. He says Bord Na Mona are moving away from the supply of peat briquettes.Martin says commitments were made of a €25 million investment in the plant – and that has not come about.Kenny says he can’t speak for the announcements made by Kelly when he was in government, saying it was perhaps “over enthusiasm” and obviously is not something that has come true.“They thought their jobs were secure… Bord Na Mona is a government agency,” Martin points out.May 16th 20172:18PMKenny says that peat briquette sales have fallen and a decision had to be made.Kenny suggests Alan Kelly’s promise of further Bord na Mona jobs was in “a moment of exuberance”.He says the company is in talks with the workers. The employees want to see the closure date pushed out, essentially.Adams is up.There is a little laughter in the chamber now as Gerry Adams mentions Kenny’s long goodbye. Even Enda sees the funny side of things, pointing to Adams with a smile and wink.Adams raises the issue of border checks and highlights the Barnier visit last week.May 16th 20172:22PMHe says no one knows the outcome of the negotiations – but says there needs to be some arrangement even if there is no tariffs.He says there will not be a return to custom posts “as we knew them” along the border.Kenny says creative and imaginative solutions are needed.Adams raises Leo Varadkar’s thoughts on avoiding a trade border with the North and says he supports them, but he wants to know Simon Coveney’s position  on it.May 16th 20172:25PMAdams is now reading out quotes from Leo Varadkar who says there should be no land border and asks Enda Kenny to say that too.Even if there were no tariffs you still have two different jurisdictions, explains Kenny.Adams says there were be deep divisions if the North becomes the border between the EU and the UK.May 16th 20172:29PMJoan Collins TD is asking the Taoiseach about housing. She says that despite assurances, Minister Coveney is not going to meet his target of getting families out of hotels and B&Bs.Perhaps he thought he would be out of the job, she says, pointing to the ongoing leadership contest going on in the background in the Fine Gael party.She says it is time “to end this madness” and begin construction on social housing.“You seem to think you can conjure up housing like that,” says the Taoiseach.Collins tells the Taoiseach not to come at her with the department’s housing figures.“They are not real,” she says, highlighting the recent controversy over whether the Housing Department’s calculations of new ESB connections is the correct way to count house builds.May 16th 20172:32PMHe is now reading out a list on housing estates where he says families are living and where construction is taking place.He asks Collins are these people not real?Kenny says there will be a “very substantial” drop in families in emergency accommodation by the end of June.Collins says she is talking about local authority homes and says his figures are not real.May 16th 20172:35PMPlease come forward with proper proposals to get families out of homelessness.Kenny says there are over 1,700 hectares with potential to build. He says local authorities are now tasked with get out on with the business.He said years ago local authorities used to build social housing but they “got out of that business”.

He says the company is in talks with the workers. The employees want to see the closure date pushed out, essentially.
Adams is up.
There is a little laughter in the chamber now as Gerry Adams mentions Kenny’s long goodbye. Even Enda sees the funny side of things, pointing to Adams with a smile and wink.
Adams raises the issue of border checks and highlights the Barnier visit last week.
He says no one knows the outcome of the negotiations – but says there needs to be some arrangement even if there is no tariffs.
He says there will not be a return to custom posts “as we knew them” along the border.
Kenny says creative and imaginative solutions are needed.
Adams raises Leo Varadkar’s thoughts on avoiding a trade border with the North and says he supports them, but he wants to know Simon Coveney’s position  on it.
Adams is now reading out quotes from Leo Varadkar who says there should be no land border and asks Enda Kenny to say that too.
Even if there were no tariffs you still have two different jurisdictions, explains Kenny.
Adams says there were be deep divisions if the North becomes the border between the EU and the UK.
Joan Collins TD is asking the Taoiseach about housing. She says that despite assurances, Minister Coveney is not going to meet his target of getting families out of hotels and B&Bs.
Perhaps he thought he would be out of the job, she says, pointing to the ongoing leadership contest going on in the background in the Fine Gael party.
She says it is time “to end this madness” and begin construction on social housing.
“You seem to think you can conjure up housing like that,” says the Taoiseach.
Collins tells the Taoiseach not to come at her with the department’s housing figures.
“They are not real,” she says, highlighting the recent controversy over whether the Housing Department’s calculations of new ESB connections is the correct way to count house builds.
He is now reading out a list on housing estates where he says families are living and where construction is taking place.
He asks Collins are these people not real?
Kenny says there will be a “very substantial” drop in families in emergency accommodation by the end of June.
Collins says she is talking about local authority homes and says his figures are not real.

Please come forward with proper proposals to get families out of homelessness.
Kenny says there are over 1,700 hectares with potential to build. He says local authorities are now tasked with get out on with the business.
He said years ago local authorities used to build social housing but they “got out of that business”. The Taoiseach is not listing off what he says are contained in the department’s Rebuilding Ireland housing plan.
Roisin Shortall is now raising garda issues at Templemore and the Sunday Independent’s article about garda phone tapping of an activist working for a politician.
She also raises the tragic case of Dara Quigley.
It is absolutely staggering.
Citing the case of the departure of former Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan, she says it “looks very much like history is about to repeat itself”.
No one here is looking for a head on a plate for the sake of it.
Enda Kenny says the case of Dara Quigley is being investigated as a matter of urgency.
The Taoiseach says he has read the newspaper reports on garda bugging.
He says he has read the latest report on the State’s compliance on the Act that regulates the surveillance of communications.
Justice Paul McDermott’s report (dated 27 October)  says he attended the Justice Department and Garda HQ and said he was satisfied that all documents relating to the governance of the Act were made available and all relevant questions were answered.
He said having seen all those documents, McDermott said he was satisfied that the relevant State authorities are compliant as of the date of the report.
Kenny says these allegations about garda tapping “go back quite a number of years… I don’t have a date”.
He says at that time there were a number of changes of different ministers.
“This is a very serious matter,” he adds, but says the Justice Minister can’t order any surveillance unless it is overseen by High Court judge.
“I would like to know facts,” said Kenny.
But he adds work is being done to overhaul the gardaí.
He says this very morning he approved a long list of people to sit on root and branch review on the gardaí.
Aengus Ó Snodaigh says he wants the Minister for Justice to come before the House to give more detail on the alleged phone bugging that took place on an activist who worked for constituency rival of a politician.
The Ceann Comhairle says he thought that it was being raised during Leaders’s Questions and that would be satisfactory to members.
Solidarity-PBP’s Richard Boyd Barrett highlights that Coveney has said he is looking at setting up an agency to deal with corruption.
Enda Kenny tells Boyd Barrett says it is not correct to suggest that “this carry on is at the current time” pointing out that the bugging allegedly took place in the early 2000s.
Gerry Adams is not speaking about it.
“The Taoiseach knows exactly what happened, so why can’t we be told,” says the Sinn Féin leader.
“I don’t have the details of what happened back then,” says Kenny.
He says he was reading back the latest report.
“I do not have the report from the early 2000s,” he clarifies.
That’s it for Leaders’ Questions today folks. Tomorrow Enda Kenny is expected to address the issue of the Fine Gael leadership.
Will he stay or will he go? That is the question many people are asking.
We’ll bring up all the latest so stay tuned.

For an amendment to be made to the Irish constitution, a referendum must be held.
In the Programme for Government, the Fine Gael-led minority government pledged to hold a number of referendums during its term on a variety of topics.
To date, however, we have no date set for any referendum.
So, with the government just after celebrating its first year,TheJournal.iehad a look at the progress (or lack thereof) being made on the promised referendums.
The Eighth Amendment
The issue that presented itself most often for debate in the last few years is the Eighth Amendment of the constitution, guaranteeing the right to life of the unborn.
Despite its dominance in public discourse, the Programme for Government mentions the Eighth Amendment only once:
As we have seen, the Citizens’ Assembly considered the issue of the Eighth Amendment at length and decided that legislating for abortion is something that the Oireachtas must do.
Citizens' Assembly chairperson Mary Laffoy at the recent vote on Eighth Amendment recommendations.Sam Boal / Rollingnews.ieSam Boal / Rollingnews.ie / Rollingnews.ie
In other words, the government set up the Citizens’ Assembly to provide it with recommendations on what should be done and, while the assemblydid indeed make a number of recommendations, those suggestions will require the government to act on them.
However, if we were to take the government on its pledges in the Programme, it never explicitly said it would hold a referendum on the Eighth.
Recent statements from acrossFine GaelandFianna Fáilshow that there’s little willingness from these parties to provide their own views on the matter, and a lack of political will to tackle the issue head-on is a criticism made by both pro-life and pro-choice groups.
In perhaps the best indication to date, Tánaiste and Minister for Justice Frances Fitzgerald has said that said a referendum on the Eighth Amendment on the Constitutionshould be held next year.
Blasphemy
In the Programme for Government, pledges were made to hold referendums on Article 41.2.1 on a woman’s life in the home and Article 40.6.1 on blasphemy, among others.
Gavan Reilly / TwitterGavan Reilly / Twitter/ Twitter
In case you’d forgotten, the Defamation Act 2009 prohibits the utterance or publication of “blasphemous matter”. As for what constitutes blasphemy, the legislation defines a person as saying or publicising “blasphemous matter” if:
This topic hit the news again just this week, after it emerged that a complaint had been made to An Garda Síochanaabout comments made by TV presenter and writer Stephen Fry on an RTÉ show.
During the show, Fry told host Gay Byrne that he believed God is “quite clearly a maniac, an utter maniac, totally selfish”.
Speaking on the matter, Health Minister Simon Harris called Ireland’s blasphemy law “silly” andsaid he’d like a referendum on the issue in the near future.
So when is a referendum likely to happen?
We asked the Department of Justice, who had this response:
So, we can glean from this statement that no date has been set and is unlikely to be anytime soon, given the “further consultations” required and the necessary referendum bill to be drafted.
And what about the referendum on “women’s place in the home”?
Article 41.2 of the constitution states:
As this documentpoints out, reports as far back as 1993 have recommended that this provision of the constitution be deleted or amended.
The UN Human Rights Committee concluded that the law “perpetuates traditional attitudes toward the restricted role of women in public life, in society and in the family”.
It likely that we’ll be getting a vote on this? There is a bit more surety here, but no hint of a timeframe from the government.
The Department of Justice toldTheJournal.ie: “There is a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government that a referendum will be held on this provision.
Other promised referendums, on topics such as a Universal Patent Court and constitutional standing for the Ceann Comhairle are also yet to make significant progress.
We will almostcertainly have a referendumon whether the Irish abroad can vote in presidential elections, following an announcement from the Taoiseach, but, again, no date has yet been set.

IT’S NOW A year since this government was formed.
After 10 weeks of negotiations, Fine Gael reached a deal with Fianna Fáil that would see the former leading a minority government along with the support of independents.
A lot of this deal-making made its way into the Programme for Government, a wide-ranging document detailing what the government aims to achieve over its term in office.
The 155-page thesis contains a massive number of commitments, pledges and promises that the government said it would pursue over the next five years.
So how has it gone so far?
One year in, has the government made a telling contribution to the “fair society” that would allow communities to thrive “throughout both urban and rural Ireland” as promised?
Last week, we looked at the government’s record onhealth and housing. Now, we examine how they’ve fared in two more important pillars – jobs and education.
As part of the Programme for Government, delivering full employment back to the Irish economy was described as the “ultimate goal of the new government”.
In practice, this would “mean an extra 200,000 jobs by 2020, of which 135,000 will be outside of Dublin”.
Another key priority was the reduction of the unemployment rate to 6%. The government also aimed at facilitating the return of at least 70,000 emigrants and an aim for the unemployment rate in each county to be within one percent of the State average by 2020.
In response to a request fromTheJournal.ie, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation said that an additional 66,100 jobs were created for the whole of 2016 which it said was ahead of the target of 50,000 outlined in the government’s Action Plan for Jobs.
By then end of 2016, over two million people in Ireland were working.
The department, however, was unable to provide a figure for how many jobs had been created since the government took office, but said the CSO’s Quarterly National Household Figures, due for release soon, would provide a good indication of this.
The most recent figures show an unemployment rate of 6.2%, with 47,300 fewer people on the Live Register in April 2017 than in April 2016.
CSOCSO
The government is nearing its target in this regard but, with 66,100 jobs created last year, momentum in job creation will need to be maintained to reach the target of 200,000 new jobs.
Criticism
Rollingnews.ieRollingnews.ie
These figures have not kept Minister for Jobs, Mary Mitchell O’Connor free from criticism, however.
In October, the Irish Times published an article which quoted a number of anonymous sources discussing their concerns about the Fine Gael TD’s aptitude for the jobs portfolio.
Since then, two of her advisershave quit their roles.
Much of the criticism against Mitchell O’Connor came in the wake of the budget, before which she had floated the idea of a special tax break for returning emigrants. This was dismissed in the Dáil chamber by Enda Kenny as “unfair and discriminatory”.
She has defendedher record on occasion, ashas the Taoiseach.
She toldFora.iein March that the falling unemployment rate was evidence that she was performing well:
Kenny, meanwhile, said that he appointed Mitchell O’Connor “because of her experience” and added that she is “working well”.
On its progress on other commitments made in the Programme for Government, the department said that it “is prioritising and working through the commitments for which it has responsibility”.
It added that “IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs (Local Enterprise Offices) all had strong performances in the last 12 months”.
Although not wholly within her remit, she has repeatedly faced questions from rural TDs about job creation in these areas.
In response, Mitchell O’Connor points to CSO figures she says show that 70% of the jobs created over the past year were outside of Dublin.
Appearing before an Oireachtas Committee in March, she said that extra funding to the tune of €200 million was being provided to the IDA to “ensure it can address regional development needs”. The Minister added:
Whether or not every part of the country shares in this promised job growth is something that Mitchell O’Connor has sought to reassure on.
Leon Farrell / RollingNews.ieLeon Farrell / RollingNews.ie / RollingNews.ie
She told that Fianna Fáil’s Niall Collins during that same hearing: “We have a regional action plan for jobs. Irrespective of whether likes it or irrespective of whether he has read it, it is working.
With Brexit looming on the horizon, the government will have more opportunities to seek new business to Ireland.
Jobs are certainly coming to Ireland, but the question remains on whether every part of it will benefit equally.
Sam Boal / Rollingnews.ieSam Boal / Rollingnews.ie / Rollingnews.ie
So, what did the government promise it would do in terms of education? Here’s what the Programme for Government said:
That’s quite the mouthful. And that’s only some of the commitments made regarding education in the Programme for Government.
Further pledges related to reducing primary school class sizes, reintroduce guidance counselling to secondary schools and increasing funding for post-graduate students with a particular focus on those from low-income households.
In response to a request fromTheJournal.ie, the Department of Education returned a quite lengthy summary of its progress to date. Here’s what they said:
The department also pointed to numerous other measures, such as the provision of 1,000 extra special needs assistants, plans to deliver 400 multi-denominational and nondenominational schools by 2020 and plans to extensively recruit more teachers as examples of positive action it has taken.
Trouble ahead?
Cabinet colleagues may be envious of Richard Bruton’s comparatively crisis-free year since becoming Minister of Education.
The Tánaiste has faced garda controversies, the Minister for Health has been under pressure over the National Maternity Hospital in particular and, as pointed out above, the Minister for Jobs has faced criticism from within her own party.
Leah Farrell / Rollingnews.ieLeah Farrell / Rollingnews.ie / Rollingnews.ie
It hasn’t all been plain sailing, however, with teacher strikes seeing schools close across the country on a number of occasions, with the threat of future industrial action not yet off the table.
Late last year, secondary schools across the country closed as the ASTI union failed to reach an agreement with government after payments made to teachers for supervisory or supervision dutieswas ended.
Industrial actionwas suspended in Novemberafternew proposals were made to the ASTIby the government.
Thedeal that was offered was published on the ASTI websiteand showed that there had been a slight compromise on the supervision and substitution dispute – which says that teachers who have been working for over 15 years can opt out of that duty.
However, teachers rejected this “final deal” offerfrom the government in February.
Furthermore, teachers are threatening further strike action in the future over the lack of pay parity between newer teachers and others who’ve been in the profession for years.
The ASTI’s President Ed Byrne says teachers are “standing up for their most vulnerable colleagues”.
“Our members are standing firm and telling us to continue to hold the line on Junior Cycle reform and to vigorously pursue equal pay for equal work for our young teachers,” Byrne said.
Sam Boal / Rollingnews.ieSam Boal / Rollingnews.ie / Rollingnews.ie
With the threat of further action a very real possibility, Bruton’s aims to modernise the Irish education system may take a back seat for industrial unrest.
One feature of their progress to date is that a lot of measures have beenannouncedrather than implemented. Here are a few examples:
Fianna Fáil has been quick off the mark in its criticism of Bruton’s tenure with the education brief.
Its education spokesperson Thomas Byrne said: “Complete inertia has been the defining feature of Minister Bruton’s first year in office.
Byrne also said that hopes for “progressive change to the education system” had been dashed during Bruton’s first year as Minister for Education.
In theAction Plan for Education, Minister Bruton said in his foreword: “Too often in previous governments, ambitious plans like this were published but then little achieved.
For the Irish education system to truly become the best in Europe within a decade, these plans will need to become a reality over the lifetime of this government.
FRESH FLOWERS WERE placed at either side of the stairway which leads to the Dáil chamber, the curtains were dusted down and everyone was looking their best at Leinster House today for the visit of Europe’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier.
After a quick photo in front of a host of European flags in the lobby (placed there to mark Europe Day earlier this week) the Frenchman was lead in to the chamber, which was packed to the rafters with foreign diplomats and foreign media reps from the Washington Post, Die Welt and Le Monde.
There was certainly a buzz in the air. It is not often someone gets to address a joint sitting of the Dáil and the Seanad (others in the past include Mary MacAleese, Nelson Mandela and Tony Blair – who Enda Kenny is meeting tomorrow, as it happens).

The Financial Timesreported that Barnier would be treated to “the trappings of a visiting head of state” during his visit.
And, reflecting on the day, that can’t be denied. (However, it is worth noting that Barnier was not permitted to stand at the top of the room, but addressed politicians from the opposite end of the chamber).
Meanwhile, theUK’s Business Insidersaid Ireland is wooing Barnier, hoping that special treatment for the Frenchman will help secure a good deal for the country in Brexit negotiations.
Its headline points out the people that have preceded him in addressing senators and TDs:

Under the headline, ‘Michel Barnier’s Irish Pledge’,Politico.eusaid the chief negotiator had “struck a reassuring, even paternalistic tone” during his address to Irish lawmakers today.
But theFinancial Timesreported on what it thought was really at play here:
And the importance of Brexit was not lost on Barnier today.
Speaking in the Dáil today, he was keen to flatter the Irish, by quoting Seamus Heaney, and said Ireland’s interest will be Europe’s interest too.
However, he then got down to business and warned that Brexit would come at a cost.
He said he would work to avoid a hard border, but said customs controls – something the government have campaigned to avoid – are part of EU border management

Whether Ireland is trying to woo the man who will (hopefully) be fighting Ireland’s corner in the Brexit negotiations, there were two notable contributions in the chamber today.
Fianna Fáil’s Micheál Martin, who took a few digs at Britain’s Brexit vote, and Solidarity-PBP’s Richard Boyd Barrett, who said he found it difficult to trust Europe.
Martin said there was no strategy for implementing Brexit.
“There was just a strategy for winning the vote through a combination of bluster and aggression.
“It was not a positive assertion of sovereignty; it was the culmination of 30 years of an increasingly corrosive scapegoating of Europe and immigrants for the home-grown divisions in British society,” he said.
Richard Boyd Barrett said: “I don’t trust the European Union, Mr Barnier.”

Today was all about smiles and niceties – and there were plenty more to be had over at Government Buildings in the afternoon when Enda Kenny welcomed Barnier to his office.
Harking back to the international headlines, Barnier was in the company of the very people the foreign press said he was in the same league as now. Surrounded by photos of Enda Kenny meeting important figures like Barack Obama, Nelson Mandela, Queen Elizabeth, and a sculpted bust of JFK on the mantelpiece, Barnier signed the guest book.

Flanked by a painting of Michael Collins, another man who had struggles with Britain over borders, and the spectacular landscape of a Paul Henry painting, the Taoiseach said Barnier understands Ireland and its concerns very well.
We hope he does – for all our sake.

You can catch up with all that here:
Will they refuse to stand again, we can only wait and see.
Ceann Comhairle reads the prayer out and there is a 30 second moment of silence, but all six of yesterday’s protesters are absent. So, no one is sitting for the prayer today.
Why didn’t the Garda Commissioner tell the Justice Minister about what she new about the finances at Templemore Garda College, asks Micheál Martin.
Enda Kenny says he has every confidence in Noirin O’Sullivan, and says a number of reviews are underway.
He says this relates to matters that happened some years ago – and the commissioner is back before the PAC in July.
“You cannot wash this thing away, week after week – do you not get it,” asks Martin.
The Fianna Fáil leader says O’Sullivan’s position is now untenable.
This requires urgent action, says Martin.
He says the Taoiseach is in a paralysis of inaction and calls for him to act now.

Enda Kenny again says this whole debacle relates to something that happened a number of years ago – reiterating the commissioners words that this is a “legacy” issue in the gardaí.
Here’s a bit more information for you on the controversy:
He said the PAC needs to be allowed to do its job and said the commissioner will be able to give her answers on 13 July.
All is not well here, admits the Taoiseach, but said it is the this commissioner that is taking action to sort it out.
He said the PAC should be allowed to do its job and says the Tánaiste has no difficulty in coming in and answering questions on the matter.
Adams tells the Taoiseach that he doesn’t seem to want to do anything about the commissioner before he leaves office.
Micheal Healy Rae is talking about the level of crime happening in Kerry. He said the elderly around the country are living in fear.
(He raised the issue last week also)
He says a local Tipperary man, Mr Campion (aged 94) and his wife (aged 87) were recently attacked in their home in Roscrea.
“They broke his walking stick over his head, they ransacked his home and stole his money,” said Healy Rae.
“These people are scumbags,” he said.
He said this type of behaviour by any human being is deplorable.
“You are cowards, you are horrible blaggards,” he added, and called on the government to step up and do more. He said people that do such acts should be tagged for life.
Enda Kenny said this is a case of “cowardice and unwanted brutality”. The Taoiseach what state of mind these people were in. He questioned how anyone could do such a thing to an elderly couple.

“To do that to an elderly person is unforgivable in so many ways,” said Kenny
“Please get cross about this issue,” said Healy Rae, who added it is not just or fair.
The Taoiseach said Operation Thor carried out by the gardaí is cracking down on crime, and said there are a number of legislation changes that impact on new bail rules.
Eamon Ryan of the Green Party is lambasting the Taoiseach over Ireland’s failures to reach its carbon emissions target.
He says there was political commitment when they were in government, and says this government is not taking the issue seriously enough.

He also says he heard Ryan is willing to “get into bed” with any political party.
Kenny says the greatest technological minds are working on this issue.
The Taoiseach asks: ‘Do you not appreciate the difficulties when you are trying to do something like this.’ (in terms of cycle ways, new roadways etc)
He says Ireland is a litigious country and the State can’t just go around buying up farms with CPOs.
“We are not working hard enough,” says Ryan.
Ryan said the Metro project was in the back when he was in government – the funding was there, he said, even during a time of some of the toughest budgets.
“You’re minister killed it,” he tells the Taoiseach.
Ryan says he lacks ambition when it comes to rolling out large-scale projects that could help.

The chance might come again for you, deputy Ryan, to play your part, says the Taoiseach.

SOCIAL PROTECTION MINISTER Leo Varadkar has said he’s relaxed about the expected leadership contest in Fine Gael.
To be more precise, he said he was “totally zen” about the issue, and that he would set out his plans for the future of the party once a vacancy arose.

Taoiseach Enda Kenny said in advance of his March trip to Washington that he would address the issue of his leadership “conclusively” after he returned.
However, speaking in New York on that St Patrick’s Day trip – after his visit to the White House – he insisted there were other priorities he had to deal with.
During a press conference on a Canadian trip last week, Kenny admonished an Irish journalist for asking about his plans to step down, telling the Irish Examiner’s Daniel McConnell “I can’t believe actually that you have travelled this distance to ask a question like that”.
The Fine Gael parliamentary party meets again tonight, but sources in the party say it’s unlikely Kenny will make any major announcement.
Asked when he expected the Taoiseach to make his plans known, Varadkarsaid on Morning Ireland:
Brian LawlessBrian Lawless
The Dublin TD’s main rival for the leadership, Housing Minister Simon Coveney, used similar language about the Taoiseach’s expected announcement back in March, telling Drivetime he was “pretty relaxed” about Kenny’s New York comments.
Summer campaign?
There’s been speculation the contest won’t begin until the start of the Dáil break – however, speaking at the weekend, according to the Irish Times, Coveney suggested the formal contest could begin before TDs rise for the summer.
One Fine Gael politician, speaking at Leinster House yesterday, said the Taoiseach would be wise to go soon before another scandal surfaces, in order to “go out on a high” and protect his legacy.
Asked about his campaigning efforts within the party today, Varadkar insisted he was “doing my day job pretty hard”, but conceded he was also shoring up support around the country.
He had been out meeting members and councillors, he said – as he always does. “Obviously there’s a new context to it now and I’m not going to pretend otherwise.”
A poll of the 73 members of the FG parliamentary party carried outby RTÉ’s Martina Fitzgeraldthis week found that 23 would support Varadkar. 13 said they would prefer Coveney.

Fine Gael elects its leader through an electoral college system with votes weighted according to a member’s status in the party.
The parliamentary party (TDs, Senators and MEPs) accounts for 65% of the overall vote, councillors have 10% of the vote and ordinary members have 25%. To be a candidate you must be nominated by at least a tenth of the parliamentary party.

SENATOR AND PIETA House founder Joan Freeman has strongly criticised Taoiseach Enda Kenny for taking part in last weekend’s Darkness Into Light event in Toronto, saying she was surprised he had “the neck” to do it.
In the Seanad today, Freeman referenced a report in yesterday’s Irish Times which said that Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin had written to Kenny criticising a cut to mental health services.
The senator, who was elected to the Seanad by Kenny last year, said that it was a “little ironic” that he took part in the suicide awareness event amidst these reports of cuts to mental health services.
However, Freeman had actually tweeted praise for the Taoiseach for his role in the Toronto event on Saturday.
Wonderful to see our Taoiseach participating Darkness to Light in Toronto#DIL2017https://t.co/KVusyVWTiy— Joan Freeman (@SenJoanFreeman)May 6, 2017Joan Freeman/ Twitter
Wonderful to see our Taoiseach participating Darkness to Light in Toronto#DIL2017https://t.co/KVusyVWTiy
She told the chamber: “The Taoiseach took part in Darkness into Light in Canada on Saturday morning.  It was shown around the whole world that he was participating in this walk.
At this point, she was interrupted by Fine Gael’s Jerry Buttimer who repeatedly insisted that the mental health budget increased, rather than decreased in the last budget.
When she was afforded the opportunity to speak again, Freeman said: “The €35 million I am talking about was reduced to €15 million this year.  That is grossly unfair.
Sinn Féin Senator Pádraig MacLochlainn spoke up in support of Freeman, saying that she is “better qualified than anyone else in the House to say what the gaps are in terms of mental health”.
“All that she is asking that she would be present at a meeting with the Taoiseach to discuss those gaps,” he said.
Buttimer, meanwhile, said that he “disagreed profoundly” with Freeman. He defended the Minister of State, Helen McEntee, who he said has “put her life and soul into the mental health area”. He added:
He added that a cross-party approach to mental health was needed, but that wasn’t quite the case at the moment.
At Budget time, Health Minister Simon Harris said he would allocate €35 million more to the mental health budget next year.
However, responding to a question by Fianna Fáil’s James Browne, Minister of State for Mental Health Helen McEntee had said just €15 million would be available for 2017.
AJournal.ieFactCheck showed that the government had, in fact, not cut mental health funding inBudget 2017.
SOCIAL PROTECTION MINSTER Leo Varadkar has said the media should not try “to embarrass” the Taoiseach when he is abroad by asking him questions about his leadership.
While on a trade trip to Canada last week,Enda Kenny was asked by the Irish Examiner newspaperwhen he will step down as Taoiseach.
Clearly unhappy with the question, he replied: “I can’t believe that you travelled this distance to ask a question like that.”
Today, Varadkar (potentially the next Taoiseach) was asked whether he agrees with Enda Kenny that the Taoiseach should not be asked about leadership issues while on a foreign trade mission.
He said:
Leadership
“I agree with the Taoiseach, but I also think ministers shouldn’t be asked about it domestically, because we are always asked about it whether we raise it as an issue or not,” he continued.
Varadkar went on to say that he has never travelled abroad with the media pack, and does not have much experience of how it works.
Poll results
The latest poll (carried out by RTÉ’s Martina Fitzgerald) indicates that Varadkar is ahead of his probable running mate, Housing Minister Simon Coveney in the Fine Gael leadership battle.
Varadkar said the polls indicating he is ahead in the race are “encouraging”.
While the contest rumbles on behind the scenes, party members await to hear from the Taoiseach as to when he is stepping down.
Questions about his leadership revved up after he said he would make his position known following the St Patrick’s Day visit to Washington. But that trip has obviously come and gone.
He also said he’d stay on to see through talks in the North and the start of Brexit negotiations (which have now both been delayed because of theelection in the UK).
Kenny has said he will inform Fine Gael deputies before telling the Dáil, and there is widespread speculation that he could do this at next week’s parliamentary party meeting.
While there is a meeting tomorrow night, he is not expected to overshadow the visit of European Chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair this week, by announcing his resignation.

AN OPINION POLL indicates many people in the Fine Gael parliamentary party have yet to decide who they will vote for in the party’s leadership contest, or don’t wish to share their preference.
Of the 73 members of the parliamentary party, 62 responded (85%) to the poll,which was carried out by RTÉ News.
The poll is good news for Social Protection Leo Varadkar, with 23 people saying they’ll support his bid to become the next Taoiseach, while 13 members would prefer Housing Minister Simon Coveney to succeed Enda Kenny.

However, 26 members said they have not yet decided or do not wish to indicate who they’re backing – meaning the race could still go either way.
Fine Gael’s parliamentary party consists of 50 TDs, 19 senators and four MEPs.
How they vote in the leadership contest will account for 65% of the outcome, while the votes of ordinary members make up 25% and councillors’ votes account for 10%.
DO YOU THINK there should be an election held after the Fine Gael leadership contest ends?
Although a leadership challenge hasn’t officially begun, Taoiseach Enda Kenny has said that he will step aside as head of government.
The frontrunners for the next leader of the party are Minister for Social Protection Leo Varadkar and housing minister Simon Coveney.
A survey by RTÉ’sMartina Fitzgeraldshows that of 85% of the parliamentary party who were asked, 23 said they would support Varadkar while 13 would prefer Coveney.
Some say that a new leader would warrant an election, as there will be a new Taoiseach based on who the Fine Gael party choose.
Others say that there’s no public appetite for an election, and political stability is needed to put Ireland on sure footing for Brexit negotiations.

TAOISEACH ENDA KENNY has sought to clarify the government’s position on women’s rights today, but has not said whether or not Ireland voted to allow Saudi Arabia on an international committee about women’s rights.
Speaking today in Canada, the Taoiseach said that he had raised the issue of human rights with Saudi authorities while on a trade mission there, but it was Minister for Foreign Affairs Charlie Flanagan who had raised the specific issue of women’s rights in subsequent meetings.
It has been revealed that five European countries voted for Saudi Arabia onto the UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW), despite the country being perceived as regressive to women’s rights because of a guardianship system that requires women to ask for permission from a male family member to work or study.
Belgium was one of the countries to vote for the Saudis, and its government has apologised and said it would vote differently if given the opportunity.
In a statement yesterday, Flanagan said that Ireland’s votes in the UN remain a secret as this represents “good functioning of the UN, which is made up of member states of very different views and political backgrounds”.
He said that it would be “damaging” for Ireland and “irresponsible” of him if he were to disclose how Ireland voted in this or any other case.
“At my own initiative”
A spokesperson for the Taoiseach said that this “government’s concern for women’s rights is without question and has been demonstrated on many occasions”.
The spokesperson said that Ireland’s strong reputation in promoting gender equality was reflected through the fact that the country assumes the chair of the CSW.
They pointed to statements made by the Taoiseach during the trade mission to Canada today, as clarifying his position on the issue:
However, speaking to reporters during a joint press conference with Canadian leader Justin Trudeau yesterday, Kenny had appeared to suggest that hehadraised the issue of women’s rights directly during his Saudi visit.
He said that he had ”raised the question of women’s rights with the Saudi Arabians when I was there myself a number of years ago on a trade mission”.
At that same press conference, the Taoiseach told an Irish journalist “I can’t believe that you travelled this distance to ask a question like that”when asked when he would step down.
OK WE’VE ALREADY come to the conclusion that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is a real life Disney prince.

BY NOW, ENDA Kenny is used to receiving questions on when he will step down as Taoiseach, from both journalists and politicians.
But he was surprised to get one during an official visit to Canada yesterday – telling an Irish journalist “I can’t believe that you travelled this distance to ask a question like that”.
Although he’s mentioned it a number of times that he will leave, the Taoiseach has avoided answering when he’ll go, or even when he will announce his departure date.
Kenny said he’d step aside after thegarda whistleblowercontroversy earlier this year, but has said he’d stay on to see through talks in the North and the start of Brexit negotiations (which have been delayed because of theelection in the UK).
Chistos Dogas / RollingNews.ieChistos Dogas / RollingNews.ie / RollingNews.ie
Kenny missed the Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting this week because of histrip to Montréalto meet with Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, where he was expected to be asked about his departure.
When asked by the Irish Examiner’s Daniel McConnell when he would be stepping down as Taoiseach, Enda Kenny seemed to get annoyed.
“I have come here to meet with the Canadian prime minister and Canadian business to explore the opportunities that exist across the Atlantic for the creation of jobs and investment and to the benefit of Canadians and Irish people.
“That is my business here. Next question.”
When McConnell explained that the question was being asked on behalf of all Irish media, Kenny replied: “I just said to you I can’t believe you have travelled this distance to ask a question like that.”
Later, a spokesman for Kenny told the Examiner that the Taoiseach had not been angry or had lashed out.
Meanwhile, Trudeau’s footwear was drawing attention online.
The young leader wore mismatched Star Wars socks to his meeting with Enda to mark May the Fourth, (a play on words for the Star Wars mantra, May the Force be With You).
He even tweeted out a picture of his R2D2 and C3PO socks.

Who’s up next?
Back home, members of the Independent Alliance have said they have no preference as to who the next Taoiseach should be as long as they honour the programme for government.
Marking their first year in government at a press conference yesterday in Government Buildings, the group unanimously said they could work with either Leo Varadkar or Simon Coveney – the two front runners in the Fine Gael leadership race.
“I have a great relationship with both men and I wish them well,” said Kevin ‘Boxer’ Moran, the soon to be the Minister for State at the OPW.
Junior Minister for Skills John Halligan and Junior Minister for Disabilities Finian McGrath said they had an excellent relationship with both men.

Leo or Simon?
Transport Minister Shane Ross said who the next leader of Fine Gael will be is a matter for the party, but did say any changeover would be an opportune time to talk about new ideas.
“We have no intention of going out and aggressively demanding all sorts of new things. It will be an opportunity to refresh and to implement new ideas.”
While he did not specify what new ideas the Independent Alliance have in mind, it’s understood the group will ask for a few extra items for their group when a new Taoiseach is voted in. However, a total overhaul of the government programme is not on the cards.
“It is certainly not to us who is the next leader,” said Transport Minster Shane Ross, who added that they have no intention of making “aggressive” demands.
He said the Independent Alliance are more concerned with implementing what is already in the programme for government, before adding to it.
Reshuffle
It’s believed that whoever becomes the next Taoiseach may want to make a few changes in Cabinet.
Speaking to the media yesterday, the members of the Independent Alliance said they are all very happy with their portfolios and don’t expect to be moved from them.
“I am really delighted where I am – I definitely need three years to get some of the things done,” said McGrath.
All the members of the group, excluding John Halligan, said they will be running in the next general election, if and when that is.
“I’m not too sure to be honest, I’ll have to have a think about that,” said Halligan.

THOSE ARE THE words of Peter Fitzpatrick, one of the founding members of Our Children’s Health – a voluntary campaign that has fought for three years for automatic medical cards for all children diagnosed with a serious illness.
In 2014,due to the falling numbers of discretionary medical cardsbeing awarded, the group was launched.
They began demonstrating outside Government Buildings with a 20 foot banner, pledging to be thereevery day until the situation was resolved.
At the time, Taoiseach Enda Kenny met the groupand told the campaigners that he planned to do something about it, telling them: “This isn’t the Ireland we all know.”
The group called on the government to amend the Health Act of 1970 so that any child diagnosed with a serious illness or congenital condition is automatically entitled to a full medical card.
In five days,over 50,000 people had signed their petition.
Today, after a three-year struggle and hundreds of days protesting, the group reached their end goal.

Minister for Health Simon Harris together with Minister of State for Disabilities Finian McGrath today announced the opening of the registration for a medical cards for all children in respect of whom the Domiciliary Care Allowance is paid.
This will benefit approximately 9,800 children who do not currently qualify for a medical card.
“It’s just such a huge relief to have reached this point. It means there won’t be a question mark anymore over 33,000 children who have severe disabilities in Ireland that now have healthcare as an automatic right. We always thought that should be automatic. There shouldn’t have been a question mark – that question mark has been taken away,” said Fitzpatrick.
The changes to the law also mean families will not have the burden of regular reviews by the HSE, whereby they were asked to provide documentation and proof of their child’s condition upon review of the card.
“All the reviews added huge stress on to parents… that is all done away with now, you have the card for 16 years – no questions asked, it is exactly what we were looking for at the start,” said Fitzpatrick.
While there had been a delay in delivering the scheme, Fitzpatrick said he was relieved today has finally arrived.
Speaking about the delay he said there wasn’t enough funding put aside for the roll-out.
“They put aside €10 million – it was estimated to cost €17 to €20 million, so they couldn’t discharge it till June – but we are here now and it has happened in the end.

Harris urged all parents and guardians of eligible children who do not currently hold a medical card or GP visit card to avail of the registration process early, either online atwww.medicalcard.ieor by paper application form so that medical cards can be certified for use from 1 June.
“This is a significant day for the parents and guardians of children with disabilities. I have met many people during my tenure as Minister of State for Disabilities and I am acutely aware of the daily struggles that they face. Provision of these medical cards will go some way to help to alleviate the stress and anxiety of parents and guardians who are dealing with the medical costs associated with a child’s disability,” said McGrath.

THE FIRST GOVERNMENT TD to call for Taoiseach Enda Kenny to step down, Dublin Fingal’s Alan Farrell, has said that the sooner Kenny’s future is sorted out the better it will be for the party.
Speaking toRTÉ’s Morning Irelandtoday,  Farrell said that given the parameters for Brexit negotiations have now been agreed at European Council level, it is likely the issue of both Fine Gael’s and the country’s leadership will now be addressed.
In February, Farrell becamethe first Fine Gael TD to publicly declare Kenny’s leadership as being untenablein the wake of a gaffe-filled week regarding the government’s handling of the Maurice McCabe whistleblower controversy.
That controversy has since blossomed into a full-blown tribunal, chaired by Justice Peter Charleton, which began its hearings recently.
At a European Council meeting this weekend, Kenny appeared to dodge the issue of his leadership by answering a question on the subject in Irish, saying “I will talk to my party soon”.
Speaking this morning, Farrell dismissed the idea that the Taoiseach is deliberately stalling.
“I’m not convinced that it’s a deliberate tactic,” he said.
Farrell (most recently in the news himself for kicking off a sustained scandal involving Sinn Féin in early December by suggesting that two of their TDs had knowledge concerning the death of prison officer Brian Stackat the hands of the IRA in 1984), added that the fact Kenny is both Taoiseach and leader of Fine Gael creates an “added incentive” for the matter to be resolved.
“I imagine this will place the parliamentary party in a difficult position as we will continue to talk about the issue from the media’s perspective which would serve as a distraction to our parliamentary business,” he said.

Updated 5.15pm
EUROPEAN UNION LEADERS have unanimously adopted their Brexit strategy at a special summit in Brussels today, in a show of unity ahead of two years of tough talks with Britain.
The 27 leaders quickly agreed on the negotiating guidelines as they met without Britain for the first time since Prime Minister Theresa May triggered the divorce process a month ago.
They say talks on a future trade deal with Britain can only start once London agrees divorce terms on citizens’ rights, its exit bill and Northern Ireland.
The leaders have backed an agreement that would see Northern Ireland automatically rejoin the EU if it votes to reunite with the Republic.
TwitterTwitter
Taoiseach Enda Kenny said that he was “very pleased” with the outcome of the talks, saying that they reflected their priorities: to protect the Peace Process, avoid a hard border, and maintain the Common Travel Area.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Charlie Flanagan welcomed the outcome, saying Ireland’s concerns have been “reflected prominently” in the EU’s position for the upcoming Brexit negotiations.
“Guidelines adopted unanimously. EU27 firm and fair political mandate for the Brexit talks is ready,” EU President Donald Tusk said on Twitter, shortly after the summit began.
TwitterTwitter
Leaders adopted the guidelines, unchanged, within one minute, an EU source said.
Tusk earlier urged the bloc to keep a united front, saying it will also help Britain if they can reach a deal.
“We need to remain united as the EU 27. It is only then that we will be able to conclude the negotiations, which means that our unity is also in the UK’s interest,” he said.
‘Cost for Britain’
French President Francois Hollande said as he arrived that “the aim of the summit is unity”, adding: “There will inevitably be a price and a cost for Britain.”
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the EU wants “good relations” with Britain but added that “we also want to defend, at 27, our common interests – so far we have done extremely well”.
The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the bloc had a “clear line” on the talks.
The EU 27 have considerably toughened the guidelines since Tusk first unveiled them a month ago, with Brussels also drawing up a detailed list of citizens’ rights.
Tusk said this issue – the fate of three million EU citizens living in Britain and one million Britons on the continent – “must be number-one priority for EU and the UK”.
Officials hope for agreement on this by the end of the year.
‘Illusions’
The leaders will also discuss the relocation of EU medical and banking agencies that are currently based in London.
EU guidelines say that only when “sufficient progress” has been made on divorce issues can these trade talks begin, with sources saying they hope to do that by the end of the year.
EU leaders were discussing how to define this progress after approving the guidelines at the summit, officials said.
Tusk’s call for a united front comes hot on the heels of a war of words between Merkel and May over the negotiations.
Merkel said Britain should not have “illusions” about getting favourable treatment, but May hit back by accusing the EU 27 of planning to “line up to oppose us”.

TAOISEACH ENDA KENNY gave his first indication following the Citizen’s Assembly vote at the weekend that a referendum on abortion will be held in Ireland.
Kenny said if there is any change to the Constitution it will of course require a referendum, adding that there must be clear legislation to support whatever referendum result is delivered.
In 2015, the Taoiseach said there wouldnot be a referendum on the Eighth amendment“in the lifetime of this government” – however, since the establishment of the Citizen’s Assembly Kenny’s go-to line to those who ask for the repeal of the Eighth Amendment has been – what would you replace it with?
Citizen’s Assembly vote
The Citizen’s Assemblyhave now answered that questionfor the Taoiseach by voting that the Oireachtas should be given the power to legislate for the termination of pregnancy and this should replace, not repeal the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution.
It also recommended a provision that the Oireachtas must legislate for abortion, and that terminations should be allowed without restriction up to the 12th week of pregnancy, amongst other things.
“At the end of the day, when people go to vote in a referendum they vote for either yes or no – so the important element there is the legislation that underpins that, what that means and what the consequences of voting either yes or no for that piece of legislation would mean. A lot of discussion will take place around that in the time ahead,” said the Taoiseach.
Since the result, anumber of ministersincluding Frances Fitzgerald and Simon Harris have said they would like to see a referendum next year.
Kenny toldTheJournal.iethis afternoon that it is now “a matter of explaining to people what were the issues the Citizen’s Assembly deliberated upon, what decisions did they made and what might those decisions actually mean”.
He commended the work of the Assembly’s chairperson, Ms Justice Laffoy, stating that she conducted her role “expertly, very competently and very professionally”.
“We owe her a debt of gratitude,” he said.
He also paid tribute to the 99 people who served on the Assembly and said many of them have told him they found it to be a “wonderful experience”.
Setting up the committee
The Taoiseach said the Assembly’s report will now be sent to the special Oireachtas committee
“I hope we can get set up in the next week or fortnight as agreed with 20 members of the Dáil and Seanad and they will receive that report and then we can move on to having the report debated and discussed,” he said.
Many of the parties such as Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already asked their party members to submit applications of interest to sit on the committee. The deadline for applications is understood to be tomorrow.
The two prime ministers will meet next Thursday.PA imagesPA images
TAOISEACH ENDA KENNY is to travel to Canada next week for a three-day visit where he will meet his Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau.
Kenny will be in Canada from 3-5 May and will meet Trudeau in the city of Montréal next Thursday.
The office of the Canadian prime minister confirmed the visit yesterday and said that the pair would discuss areas of common interest includingthe CETA trade agreementbetween the EU and Canada.
“Ireland is a close friend, and I look forward to meeting with Taoiseach Kenny to further deepen this relationship,” Trudeau said in a statement.

An Taoiseach’s schedule for the Canadian trip sees him meet with Trudeau on the morning of 4 May before he attends a lunch with the Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Montreal.
That evening he will travel to Toronto where he will be a guest at a dinner hosted by Enterprise Ireland.
The following day the Taoiseach will stay in Toronto and will attend business and tourism functions before an evening dinner hosted by the Ireland Fund.
The Canadian prime minister’s office notes that the Irish-Canadian community is one of the country’s largest ethnic groups in the country with more than 4.5 million Canadians claiming Irish ancestry.
Merchandise trade between the two nations was €1.62 billion last year with Canadian foreign direct investment in Ireland estimated at €9.43 billion in 2015.
In that same year, Irish FDI in Canada was estimated at €4.24 billion.
BRENDAN HOWLIN HAS hit out at Labour’s former coalition partner Fine Gael in his keynote speech at the party’s national conference.
Howlin is trying to rebuild the party after it lost 30 seats in last year’s general election, the worst result in its history.
The Labour leader didn’t hold back in his speech, describing the current government a “sham” and Fine Gael as “right-wing” in terms of austerity and the economy.
“Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and a rag-bag of independents show no ambition and they seem quite content about it.
“Leo [Varadkar] and Simon [Coveney] square up to each other (in the Fine Gael leadership battle). Playing to their base – dragging the country further to the right.
“Running a false election based on tax cuts and shutting down Bus Éireann. Dog-whistles to their supporters on the right, pitting the private sector against the public sector once more.
“Meanwhile, Enda [Kenny] and (Fianna Fáil leader) Micheál are content to play for time.”
Howlin also hit out at Transport Minister Shane Ross, stating: “We saw weeks of industrial action in Bus Éireann, while Lord Ross twiddled his thumbs, sitting in his office hiding. No more selfies on the bus.
“A Minister for Transport content to do nothing, concerned about the Stepaside Garda station, but caring little about the buses in Cork, or Limerick or Galway. The dysfunction at the heart of this government helps nobody and it hurts many.”
Donald Trump
Internationally, Howlin warned about the prospect of far-right Marine Le Pen winning the French presidential election, in which votingis taking place today, and was critical of Brexit and US President Donald Trump.
He said: “Sometimes, it feels like a dark wind is blowing across the world. For many of us on this island, it all seems strange and maybe more than a little scary. Brexit happened. Trump happened.
“The French people go to the polls against the backdrop of yet another horrific terrorist attack, and Le Pen might yet happen.
Howlin was sharply critical of Trump, saying: “He’s a racist, a sexist and a homophobe. He doesn’t have the temperament or patience to run the world’s greatest power.
“He’s a danger to us all. He is already waging war on the environment. When he promises to ramp up the burning of coal, he gives false hope to those who have worked in mines and gives real hope to a powerful, dirty industry.”
Howlin described the Irish government’s draft climate plan as “spectacularly lacking”.
United Ireland
Howlin said “the path to a borderless Ireland after Brexit is far from clear” and “made worse by the Tory desire for parliamentary domination”.
He added that he hopes to see a united Ireland one day.
“Historically, partition has been bad for both north and south. Instead of living together, we created two narrow, sectarian states.
“Neither has worked as it should. I’d love to see a united Ireland that is an agreed Ireland, one that unites hearts and minds, as much as territory.”
‘Hope is what we do’
Howlin also spoke about Labour’s desire to repeal, and not replace or amend, the Eighth Amendment so women in Ireland have access to abortion.
Speaking about emigration and job creation, Howlin said: “For many generations, there has been a social contract. That contract meant that every family could believe in one simple idea: Work hard and your children will have a better life than you.
“They feel afraid for their children. They worry they will have to emigrate and that they won’t be able to afford a home. Young people in their 20s wonder will they have job security or a decent quality of life or a health system that works or a roof over their heads.
“It’s our job to change that because, for Labour, hope is what we do. Hope to take on the challenges that lie ahead.”
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of people attended Ireland’s newest artistic festival, Cruinniú na Cásca today.
Free events took place around the country to celebrate Irish culture, with RTÉ reporting that some 550,000 people were in attendance.
The festival follows on from last year’s 1916 commemorations, and is presented by RTÉ in association with Creative Ireland.
While many events took place nationwide, large-scale celebrations took place in Dublin, at St Stephen’s Green, Custom House Quay, Smithfield and Dublin Castle.
There was singing, dancing, and music on the streets – and even the Taoiseach was getting involved.

While this is the first year of Cruinniú na Cásca, it’s expected it will become an annual event.

THE NATIONAL FLAG will now be illuminated and fly 24/7 outside Government Buildings.
To mark the 101st anniversary of the Easter Rising, a short flag raising ceremony took place on Friday in the courtyard of Government Buildings in the presence of the Taoiseach and staff of the department.
In accordance with the guidelines governing the use of the national flag it is normally displayed in the open only from sunrise to sunset, except on the occasion of public meetings, processions or funerals, when it may be displayed for the duration of such function.

However, the guidelines provide that the tricolour may be flown by night as well as by day as long as it is properly illuminated at all times.
The installation of spotlights will now enable the the flag to be flown at all times outside Government Buildings.
Speaking at the ceremony of Taoiseach Enda Kenny said last year’s commemorations brought about a newfound respect for the tricolour.

He commended the Defence Forces for their professionalism in delivering a national flag to every school in Ireland last year and for explaining the meaning of the tricolour to the school children.
Kenny said he believes it is really important to have the flag flying on the grounds of Government Buildings.

“The national flag from this day and this night will always fly here and be respected by the people of this country.”
The Irish flag was first introduced by Thomas Francis Meagher in 1848 who based it on French tricolour.
The green represents the older Gaelic tradition while the orange represents the supporters of William of Orange. The white in the centre signifies a lasting truce between the orange and the green.
It was not until the Easter Rising of 1916, when it was raised above the General Post Office in Dublin that the tricolour came to be regarded as the national flag.
It is now enshrined in the Constitution of Ireland.

THE DEATH HAS occurred of former US ambassador to Ireland Dan Rooney.
He was 84.
Serving as US President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Ireland between 2009 and 2012, Rooney was also well-known in American football circles as owner and chairman of the Pittsburgh Steelers NFL team.
Rooney was the son of Art Rooney, himself the owner of the Steelers, and was heavily involved in all aspects of the franchise since childhood.
His spearheading of an initiative to require all NFL teams to interview minority candidates for senior coaching jobs led to its adoption in 2003. It became known as the Rooney Rule.

In March 2009 Obama nominated Rooney as ambassador to Ireland, a role he was confirmed for in July of that year.
Rooney’s Irish connections could be traced back to the town of Newry in Co Down.
Speaking this evening, President Michael D Higgins said he had “heard with sadness of the passing of Dan Rooney”.
“Sabina and I remember Ambassador Rooney and his family’s visit to us in Áras an Uachtaráin with fondness,” he said.
Taoiseach Enda Kenny meanwhile commented that he was “deeply saddened” to learn of Rooney’s passing, adding that “Dan was a personal friend of mine”.
TAOISEACH ENDA KENNY  has called a security meeting today arising from the terrorist attack in Sweden and the bomb attack on a bus transporting the Borussia Dortmund football team to a Champions League.
“These are things that we cannot be distant from. We are a non-aligned, non-aggressive country and though the threat is always present, it is not at a high level in Ireland and we try to keep it that way,” he said.
Kenny said the gardaí are monitoring a small number of individuals “who do not have this country’s interests at heart”.
The Taoiseach was answering questions in the Dáil yesterday about what Ireland’s national emergency management plan is in the case of a terrorist attack or natural disaster.
National emergency
Fianna Fáil’s Micheál Martin said the current national arrangements for emergency management have effectively been left unchanged since it was first introduced by Willie O’Dea a decade ago.
This is despite the fact the scale and nature of potential emergencies has evolved dramatically since then, he argued.
“It is the consistent model internationally that the prime minister’s office takes the lead responsibility. I believe it is time for us to review our structures and implement appropriate legislation,” said Martin.

‘Up its game’
Labour leader Brendan Howlin said Ireland needed to “up its game” in terms of protections against terrorist attacks.
“I believe we need to think beyond just those sorts of incidents. Please God there will not be an explosion or mishap in a nuclear institution in Britain, but we have to plan for that.
“A much more likely attack is a possible terrorist attack. We would be foolish to think that we are immune from that in this jurisdiction. I know that An Garda Síochána monitor some people in this country and so on. We need to up our game on this whole area,” said the Wexford TD.
Howlin said the cyber-security area is where Ireland is probably most prone to attack.
“It could cripple us,” he said.
Over the years, all of our Government departments have been subject to cyber attacks, said Howlin. He said that some of these attacks had not got into the public domain.
“I take the Deputy’s point, for instance, in respect of cyber attacks. We now have such an enormous investment in digitisation in so many companies around the country. This is an issue that needs to be looked at,” said the Taoiseach.
Howlin told the Dáil that when an emergency happens in Britain, what is known as Cobra, the Cabinet Office emergency unit, kicks in under the auspices of the British Prime Minister.
Britain's former Prime Minister David Cameron speaks during a Cobra meeting at Number 10 Downing Street in 2014.NEIL HALLNEIL HALL
“Is it appropriate that we would have our own prime ministerial command centre to deal with any emergency that might arise and to bring in the particular expertise we need? Is there a view that a Cobra-style office might at least be discussed?” he asked.
Cobra-style meeting
The Taoiseach said his department does not take the lead in such situations, but said if the nature of the emergency warranted a special Government meeting, the Taoiseach’s department would call such a Cobra-style meeting.
But he said the national emergency co-ordination group would take over in such an incident.
However, Kenny said there is a plan underway to update the emergency framework.
“The Office of Emergency Planning has prepared a draft document, entitled ‘Strategic Emergency Management – National Structures and Framework’. That is due to come to Government very shortly and we will publish it before the summer so people can reflect on the very issue,” said the Taoiseach.
Kenny said the updated paper will provide a “forum to discuss these central questions”.
Martin said he agreed with Howlin in regard to Ireland’s state of readiness in the context of a terrorist attack.
“We are far too complacent, as a country, in regard to that threat and we should do far more to prepare our responses.”
FIANNA FÁIL HAS tabled a motion calling on the Policing Authority to “assess the role and capacity” of the Garda Commissioner Noírín O’Sullivan in order to restore public confidence.
In recent weeks, the party has continually said it cannot express confidence in the commissioner after a litany of errors in the road traffic division were revealed.
Last month it was discovered that gardaí miscounted the number of breath tests they carried out over the past five years by almost one million.
It was also revealed that 146,856 summonses to court were wrongly issued to drivers over the past 10 years.
It resulted in the Commissioner being grilled about the phantom breath tests and court appearances in front of an Oireachtas committee, in which she conceded the two controversies highlight ‘at best, incompetence and, at worst, deception’.

Since the controversy, the government has announced that an independent expert will carry out a root-and-branch review of An Garda Síochána. The Policing Authority has been tasked with investigating the breath tests and false court summonses.
Increasing pressure
Fianna Fáil’s motion, which will be debated in Dáil next Tuesday, increases the pressure on the Commissioner and on the Policing Authority to take a leading role in the scandal.
While it calls for O’Sullivan’s capacity as Commissioner to be evaluated, it also calls for the government to give extra powers to the Policing Authority so it can discharge its functions.
There is strict legislation dictating that the Garda Commissioner can only be removed by Cabinet under certain circumstances. However, the Policing Authority can formallyrecommend the removal of the commissionerto the Government.
The authority is an independent body set up to oversee the performance of An Garda Síochána. It is not part of the An Garda Síochána or the Department of Justice and Equality.

Confidence in the Garda Commissioner
Both the Taoiseach Enda Kenny and Justice Minister Frances Fitzgerald have said they continue to have confidence in O’Sullivan.
Fianna Fáil’s motion “condemns” the latest garda scandal, but notes the parameters in which the Policing Authority can step in and recommend the Commissioner’s removal from office.
It also calls for the following:

Fianna Fáil is also calling for the full implementation of the Garda Inspectorate Reports of 2014 and 2015 within a tight time frame and for civilians to be recruited to senior managerial levels of the gardaí.
A debate on the motion will take place ahead of Sinn Féin’s motion of no confidence in the commissioner which comes before the Dáil on Wednesday.
ALAN SHATTER HAS said the Fennelly Commission report into non-emergency calls being recorded at garda stations shows the issue was “more cock-up than conspiracy”.
The long-awaited report waspublished yesterday.
Speaking onRTÉ’s Morning Ireland, the former Justice Minister was also critical of Taoiseach Enda Kenny and Attorney General Máire Whelan, saying their actions might be “a resigning matter”.
Shatter said: “The report does disclose substantial managerial dysfunction within An Garda Síochána, which is something that clearly should and must be addressed.
“But the report also confirms that Commissioner Martin Callinan, upon discovering the existence of these recordings, put a stop to them and preserved them, pending getting legal advice from the Attorney General’s office.
“And we now know, from the interim report and confirmed in this report, that the Attorney first received a reasonable and substantial briefing on this in November 2013, but failed to inform either me or the Taoiseach in late March 2014 of her knowledge going back to November 2013…
“The Attorney met with the Taoiseach on the evening of 23 March 2014, gave him what Fennelly regarded as very alarmist advice, advice that Fennelly concluded that she didn’t have adequate information to give.
“And, in circumstances where additional information was required, neither the Taoiseach nor the Attorney in the following 24 hours made any contact with me as Minister for Justice, in circumstances in which I was uniquely placed to contact the Garda Commissioner to see what additional information could be obtained.
“And it’s now absolutely clear that the alarm sounded by the Attorney General, as Fennelly recalls, that the jails would be thrown open, that the prosecutions would collapse, that miscarriages of justice had occurred, all of that, has proved to be a gross and serious misjudgement.”
Earlier on Morning Ireland, Labour leader Brendan Howlin defended Whelan, saying the alarm was justified at the time as people were unsure of how events would play out. Shatter said Howlin was looking at events “through a political filter” as Whelen is a member of the Labour Party.
‘A resigning matter’
During the interview, Shatter repeatedly questioned why neither Kenny nor Whelan contacted him at the time.
“Why did the Attorney General not forthrightly detail, either to me or the Taoiseach, her knowledge of events going back to November 2013? Why did the Attorney General not brief me or the Taoiseach or Cabinet on these issues after November 2013 and, most seriously of all, why did each of them give evidence to the Fennelly commission of investigation which Judge Fennelly rejected?
“I believe each of them have avoided addressing these issues pending the conclusion of Judge Fennelly’s report. I say this with a great deal of regret because when I resigned I paid tribute to both the Taoiseach and the Attorney General … They were very supportive of me in government.”
Shatter said he thinks Kenny needs to address the Dáil about the issue, adding that he isn’t sure if the opposition are willing to pursue this as some of them had promoted the “false narrative” that he was somehow involved in the phone tapping and “snooping” on people.
Last month, the Taoiseachrejected Shatter’s claimthat he had a “casual relationship with the truth”. At the time, a government statement rebuking Shatter referenced his resignation letter in which he said Kenny was “an extraordinary Taoiseach doing an extraordinary job”.
GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA Merkel promised to help Ireland protect its interests in Brexit negotiations as she met with Taoiseach Enda Kenny in Berlin today.
Kenny’s trip to Germany was his first European visit since the UK formally gave notice last week of its plans to leave the European Union.
The bloc’s biggest economy is a vital ally in any negotiations and as Merkel greeted Kenny today she could be heard say to him: “come in, I missed you.”
Inside as the two leaders gave statements to the press,RTÉ reports thatMerkel acknowledged that Ireland has a specific interest in Brexit negotiations.
“We are all familiar with the situation of Ireland, and with the very, very important issues of war and peace,” she said.

Speaking in Brussels in February, Kenny made clear that any Brexit deal must include a provision to allow Northern Ireland to rejoin the EU should reunification with the Republic ever happen.
Kenny has previously made the comparison of Irish reunification with that of German reunification and pointed out that, in that case East Germany, it did not have to apply to join the EU when it was absorbed into West Germany.

Speaking at today’s press briefing, Kenny said that any agreements with respect to Ireland must honour EU law.
“This is a political problem and we will have to be both creative and imaginative in dealing with it,” he said.
“Whatever is agreed of course Chancellor, will have to be compatible with European Union law. But we must not get lost in the technical detail at this stage and lose sight of the principal objective of maintaining peace.”

THE LONG AWAITED report of the Fennelly Commission is being published today.
The report is one of a string of garda-related reports that have beeninstituted and published over the last numberof years, this one was established just over three years ago.
But what’s it all about?
During the discovery process for Ian Bailey’s case against the State over his arrest for the Sophie Toscan Du Plantier murder, tapes ofhundreds of phone conversationsfrom garda stations came to light.
Although the practice was known, the systematic nature of it was not.
Its extent around the country back to the 1980s and how widespread it was raised questions about who knew what about it.
The nature of the recordings became publicknowledge in March 2014 when it was announcedby the government.
In revealing the system, the government immediately announced thata statutory Commission of Investigationwas being established to look into the matter.
A member of the judiciary was to lead it and Justice Nial Fennelly was subsequently selected.

The day the revelations about the recording systems came to light, garda commissioner Martin Callinan resigned.
Callinan had already been under pressure due to his handling of a number of different whistleblowers, but the timing of his resignation in coinciding with the taping revelations raised eyebrows.

In a letter from Callinan to Shatter that was not seen by the justice minister until two weeks after it was sent, Callinan confirmed that gardaí had set up a working group to look at the recordings in November 2013.
The Taoiseach became aware of the situationthrough Attorney General Máire Whelan, but the AG did not inform the justice minister.
Subsequently, the Taoiseach sent Department of Justice secretary general Brian Purcell to Callinan’s home to inform him about the seriousness with which the government was taking the matter.
The next day Callinan resigned.
A previous interim report from Fennelly concluded that Callinan felt he had no choice but to resign his position as Garda Commissioner after Purcell’s visit, but it stopped short of saying the Taoiseach dismissed him.
A number of subsequent interim reports from the Fennelly commission have been published and among the revelations were thatCallinan had eight to ten bags of his personal papers shreddedafter announcing his retirement.
The remainder of the report is expected to focus on the recording system at garda stations and will conclude whether criminal cases and convictions were affected.
FIANNA FÁIL IS considering tabling a motion of no confidence in the management of An Garda Síochána.
The move comes following strong criticism of the Garda Commissioner Noírín O’Sullivan at last night’s Fianna Fáil front bench meeting.
A litany of massive errors emerged last month which led to almost a million phantom breath tests being logged on the Pulse system and hundreds of thousands of drivers receiving summonses they should never have been sent.
Last night, Fianna Fáil reiterated its stance that it cannot express confidence in the commissioner. There was also criticism of the commissioner’s performance at an Oireachtas committee meeting last week.
Sinn Féin’s motion of no confidence in the commissioner is due before the Dáil on 12 April – however, Fianna Fáill are not expected to support it.
It’s understood that Fianna Fáil are considering their own motion, or, if the Labour Party are receptive to the wording, both parties may join forces to bring forward such a motion.
This would most likely be heard in May.
Labour leader Brendan Howlin questioned the Taoiseach in the Dáil today, asking if the government can continue to have confidence in garda management.
“I retain confidence in the commissioner,” said Taoiseach Enda Kenny.
Removal from office
Fianna Fáil’s Sean Fleming confirmed toNewstalk Breakfastthis morning the party has said if Fianna Fáil was in government it would remove her from office.
O’Sullivan is due back in Leinster House later this month to appear before the Oireachtas Committee on Justice. She will face questions in relation to the breath tests and false summonses.
Questions for the commissioner
The committee has agreed to send 15 questions to the commissioner in relation to the scandal and in addition, asked her to outline her knowledge of any further mishandling of garda figures.
Her written responses are due back to the committee the day before the Sinn Féin motion of no confidence.
Yesterday, Tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald outlined plans for the independent root-and-branch review of the gardaí. She also told her Cabinet colleagues that the Policing Authority will carry out an investigation into the breath tests scandal.
It’s understood an independent expert, who could be named as early as this week, will head up the Garda review.
It’s believed Fianna Fáil were not consulted prior to the plans being brought to Cabinet yesterday.
One source said the lack of consultation with Fianna Fáil’s justice spokesperson Jim O’Callaghan prior to the meeting is a clear indication that the relationship between O’Callaghan and Fitzgerald has soured.
The Tánaiste is scheduled to meet with opposition representatives today.
YESTERDAY, DURING LEADERS’ Questions in the Dáil, Independents4Change TD Clare Daly raised claims about a 14-year-old she said suffers from narcolepsy, and said that he had been denied documents under discovery by the HSE.
She said that the HSE had previously indicated that it would voluntarily disclose documents, but then went to the High Court last week to “obstruct this boy and people like who are seeking documents under discovery”.
Taoiseach Enda Kenny replied that he was unaware of the details of the case but promised that he would look into it as the matter “deserves immediate analysis”.
Suffering
Clare Daly detailed the experience of the 14-year-old narcolepsy sufferer and the difficulties she said he had experience since being diagnosed with the disease.
“He can fall asleep without warning and has done so,” she said. “He has smashed his teeth and broken his bones.
The condition limits “every aspect of his daily life” and it will continue to do so for the rest of his life, the TD for Dublin North said.
This “avoidable catastrophe” was caused by the swine flu vaccination Pandemrix, she said.
This boy and 80 others like him were affected, according to Daly.
In 2014, a link between the vaccine and narcolepsywas confirmed in Ireland.
HSE
Daly said that, despite the HSE saying it would voluntarily disclose documents, it and “the State Claims Agency went into the High Court last week unnoticed and undocumented to obstruct this boy and people like him who are seeking documents under discovery”.
She wants to know why the HSE decided to purchase Pandemrix even after she said “it knew it was dangerous and untested”.
She asked the Taoiseach if the Minister for Health, in 2009, was made aware of the safety profile of this vaccine compared to others and why the “least safe vaccine” was chosen.
She also called on the Taoiseach to introduce a no-fault vaccine damage payment scheme.
“A serious matter”
Kenny said that this was a matter that deserved “immediate analysis” and he didn’t have answers for Daly at that moment, because he was not aware of the details of the case.
He said: “Deputy Daly said the situation was avoidable given the information that was available to the company. A court case is ongoing.”
The Taoiseach did say that a centre of excellence was in the process of being set up at St James’s Hospital, and that the programme for government included a commitment to examine supports for people harmed by vaccines.
He acknowledged that it was a serious matter and said he would work with Minister for Health Simon Harris to see that this case was followed up as soon as possible.
Daly added that the case was “one of the biggest public health scandals in recent years”.
She said knowledge on the dangers of these vaccines was known a decade ago, and that this case had been on the agenda as a priority in the Minister for Health’s first briefing a year ago.
She concluded by saying that the State Claims Agency would return to court on 23 May, and asked the Taoiseach to instruct it to bring forward the documentation to “assist people in their fight for justice”.
AN IT SERVICES company is set to announce that over 300 jobs will be created at its base in Dublin city.
Taoiseach Enda Kenny is expected to make the announcement at Version 1 this morning.
The jobs will be created over the next three years in the areas of systems integration, cloud and data analytics, and enterprise resource planning.
Version 1, founded in Dublin in 1996, also has offices in Cork and various locations in the UK, employing over 850 people.
The company is expected to make €100 million in revenue for the first time this year.
GARDA REFORM WAS the topic of conversation at cabinet this morning, and that was on the agenda for Leaders’ Questions today.
Opposition deputies also pushed the Taoiseach on the ongoing Bus Éireann strike, and the case of a vaccination that may have given some who received it debilitating diseases.

Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin up first.
He starts with the Bus Éireann dispute.
People are “frustrated, annoyed and angry” with the government, he says.
“If this was Dublin, it would have been sorted now” is what people are saying, according to Martin.

Bus Éireann is not getting its fair share from funding, the Fianna Fáil leader says.
The bottom line is that Bus Éireann gets a lower subsidy per passenger than Dublin Bus does, he adds.
“Why won’t the government make an intervention on the policy front that would facilitate the resolution of this dispute?” he asks.
“I condemn the wildcat strike,” Taoiseach Enda Kenny begins.
The Ministerhasintervened in respect of policy decisions, Kenny adds.
He also tells Martin that: “You say it’s possible to cross-subsidise it, but my information says different.”

The place to settle the issues is at the table, facilitated by the WRC.
“Minister Ross has been more than encouraging,” the Taoiseach says.
An anomaly has arisen in the subsidy paid to two semi-state companies, the Fianna Fáil leader responds.
Dublin Bus got 11 times more than Bus Éireann, he claims.
Martin says “if the government was serious about this, there are ways and means of contributing to solving this dispute”.
“There’s an obligation this gets solved quickly.”
The Taoiseach says that the workers won’t bear the brunt of this by themselves, once the unions agree a deal at the WRC.
“The government is expanding the public bus service in rural Ireland through expanded PSO funding,” he says.

“In terms of policy, these are matters the Minister has been very active on.”
Sinn Féin’s Mary Lou McDonald up next, and she wants to talk about An Garda Síochana.
She says there’s a “detached arrogance” at the top of garda management.
“People are left scratching their heads” as to why Nóirín O’Sullivan is still the Garda Commissioner, McDonald claims.
She accuses the government of refusing to act decisively.
No inquiry will be satisfactory while the commissioner remains in charge, she adds.
“Her position is untenable.”

“Are you okay that this may not be the end of the garda scandals?” she asks the Taoiseach.
This is all about trust, confidence, respect and pride, according to the Taoiseach.
“The government treats this with the utmost seriousness,” he says.
He says that Tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald briefed cabinet this morning.
The cases have been referred to the independent Policing Authority, he says.
The Tánaiste will work with opposition TDs to conduct this reform of An Garda Síochana, Kenny says.
“You will have involvement,” he tells McDonald.

He says he has received the final report from the Fennelly Commission.
It is extremely lengthy.
“I’m statutorily bound to give that to the Attorney General,” he says.
Its publication will come shortly.
“You are still wedded to the old way of doing things,” McDonald accuses Kenny.
She says Micheál Martin fears an election and that is why Fianna Fáil won’t take a stronger stance against the Garda Commissioner.
“The position of the Garda Commissioner is untenable. Sin é.”
Work is being done in exceptional circumstances in many places around the country, according to Kenny referring to An Garda Síochana.
“You focus on one person only. It’s a lot bigger than this,” Kenny says.
Clare Daly is next.
She says it’s a shame Kenny didn’t have such an appetite for change to the gardaí a few years ago.
But, she wants to talk about a young teen who suffers from narcolepsy.
“He wasn’t born with it. This was an avoidable catastrophe,” she says.
He received the vaccine for swine flu. The HSE distributed a “dangerous, untested” drug, Daly claims.
“Ireland gave GSK full indemnity” for this drug”, Daly says. She wants to know why this “unsafe” drug was distributed among the general public.

The Taoiseach thanks Daly for bringing the matter forward.
The Minister for Health has sanctioned the go-ahead for a sleep disorder centre at St James’s Hospital.
You make very strong claims here about Pandemrix, he says.
He says Daly’s claims deserve immediate analysis.
Daly replies that this is a “massive public health scandal”.
Health authorities were aware of the dangers around this drug, Daly says.
She says there are 80 people so far diagnosed with difficulties after being given this drug.
Rural independent TD Michael Collins is next.
He’s talking about the disabilities’ protest that took place last week.
He says there are many difficulties for parents of children with disabilities.
“There are a huge number of people in Cork and Kerry driving their children to disability day centres for four hours a day,” he says.

He wants transport services for disability organisation more synchronised, and more funding to be provided.
Kenny says that Minister for Disabilities Finian McGrath takes his role very seriously, and his department do great work.
“I suggest you talk directly to the Minister”, Kenny suggests.
McGrath has a pretty serious budget, he adds.
These services should be available already, Collins responds.
People with disabilities over the age of 18 are not entitled to this transport service, he says.
“We have situations where buses are travelling with just one or two people on them.”
Set out your problem, and set out your proposition, and tell it to the Minister, Kenny reiterates.

So, that’s a wrap for Leaders’ Questions.
The Taoiseach mainly faced queries on the Bus Éireann strike and the Garda Commissioner but there were little fireworks.

HOUSING MINISTER SIMON COVENEY has said he believes Taoiseach Enda Kenny will make his departure date known by the summer.
When asked about the Fine Gael leadership battle, the minister toldRTÉ’s Morning Irelandthat he trusts Enda Kenny’s judgement to choose the right time to step aside.
“I suspect it will happen before the summer,” said the minister.
“I am very comfortable with letting Enda Kenny use his judgment on that… the Taoiseach is the person in charge of Fine Gael and government. I’m trusting he will use his judgement to get the timing right on that.”
Social Protection Minister Leo Varadkar and Coveney – the two frontrunners in the leadership race (although other ministers such as Richard Bruton and Frances Fitzgerald are yet to formally make their intentions known) – are patiently waiting in the wings while Kenny bides his time.
There has been much speculation about when Kenny will step aside as Fine Gael leader and Taoiseach.
St Patrick’s Day visit has come and gone
Managing to stave off a motion of no confidence in his leadership among party members, the Taoiseach told his party he would make his intentions known following his return from his St Patrick’s Day trip to the White House.
However, while in New York he hinted to the media that there were a lot of issues he wanted to see through before he left the helm of the party – such as the formation of a government in Northern Ireland. That was a firm message to his possible successors that his departure date was being pushed out.
This was followed by Finance Minister Michael Noonan making comments that Kenny should stay on until the autumn. Noonan said he wants Kenny to stay on as Taoiseach past the initial Brexit negotiations until Ireland’s position is made clear.
However, there is really little appetite within the party for the Taoiseach to stay on until that late date.
Whatever date Kenny chooses, Coveney said he is “happy” to give the Taoiseach “the time and space” to make a decision.
But who is leading the pack?
According to the most recent poll published in the Irish Daily Mail today, support among Fine Gael voters is fairly tight.
If Varadkar is leader, the survey finds the party would take 60 seats in the next election – a significant jump of ten seats. Meanwhile, if Coveney was leader, the party would take 57 seats – up seven seats.
The survey finds that if there was an election today, with Kenny still in the driving seat, Fine Gael would take only 44 seats, a drop-off of six seats for the party.
Speaking on the radio this morning, Coveney said it is important that there is an “orderly transition” of the party leadership. He stated it is also important that the government continues to function during that time.

Although the leadership battle hasn’t officially launched, things have been going on in the background for some time now.
Just last week, Varadkar made his pitch in a newspaper article, where he outlined what tax policy he would pursue in the future.
So, how is Coveney’s campaign going?
Laughing it off when asked this question today, Coveney said, “there is no campaign up and running. I am focusing on a lot of work I have to do on water, housing and homelessness and a whole range of other things”.
“There will be a time when I am very focused on that,” he said, adding that he is getting on with the “serious business of being as good as I can be in government”.
Referencing the latest poll, he said: “There will be polls that will come and go.”
House prices
Coveney also hit back against calls for him to suspend the Government’s help-to-buy scheme, following claims it is fuelling the latest surge in house prices.
He said both the Central Bank and the Government spotted the same problem – that first-time buyers could not put a deposit together to buy a home.
Defending his scheme, the minister said people were being “locked into the private rental market” and builders were not building homes for that cohort of people as they knew they were not obtaining mortgages.
Coveney said the Government is not going to allow the same situation which happened during the boom to happen again, where first-time buyers were allowed borrow “ridiculous amounts of money”.
THE VAST MAJORITY of Irish people think Enda Kenny should step aside as Brexit Minister when he leaves office, according to a recent poll.
The Red C/ Sunday Business Post poll shows that 60% of those polled think that Kenny should relinquish his title as Brexit Minister once he resigns as Taoiseach.
Although Kenny hasn’t officially announced when he will leave, he’s expected to give a timeline for his departure soon – sometime after 29 April is one reported deadline.
That’s the date set for the European Council – a summit that will set the negotiating criteria for talks between the EU and UK.
Kenny has signaled that he wishes to stay on to ensure Brexit negotiations and talks in Northern Ireland progress smoothly – a move Simon Coveney, who’s a leading candidate for the Fine Gael leadership described as ‘unsurprising’.
The same poll also showed that People were split on whether there should be a general election when Enda Kenny steps down and there’s another Fine Gael leader and Taoiseach.
The poll also showed that the vast majority of people didn’t think the government had a clear plan to deal with Brexit (68%) and that 58% of people thought that a united Ireland was the best way to avoid a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland.
Updated 3.05pm
GARDA COMMISSIONER NÓIRÍN O’Sullivan has issued a statement relating to the recent revelations of non-existent breath tests recorded by An Garda Síochana.
This week senior gardaírevealed the baffling discoverythat almost one million roadside breath tests that never happened had been recorded on internal garda systems over the last five years.
It was alsorevealedthat 146,856 summonses to court were wrongly issued to drivers over the past 10 years.
O’Sullivan said that they were looking at a problem which goes back “more than a decade”, and confirmed that new processes and systems would be put in place to ensure that such discrepancies never happen again.
It wasn’t just about a systemic issue, she said, it was about ethics, supervision, measurement and, “most of all, it’s about trust”.
She added that, as An Garda Síochana embarks on a “journey of radical reform”, it is “inevitable that we will identify more examples of bad practice”.
This information, no matter how negative it is, will be fully disclosed to the public, O’Sullivan said.
Independent validation
In her statement, O’Sullivan indicated that she had written to the Policing Authority seeking further review of the breath test discrepancies.
She said that she asked the Authority to consider requesting the Garda Inspectorate to: examine the processes and methodology utilised to identify the nature and extent of the problems; review the control measures put in place designed to address the issues; examine if the current processes regarding roadside breath testing are in line with best practice.
The Policing Authority is an independent body that provides oversight to the provision of policing services in Ireland.
The Garda Inspectorate, meanwhile, is an independent statutory body with the brief to ensure the resources available to An Garda Síochana “are used to achieve and maintain the highest levels of efficiency and effectiveness in its operation and administration”.
In addition, O’Sullivan said she has directed Assistant Commissioner Michael O’Sullivan and a team to undertake a further detailed analysis of the remedial work done to date on the matter and provide a report to the Policing Authority within a month.
“We have taken corrective action,” the commissioner said. “We are asking that the corrective action be externally validated. That will reassure the public.
“A matter of grave disappointment”
O’Sullivan acknowledged that what they’ve found regarding the incorrect reporting of breath tests is “totally unacceptable”.
Garda management were of the opinion that this wasn’t a situation of “occasional systems failure” but a matter of “individual and collective ethical behaviour”.
She said: “It is a matter of grave disappointment that this has apparently been happening for so long, unchallenged.
She indicated that every measure would be taken to correct the problems and make sure they do not re-occur.
A help line will be set up for drivers affected by the incorrect court summonses by Monday 3 April, and a detailed report on the problems, when they were identified and what action would be taken is being provided to the Tánaiste and Policing Authority.
Political pressure
Taoiseach Enda Kenny said that recent revelations over garda breath tests and wrongful court summonses were “not acceptable”, and that he hopes that Garda Commissioner Nóirín O’Sullivan is “very clear” with her next statement on the matter.
Speaking at an EU summit in Rome today, Kenny said: “I would like the commissioner to be very clear in her statement that she makes later this evening. It’s not acceptable,”RTÉ News reported.
He added that it was “not for the government” to interfere in the running of the gardaí, as it was “an internal matter”.
In an interview withRTÉ Newsyesterday, Tánaiste and Minister for Justice Frances Fitzgerald called the scale of the error “appalling and staggering”.
“So it does raise issues around supervision and accountability in relation to this issue.”
Although Fitzgerald said that she had made her concerns clear to O’Sullivan, she also retained confidence in the commissioner to fulfil her role.
Speaking to Claire Byrne on RTÉ Radio 1 earlier this afternoon, Social Protection Minister Leo Varadkar said the latest revelations from the gardaí were “appalling”.
Asked whether he continued to have confidence in the Commissioner, he said that he did, and said he was keen to see the expected statement.

EUROPEAN UNION LEADERS renewed their vows at a special summit in Rome today, celebrating the bloc’s 60th anniversary with a commitment to a common future without Britain.
Meeting without British Prime Minister Theresa May, the other 27 member countries signed a declaration of unity on the Capitoline Hill where six founding states signed the Treaty of Rome on March 25, 1957.
With the EU facing crises including migration, a moribund economy, terrorism and populism, as well as Brexit, EU President Donald Tusk called for leadership to shore up the bloc.
“Prove today that you are the leaders of Europe, that you can care for this great legacy we inherited from the heroes of European integration 60 years ago,” Tusk said in a speech.
The Rome Declaration that the leaders, including Taoiseach Enda Kenny, signed proclaims that “Europe is our common future”, and sets out the path for the next decade in a rapidly changing world.

“It is it a bit of a tighter squeeze in the room today” than when the original six states signed up, joked Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni after welcoming the leaders to the Renaissance-era Palazzo dei Conservatori for a ceremony long on pomp and short on real politics.
“We have had 60 years of peace in Europe and we owe it to the courage of the founding fathers,” Gentiloni said, acknowledging that a string of crises had combined to bring the process of European integration to a standstill.
“When the iron curtain fell in 1989 we thought their dream had been realised but (recent crises) have shown us that history is anything but finished.

‘Shoulders of giants’
European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker also insisted the EU could ride out recent storms.
“Daunting as they are, the challenges we face today are in no way comparable to those faced by the founding fathers,” he said, recalling how the new Europe was built from the ashes of World War II.
“We are standing on the shoulders of giants,” Juncker said, voicing confidence that the EU would still be around to celebrate its 100th birthday.

The leaders had the words of Pope Francis to ponder, after the pontiff warned on the eve of the summit that the crisis-ridden bloc “risks dying” without a new vision.
The White House meanwhile congratulated the EU overnight on its 60th birthday, in a notable shift in tone for President Donald Trump’s administration, whose deep scepticism about the bloc has alarmed Brussels.
“Our two continents share the same values and, above all, the same commitment to promote peace and prosperity through freedom, democracy, and the rule of law,” the White House said in a statement.
Security was tight with snipers on rooftops, drones in the skies and 3,000 police officers on the streets following an attack this week in London claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group.
May’s absence, four days before she launches the two-year Brexit process, and a row over the wording of the Rome declaration have underscored the challenges the EU faces.

Protests planned
Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo only agreed to sign the declaration at the last minute, after bitterly opposing a reference to a “multi-speed” Europe favoured by powerhouse states France and Germany.

Poland, central Europe’s largest economy, is concerned that as one of nine of the EU’s current 28 members outside the eurozone, it could be left behind should countries sharing the single currency push ahead with integration.
The aim of the summit was to channel the spirit of the Treaty of Rome that Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands and West Germany signed six decades ago to create the European Economic Community (EEC).
The treaty was signed in the Horatii and Curiatii hall of the Palazzo dei Conservatori, one of the Renaissance palaces that line the Michelangelo-designed Capitoline Square, and the political and religious heart of the Roman Empire in ancient times.

Police in the Eternal City were on alert not only for attackers in the wake of the British parliament attack on Wednesday, but also violent anti-Europe demonstrators.
Around 30,000 protesters are expected to take part in four separate marches – both pro- and anti-Europe – throughout the day.

FORMER US PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has paid a visit to Government Buildings.
Clinton, in Ireland for yesterday’s funeral of Martin McGuinness, met with Enda Kenny in his office, the Government Information Service confirmed.
During his speech at the funeral in Derry, Clinton paid tribute to Kenny for his speech in Washington last week.
He said:
The Taoiseach’s speech about the value of immigration has been viewed tens of millions of times since last Thursday.
Clinton was also spotted shopping in Dublin’s city centre.

BILL CLINTON DREW applause from the congregation at the funeral of Martin McGuinness today as he paid tribute to Enda Kenny for his White House speech last week, in the presence of Donald Trump.

While there was some critical Irish coverage of Kenny’s performance in Washington initially, speeches he gave after Friday’s newspapers went to print picked up traction in following days.
The New York Times referred to a “lecture” for President Trump on immigration, in its coverage of the Fine Gael leader’s US visit.
A clip of a speech at the Shamrock Ceremony, where Kenny refers to St Patrick as the patron saint of immigrants, posted online by Channel 4 Newswent viral on Friday.
“Ireland came to America, because deprived of liberty, opportunity, safety and even food itself, we believed,” he told the crowd.
Updated 10pm
A SINN FÉIN MEP has asked the government to take an international legal challenge against the Egyptian government for breaching the human rights of Irish citizen, Ibrahim Halawa.
Speaking after the 20th postponement of the man’s trial, Lynn Boylan said:
“It is clear from the most recent postponement that President Sisi is not taking the calls of the Irish Government to release Ibrahim seriously, despite having the means to do so through both the youth amnesty and the presidential decree.
The Irish national has been held without trial since being arrested at a protest in Cairo in August 2013.
Boylan said that during the last 3 and half years, the court has only heard evidence on two occasions from 15 of the 100 witnesses.
“At this rate, it will take years for the trial to conclude, it is time that the Irish government took a hard line and defended this young man’s human rights.”
Speaking today, Taoiseach Enda Kenny said that he was “disturbed” by the reports emerging about Halawa’s deteriorating health.
He said: “I read a report where he was reported to be confined to a wheelchair… I am disturbed by this, and we want to have verified from an Irish medical point of view what is the condition of Ibrahim Halawa.”
The government is believed to be in the process of sending an independent medical expert to assess Halawa’s health at the Egyptian prison.
Speaking from Belfast where he is engaged in political Talks, Minister Flanagan said that the lack of clarity around Halawa’s health remained a serious concern. He said:
“I am disappointed and frustrated by a further adjournment in the court case in which Ibrahim Halawa is a defendant.
“Ibrahim has now spent more than thirteen hundred days and nights in an Egyptian prison cell without having been convicted of any crime. This is a source of great concern to the Irish government.”
He urged Halawa not to pursue a hunger strike, or any other actions that would be detrimental to his health.

On Sunday, Sinn Féin MEP Lynn Boylan toldRTÉ’s The Week in Politicsthat Halawa’s spirit is finally broken” and she is fearful he may not survive until his next scheduled trial date.
“His condition has deteriorated dramatically in the last number of weeks,” she said.
“I know Ibrahim has embarked on hunger strikes on and off over the period of his detention, but I think following the parliamentary delegation in January and then the further postponement of his trial, I think his spirit is finally broken so he’s now embarked on this hunger strike. He’s being kept alive by glucose injections and he’s in a wheelchair.
After visiting Ibrahim in the Cairo jail in which he has been detained for almost four years without trial, Boylan described the harsh conditionsthat have led to his ill health.
It has been indicated that his trial has been again been rescheduled, this time for 5 April.
ENDA KENNY HAS told Fine Gael TDs that he plans to be Taoiseach until at least the end of April.
Speaking to members of the parliamentary party today, Kenny said that he was focused on two key issues – Brexit and the Northern Executive.
He said Brexit was a political challenge and he would address his own future after the European Council on 29 April. That summit will set the negotiating criteria for talks between the EU and UK.
Kenny reiterated his stance that there would be no return to the border of the past. He said he would not be allowing any period of uncertainty and there would be an orderly transition in respect of the leadership.
Kenny’s statements to the party are thought to gone down well, according to sources.
“He outlined his plans and there seemed to be general acceptance, begrudging maybe, but silence from the rebels,” said one.
A poll released yesterday showed Kenny has more supportthan the two leading pretenders to his crown – Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney – to handle Ireland’s Brexit negotiations.

MINISTER SIMON COVENEY has published the options available if Ireland is to extend the right to vote in presidential elections to citizens living abroad.
Earlier this month, Taoiseach Enda Kenny confirmed that a referendum would be held on the issue.
The available options include extending the vote to (note: not all will appear on the ballot paper):
When the government has decided on the preferred option, a constitution amendment bill will be drafted and examined in the Dáil and the Seanad.
When the bill is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas it will be put before the people in a referendum.
A date for the referendum will be decided by the government in due course. It’s unlikely any changes would be in place prior to the 2018 presidential election, rather the 2025 vote.
ENDA KENNY’S DECISION to invite US President Donald Trump to Ireland is supported by a majority of Irish people.
That’s according to a new Claire Byrne Live/Amárach Research poll, released tonight. The Claire Byrne Live /Amárach Research Panel consists of over 1,000 Irish adults, all aged 18+.
Kenny last week invited Trump to Ireland after meeting him in Washington DC.
“We had a good, friendly and constructive engagement,” Kenny told reporters in the White House lawn after the photocall.
Trump had told reporters:
“I really love Ireland, I’ll be there absolutely.”
While some, including Green Party TD Eamon Ryan, want the invitation revoked or the visit protested, most Irish people support the invitation.
The poll results were:
Was Taoiseach Enda Kenny right to have invited President Donald Trump to visit Ireland?
Yes – 63%No – 26%Don’t know – 11%
In a further boost to Kenny, another question showed that he had the most support of Irish people to lead Brexit negotiations.
That poll’s results were:
Who, of the following, do you have most confidence in to work for Ireland’s interest during the Brexit negotiations?
Enda Kenny – 24%Simon Coveney – 14%Leo Varadkar – 20%Don’t know – 42
Speaking in New York after marching in the city’s St Patrick’s Day parade, Kenny said that his immediate priority is dealing with political instability in Northern Ireland and the uncertainty Brexit would create for Ireland.
Updated 7.03pm
FINANCE MINISTER MICHAEL Noonan has said that he thinks Enda Kenny should stay on as Taoiseach until at least the summer.
Noonan wants Kenny to stay on as Taoiseach past the initial Brexit negotiations until Ireland’s position is made clear.
“We saw this week in the United States an example of how good Enda Kenny is in international negotiations. His speech on immigration has been lauded internationally, and to be able to make such a strong speech in the company of President Trump when we know his position on immigration shows how diplomatic the Taoiseach can be,” Noonan toldRTÉ’s Six One news.
So certainly for the primary principles of the negotiations which won’t conclude until end of April/early May, the Taoiseach should be in position. But it’s my own opinion that he should stay on until the second phase as well, when the details of Ireland’s negotiation position have been established and have been signed off on, and that’s the end of May/early June.
Meanwhile, Housing Minister Simon Coveney has says his is feeling “relaxed” about Enda Kenny staying on as Taoiseach.
One of the two top contenders for the Fine Gael leadership toldDrivetimethis evening that he wasn’t shocked by Kenny’s comments that he was staying on.
Coveney and Kenny at Fine Gael's think-in.Eamonn Farrell / RollingNews.ieEamonn Farrell / RollingNews.ie / RollingNews.ie
“I think anyone who knows the Taoiseach, anyone who is involved in Fine Gael’s discussions in recent weeks, is expecting the Taoiseach to attend the first leader’s meeting after Article 50 is triggered, and that is what he’s signaled his intent to do now.
“There’s no surprise there.”
Speaking in New York after marching in the city’s St Patrick’s Day parade, Kenny said that his immediate priority is dealing with political instability in Northern Ireland and the uncertainty Brexit would create for Ireland.
“What I did say to my own party was I would deal with this matter effectively and conclusively, and that is my intention, but I think these are priorities that take precedence over everything else,” he said.
Sam Boal / RollingNews.ieSam Boal / RollingNews.ie / RollingNews.ie
Coveney denied this evening that this was a turn around from Kenny’s previous comments around his departure and signalled a prolonged stay for the leader.
“The idea that An Taoiseach would be taking a personal interest in ensuring that the Assembly gets back up and running in Northern Ireland in the context of Brexit and many other things, that we need that Assembly up and running isn’t a surprise either.”
Coveney said that he trusts the Taoiseach to put in place a timeline for departure in the next two weeks.
He admitted that there was a small minority of members who wanted the leadership challenge to be brought forward, but he said that it was “very unlikely” someone might put forward a motion of no confidence in the Taoiseach, as they’d “get no support”.
During his St Patrick’s Day visit to the US, a previous draft version of Enda Kenny’s speech was circulated to the media by accident, which included a line stating that this would be his last visit to the US as Taoiseach.
But that line was removed from the final version – causing speculation about when exactly Enda Kenny plans to resign as the head of government and leader of Fine Gael.
With reporting from Christina Finn and Rónán Duffy
THE TENTATIVE QUESTION of Taoiseach Enda Kenny’s future as Fine Gael leader will be top of the media agenda following his return from the US.
It was expected that the much anticipated announcement at Fine Gael parliamentary party in February was the ideal opportunity to clarify his position. He chose however to instead bide some time by stating he would conclusively deal with his future as party leader after St Patrick’s Day.
Although the story has somewhat waned in recent weeks, it has not dampened speculation nor softened calls for a change of leadership. Some in the party may have been surprised by his fighting spirit, while others would have expected nothing less from a leader who has thwarted many a political coup.
It has also been reported of late that he could be dramatically appointed as the president of the European Council in early May, a role he was mooted for in the past.
Leadership contest in full swing
Despite such stalling tactics or new role speculations, there is little doubt that the official leadership contest between the main contenders, Minister Simon Coveney and Minister Leo Varadkar is in full swing, albeit in a more covert manner behind closed party doors.
One can assume both are demonstrating the necessary level of guile and charm to influence their party colleagues in their pursuit for the top prize.
In tandem, political commentators and the general public alike will muse over Kenny’s leadership position in the coming week. In contemplation for a likely stepping down, many will begin the ranking of his perceived or actual successes and failures throughout his time at the top.
Much conjecture of this type will depend largely on one’s political leaning or personal feelings towards the man himself as leadership with its inherent characteristics are subjective in their nature. This can at times place unrealistic expectations on a leader and hastily circumvent their reign.
Defining ‘leadership’
While leadership can prove difficult to define, the term embodies well recognised attributes. For instance, a leader is expected to lead by example, inspire others to action, understand the people and their needs, demonstrate integrity and resolve in equal measure, be diplomatic and charming, whilst being strategic and measured and so on.
Leadership and its requirements can also vary greatly between different professions and disciplines, from sport to politics or from the corporate to voluntary sector.
One common underlying theme that binds most of those in positions of leadership, is that once weakness or vulnerability is identified, or credibility and trust is lost, such positions of power often become untenable.
Modern leaders it’s fair to say are under far more scrutiny than their predecessors, particularly those in political power. The constant introspection of every soundbite or political manoeuvre through both traditional and social media platforms leaves little space for error or ill judgement.
Furthermore, with the growth of so called “fake news” in today’s media, political leaders are susceptible to targeted reputational damage through such unscrupulous propaganda campaigns.
Enda Kenny’s handling of whistleblower crisis
In the case of Taoiseach Enda Kenny however, his expected leadership downfall will be largely attributed to his own misguided handling of the whistleblower crisis last month, to which some contributory blame may also lay with his closest advisors.
One will recall that his well-publicised “mea culpa” contritely delivered in the Dáil in February, centred on his inaccurate relaying of information during an interview with RTÉ radio about a past meeting with Minister for Children Katherine Zappone before her meeting Sergeant Maurice McCabe.
Such admissions signalled the green light for this current leadership challenge.
For such a seasoned politician, it must be difficult for him and his team to comprehend the calamity of such erroneous actions, which were quite innocuous in the grander scheme of things. Their potent execution however, has ultimately compromised his leadership tenure.
Given the speed the story was developing at the time of the radio interview coupled with the increasing pressure being placed on both Garda Commissioner Nóirín O’Sullivan and Minister for Justice Frances Fitzgerald, it now appears particularly nonsensical as to why he took such a risky course of action in communicating such untruths to the media, ones that were easily discredited by Zappone herself.
With time, every leader makes mistakes
There is little doubt that An Taoiseach has demonstrated significant levels of leadership throughout his time in office. He could not have become leader of his party in the first instance nor subsequently his country for two unprecedented consecutive terms for Fine Gael, if he didn’t possess certain undeniable leadership qualities as were then valued.
With the passage of time, however, it’s inevitable a leader will make mistakes and in doing so, devalue their own reputational currency amongst their supporters and create the appropriate catalytic conditions for opportunistic incumbents.
What’s clear from these type of leadership debacles both past and present, is that any style of leadership, from democratic to dictatorial and everything in between, requires continued challenge and scrutiny whether it be on the field of play, in the corporate boardroom or Dáil chambers.
To do otherwise would seriously undermine the very concept of positive and powerful leadership and instead create a forum for societal inertia.

ENDA KENNY WILL today land back on Irish soil after visiting America for the traditional St Patrick’s Day exchange of pleasantries with the US president.
Much of the reaction to Kenny’s performance while in Washington, including giving a speech whichappeared to pointedly address Donald Trump’s immigration policies,has been positive.
However, in New York last night the Taoiseach also appeared to row back on a commitment to put a timeline on his departure as both leader of Ireland and Fine Gael, saying he will not be vacating his position until uncertainty over the effect of Brexit on the Northis cleared up.
“What I did say to my own party was I would deal with this matter (his departure) effectively and conclusively, and that is my intention, but I think these are priorities that take precedence over everything else,” the Taoiseach said.
But what do you think? Is Kenny right that Brexit and political chaos in the North take precedence? Or should he stick to what he said he would do?
We’re asking:Do you think Enda Kenny has far too much on his plate to be vacating his position?Poll Results:No, it's time for him to go(9061)Yes, these matters need to be addressed(6862)I'm not sure(833)Yes, these matters need to be addressedNo, it's time for him to goI'm not sureVote
“TAOISEACH THAT’S MY new friend, a great guy…and Fiola (sic), you’re something special, too.”
In his own inimitable, rambling style, and apparently untroubled by Enda Kenny’s remark in the Dáil last year about then candidate Trump’s racist comments, the President of the United States welcomed his guests from Ireland to the White House.
Although some of the television images would suggest that President Trump wasn’t particularly happy while sitting for pictures with the Taoiseach, he probably should have seen it as a welcome respite from what was a long week for him and his administration.
Likewise, the Taoiseach had a topsy-turvy week while he was in America. Let’s retrace each of their footsteps prior to Thursday’s annual shamrock shindig.
Several days ago, President Trump’s tax return from 2005 somehow came into the possession of a journalist who passed it on to the left-wing talk show host Rachel Maddow. She promptly revealed the contents on air.
It turned out to be a damp squib. Trump paid $38 million to the government on earnings of approximately $150 million.
This rate of around 25%, while still fairly low, was not as obscenely minuscule as some observers anticipated and there is credible speculation that the administration itself leaked the return.
If this was a minor hiccup, the decisions of federal courts in Hawaii and Maryland to strike down the second so-called “Trump Ban” on immigrants from six predominantly Muslim countries was a major setback.

The second ban was purportedly “constitution proofed” after the first was similarly rejected in the courts. The outcome has pleased his opponents, but the judges have arguably overreached.
Broad authority is customarily conferred by the judiciary on the president on the issue of immigration. Unambiguous statutory language allows the president to suspend entry of foreigners whenever he decides “it would be detrimental to the interests” of the US; and a Supreme Court precedent states that courts may not look past a neutrally worded (as the second one is) ban to ascertain its intent (as the Hawaii and Maryland judges have).
Nonetheless, President Trump made a colossal blunder in attacking the judiciary for halting the first ban and these further losses may be seen, at one level, as push back.
He has encountered serious difficulty in fulfilling his campaign pledge to abolish “Obamacare.”
The bill favoured by many conservatives and currently under consideration would disproportionately impact a lot of poor and working class people who voted for the president. Republican senators in states like West Virginia and Ohio, where many of these disadvantaged voters live, have balked at supporting it.
It seems to be dawning on the president that health care is an extremely complex matter and that the politics of it are even more vexing, especially for someone who only prevailed because he garnered the backing of an unusually economically diverse coalition of Americans.
President Trump is also learning that getting legislation through the two houses of Congress is an altogether different task to signing executive orders.

Meanwhile, shortly after arriving on US soil, the Taoiseach announced that a referendum will soon be held on extending the right to vote in presidential elections to Irish citizens who reside outside the country.
This is not an unusual or radical proposition – the vast majority of western democracies, unlike Ireland, do not disenfranchise their citizens living abroad – but it provoked an extraordinary reaction back here.

Visceral opposition revolves either around the fear that the electorate at home will be “swamped” by those who have never been here, yet could access citizenship though an Irish born grandparent, or the “no representation without taxation” mantra.
Others assert that this is just not a priority and simply a tactic to divert attention either from more pressing substantive issues or from the Taoiseach’s desire to cling to office for as long as possible.
Either way, extrapolating from the heated debates in a variety of forums this week, emigrant voting rights are far more contentious than many inside and outside of Government circles had previously thought.
Enda Kenny may wish he hadn’t mooted holding this referendum while speaking to the media in Philadelphia. He subsequently went to Boston and received what the Irish left regarded as a rebuke from the city’s mayor, Martin Walsh, a son of Connemara emigrants.
At a press conference, Mayor Walsh, who leads a city that is now more diverse than ever and is campaigning for re-election to a second term against an African-American city councillor, indicated that he would not support any effort to legalise solely the Irish undocumented.
Instead of contextualising the Irish American mayor’s politically necessary stance, commentators have run with the “see, nothing can or should be done for the Irish” line.
The fact, however, is that Enda Kenny is the prime minister of Ireland, not the mayor of Boston, and has a moral duty to advocate for the undocumented (or illegal) Irish, a substantial number of whom left this country due to a dearth of opportunity and who have contributed greatly to the economy and societal fabric of a country where they are forced to live in the shadows.
And the Taoiseach can tell their story at the same time as he can be a unique, white voice in a larger, darker chorus urging immigration reform for all without legal status in the US.
Indeed, returning to the White House, the Taoiseach did follow both tracks: he talked about 50,000 of his own people who can’t return home for momentous occasions, both joyous and sad, and he spoke of their being a small part of a much bigger tapestry of immigrants in a country built by immigrants, all of whom want to play their part in “making America great again.”

It was powerful stuff, and the Taoiseach did very well in diplomatically tricky circumstances in Washington, DC.
The opposition to and scrutiny of his visit to see an American president so widely abhorred at home was and is relentless, even though it was imperative that he go. By any objective measure, he acquitted himself and the Irish people honourably; there was no “Love Actually moment,” but he was far from supine.
Already, usually sensible politicians like Brendan Howlin and Eamon Ryan, joined by some of their eternally unreasonable colleagues, such as Ruth Coppinger and Richard Boyd Barrett, have attacked the Taoiseach for his “failures” in America and his invitation to Donald Trump to visit Ireland.
Yet they will surely relish the chance to protest him at every turn when and if he does come here as president.
In light both of myriad economic and other realities and of the long-term friendship between the two countries, Enda Kenny had no other choice than to invite the man who had him as a guest of honour in the White House.
If he hadn’t done so, it would have been a betrayal of the virtue of hospitality that the Irish are so well-known for around the world and which underpins the unparalleled access they enjoy to the most powerful men and women in the world every year at this time – seriously cringe inducing moments notwithstanding.

ENDA KENNY’S SPEECH last night at the shamrock ceremony received international focus as he spoke at length about Irish immigration.
The Taoiseach used the opportunity speak at length about the contribution of the Irish community in the United States, leading tothe New York Timescalling it a “lecture” for President Trump on immigration.
A clip of the speech, where Kenny refers to St Patrick as the patron saint of immigrants, posted online by Channel 4 Newshas gone viral.
“Ireland came to America, because deprived of liberty, opportunity, safety and even food itself, we believed,” he told the crowd.
Watch the clip above for the Taoiseach’s speech in full.
YESTERDAY WAS A big day for Enda Kenny on his St Patrick’s Day visit to the United States, meeting with Trump in the Oval Office and holding the traditional Shamrock ceremony.
This annual ceremony dates back to 1952, and has taken place in some form every year since.
But aside from this main gift, the Taoiseach also has a few other goodies for the White House.
Here’s what he gave this year:

This year’s bowl was made by Criostal na Rinne, based in the Waterford Gaeltacht An Rinn, and inspired by artwork from the Book of Kells.
The shamrock is said to be destroyed by the Secret Service due to safety fears, as perishable goods given to a US president are viewed with suspicion.

As well as the Shamrock Bowl, Kenny gave Trump a set of cufflinks from Dublin-based goldsmith and jeweller Declan Killen.
He was also presented with a Bord Bia hamper containing a range of Irish food, similar to what has been gifted to Obama in recent years. Again, it would be up to the Secret Service as to whether this would be kept or destroyed.

Vice President Mike Pence, who already received a framed family tree and the original roll book from the Sligo school where his grandfather was enrolled in 1912, was given another pressie – a framed copy of the census of Ireland 1911, including details of Vice President Pence’s Grandfather Richard Cawley and his Great Grandmother Ellen Cawley.
IRISH INTEREST IN the traditional Washington St Patrick’s Day celebrations has surged this year, in the wake of Trump’s shock win last November.
Almost as soon as the controversial businessman clinched victory, attention turned to the annual White House visit – with some arguing Enda Kenny should decline the invitation this year.
The Taoiseach was asked repeatedly in the run up to the visit whether he intended to raise subjects like the travel ban affecting Muslim-majority countries like Sudan and Yemen.
There was also speculation over whether Kenny’s comments last year that Trump had used “racist and dangerous” language on the campaign would come up, when the two men met.
Those remarks, made in the Dáil last May, were put under a renewed focus this week when former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the Taoiseach should apologise to Trump. As a result, Kenny was asked to respond to Farage’s remarks during a US media op.
That angle, and Kenny’s lobbying effort on behalf of the Irish undocumented, made the news in the US in the last 24 hours.
Here’s how all the White House and Washington events were covered by American media outlets – starting with the New York Times:

The paper’s Mark Landler wrotethat Trump ”found himself in a roomful of kelly-green-clad lawmakers in the Capitol for the Friends of Ireland luncheon, being lectured by Enda Kenny, the Irish prime minister, or taoiseach (pronounced THEE-shakh), about the virtues of America’s immigrant legacy and the contributions that immigrants had made to the country.”
He added:
Trump’s now almost infamous recitation of his beloved Irish ‘proverb’ also merited a mention from America’s paper of record:
The New York Times also carried an op-ed from Irish Times columnist Fintan O’Toole (published in advance of the White House visit yesterday) in which he wrote that Kenny needed to stand up for all US immigrants, not just the Irish.
‘Musician boycott’
Kenny made the front page of the Wall Street Journal,while the Washington Postincluded a photo of Trump speaking in front of Irish and American flags on its front page, mentioning Kenny and his visit in the caption.
Inside the paper, there was coverage of three Irish musicians who boycotted the traditional celebration of Irish-US relations.
According to journalist Mary Jordan:
The paper’s online edition made mention of Irish reaction to the annual plámás-fest – including the Twitter reaction to Mike Pence’s use of the phrase “top of the morning”, and to Trump’s ‘proverb’.

Elsewhere, CNN ran a wider piecelooking at the situation of the Irish undocumented in America:
Fox News carried an article from the Associated Press on its websitewith the headline:‘Ireland’s leader pushes Trump on illegal Irish immigrants’
The first four paragraphs:
How the Irish Independent and Irish Times covered the visit.
On balance, Kenny’s message about the position of the Irish in America got a much more positive response from liberal-leaning US outlets like the NYT and non-Irish outlets like Channel 4 News than it did in our own media.
Taoisigh regularly raise the issue of the Irish undocumented on White House visits. This year, however, it’s a subject that could hardly be more apposite:

THE TAOISEACH WAS confronted with comments he had apparently made about Donald Trump some months ago, while facing questions from Irish journalists during his St Patrick’s Week visit to Washington DC, last night.
Earlier in the day former UKIP leader Nigel Farage told RTE Radio One Enda Kenny should apologise to Donald Trump for calling him “racist”.
Kenny denied this last night, claiming:
Let’s have a look at that.
(Send your FactCheck requests tofactcheck@thejournal.ie, tweet@TJ_FactCheck, or send us a DM).
Claim:Enda Kenny did not call Donald Trump “racist”
Many politicians and commentators have accused the Taoiseach of calling Trump “racist”, since his comments last May.
On Wednesday, the issue came to prominence once again after Nigel Faragetold Seán O’Rourkethe Taoiseach should apologise to Trump for calling him “racist”.
Later on, the Taoiseach’s past remarks were put to him at a press conference in Washington DC, andKenny told reporters, including TheJournal.ie’s Christina Finn:
Kenny was pressed by one journalist who asked “But if someone’s language is racist, are they not racist?”
The Taoiseach insisted:
You can watch a short video including all the relevant comments, below, but for now, let’s examine what Enda Kenny said in the first place.
In the Dáil on 31 May 2016, the Taoiseach faced questions from TDs about his planned official engagements. In the course of that, Solidarity-PBP TD Richard Boyd Barrett asked:
Later, Kenny replied:
It’s unclear what comments in particular the Taoiseach was referring to, or whether he had specific comments in mind. We asked the Taoiseach’s press office for clarification on this, but we did not receive a response.
In any event, it’s quite clear that Kenny referred to Trump’scomments, and not Trump himself, as racist and dangerous.
PA Wire / PA ImagesPA Wire / PA Images / PA Images
It could be argued that a person who makes a racist comment, or racist comments, is by definition racist as a person, and that by calling Trump’s comments racist, Enda Kenny was by definition calling Trump himself racist.
However, this is a subjective interpretation, and even at that, it’s not entirely convincing.
A person could, for example, make a racist comment in a subversive or ironic way. It would be difficult to maintain that this person is by definition racist.
Equally, a person could make racially bigoted remarks, but later entirely abandon the views that gave rise to those comments. It would also be difficult to maintain that this person is racist, simply by virtue of having made racist comments.
This is not to make any claim about the nature of President Trump’s views, policies or past comments.
It is simply to point out that describing a person’scommentsin one way does not mean that you are, in the mere act of describing their comments, by definition or logical necessity also describing thatpersonin the same way.
Obviously, one very often follows the other. But not necessarily or by definition.
Even if we are to leave that aside, we are left with the wording of Enda Kenny’s statement last May, when he called Trump’s comments, but not Trump himself, “racist and dangerous”.
We find the Taoiseach’s claim – that he never called Trump racist –Mostly TRUE.

TAOISEACH ENDA KENNY has met with US President Donald Trump in the Oval Office in the White House.
As the pair shook hands and posed for photographs following a private meeting, Trump confirmed to reporters that he intends to visit Ireland.
“I really love Ireland, I’ll be there absolutely,” Trump said in response to a question.
Kenny later confirmed that Trump agreed to come to Ireland after he extended an invite to the US President.
“We had a good, friendly and constructive engagement,” Kenny told reporters in the White House lawn after the photocall.

“The president also referred to hospitality and is very well acquainted with the golf courses of Ireland.”
During the Oval Office photocall, a number of other reporters then attempted to ask questions of the pair but a White House staffer attempted to end the interaction by repeating the phrase: “Thank you press”.
One Irish reporter then asked whether Kenny’s previous comments about Trump’s language being “racist and dangerous” was raised during their meeting.
There was no response to the query.

Briefing reporters about their meeting, Kenny said the pair discussed a range of issues including Brexit, the Irish economy and immigration.
“The president asked a number of questions about what the hard border meant in the past and I pointed out to him about customs posts and the sectarian violence that came with it,” Kenny said.
“I also spoke to him about the difficulties Brexit would have for Ireland and for Northern Ireland and I pointed out the economic indicators that show we’d be the most adversely affected.”

“I also spoke to him about immigration, and it’s important to make particular note of this here, of the fact that the president is interested in this and we had a very beneficial, constructive discussion about this,” Kenny said.
Kenny also said that he told Trump that Ireland would always be a “friend of America”.
At another gathering following the meeting, Trump then recited what he said was a proverb.
“As we stand together with our Irish friends, I’m reminded of that proverb and this is one I like, this is a good one, this is one I’ve heard for many years and I love it,” he said.
“We know that, politically speaking we know that,” Trump added.

Trump told the East Room of the White House that America is “an always loyal friend” to Ireland.
The US president said the Irish people have enriched America in inexplicable ways and they always will.
Referring to Ireland as America’s “faithful partner” and “loyal friend” he said the US “will always be there for you”.

Christina Finn reporting from the White House
TAOISEACH ENDA KENNY will visit the White House today to present the traditional bowl of shamrock to US President Donald Trump.
Trump’s revised travel ban – which Kenny had been asked if he would raise with the president – was due to come into effect today. But last nightsaw the ban being haltedby a federal court in Hawaii over fears it would cause “irreparable injury” if it went ahead.
The US President signed a revised executive order last week banning entry visas from six Muslim-majority countries: Libya, Iran, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.
Last week,TheJournal.ieasked Kenny if he would raise it as a matter of concern when he met the president. He replied:
Ever since the Taoiseach announced that he would be continuing with tradition and travelling to the White House this year, there have been calls for him to cancel his trip.
However, a spokesperson for the Taoiseach said the meeting will give Kenny the chance to “outline, in person, his Government’s views on a range of issues, including business and economic ties, immigration and other matters of common interest”.
The statement continued to say the Taoiseach will “continue to act in the interests of Irish people and to that end he will raise these matters again this year”.
Last night, Kenny wasasked again about his denials around calling POTUS a racist. Once again, he said that his comment “was in respect of his language”.
Atlast night’s Irish Funds Gala, Vice-President of the US, Mike Pence, spoke about his Irish heritage.
Also at the event, Senator George Mitchell spoke about Ireland and immigration to the USA.
He said there must be “realistic limits” on immigration, but policies must be developed to help the US live up to its principles as a just, open and welcoming society.
Kenny’s visit today has been criticised in some quarters. Labour leader Brendan Howlin has said that “the only thing a visit by the Taoiseach to the White House could achieve would be to present Ireland as a supine supporter for Donald Trump”.
Solidarity-PBP TD Richard Boyd Barrett said the travel ban for citizens of Muslim countries is “pure unadulterated racism” and must be condemned.
Meanwhile, former Governor Martin O’Malley will deliver a petition of 39,000 signatures to Enda Kenny in Washington DC today, ahead of Kenny’s White House visit.
The petition,titled ‘Shamrock for Trump: Not in my name’, calls on Kenny to be aware that “if he does decide to travel to meet President Trump on St Patrick’s Day, that he is not travelling in my name”.
Irish-US relations
Kenny’s morning today will begin with an early breakfast at the residence of Vice-President Mike Pence. He will then attend a bilateral meeting with President Trump and events hosted by Vice-President Pence and House Speaker Paul Ryan.
It’s understood the Taoiseach will use each of these opportunities to emphasise the strength of Irish-US relations and Ireland’s Brexit priorities. The Taoiseach is expected to again advocate for immigration reform to assist the many thousands of undocumented Irish in the US.
Kenny will also highlight Ireland’s commitment to EU membership, “emphasising the importance of the EU’s core values of human dignity, freedom, democracy and equality”.
The Taoiseach travels to New York tomorrow where he will participate in the St. Patrick’s Day parade.
He will then speak at ‘Ireland Day,’ a major event to promote Ireland, hosted by Michael Bloomberg in Bloomberg Headquarters.
He will also meet with Enterprise Ireland and IDA client companies, community and business representatives and attend the Tourism Ireland Greening of One World Trade Center before departing for Ireland later that evening.

TAOISEACH ENDA KENNY cannot escape the tough questions – even in Washington DC.
Following a lunch event today, he was asked about racism, gay marriage and – of course – his leadership of Fine Gael.
His answers on all of the former were as murky as those on the latter have been this side of the Atlantic in recent weeks.
“I did not refer to the person, the now President, as being racist. My comment was in respect of his language,” he said confidently on the first.
Will that be enough, Mr Farage?
And will he raise the idea of same-sex marriages with the conservative Vice President, the guest of honour for much of these festivities? Well, he may. Or, he may not. After all, Mike Pence has been particular vocal about LGBT rights. That is, he opposes many of them.
And so to the question Leo and Simon want us to ask.What of his leadership?That’s Enda’s prerogative too. He’s most certainly not going to describe this as his last Statesidehurrah as Taoiseach just yet.

An apology to Trump
This evening’s racism conundrum comes after Nigel Farage’s demand for an apology from the Taoiseach.
The former UKIP man took to Irish airwaves this morning to make clear he wanted Kenny to ensure the first thing said to Donald Trump tomorrow is ‘I’m sorry’ for that whole ‘racist’ furore.
Newstalk’s Chris Donoghue was wondering what the Fine Gael leader was going to do with the request.
The Taoiseach had nothing further to add on, most likely thinking ‘that was that’.
Since the US election last November, Kenny has consistently denied ever calling POTUS a racist, claiming he was merely describing Trump The Candidate’s use of the English language racist.
Last May, during the campaign (a time when the idea of a Trump White House hadn’t gone mainstream), he told the Dáil remarks made by Trump The Candidate were both “racist and dangerous”.
His exact words, in fact, were:

Those comments were dropped following questions about his government’s intentions from the Opposition benches. In the absence of Micheál Martin and Richard Boyd Barrett today, Donoghue picked up the slack.
So, after a whirlwind event in the United States Institute of Peace on Connecticut Avenue, where Kenny spoke about Irish culture and shook hands with Irish-American business people, the two faced off again.
To reiterate, the Taoiseach said:
(Donoghue:But if someone’s language is racist, are they not racist?)
“It doesn’t follow at all – language and words can be used by people in many regards. My comment was when he was running as a candidate of the election to be held,” explained Kenny.
“I’m not into English classes.”
(Donoghue: “You are a teacher.”)
“The language that was used on that occasion was in my view not that language that I would use but it was not related to his personality.”

“You’re rewriting history,” cut in Donoghue before being swiftly cut off by the government press secretary.
(And we wonder if there are memories of 2002 haunting Enda whenThe Guardianreported how the family of Patrice Lumumba, the assassinated first Prime Minister of Congo, sought an apology from Kenny for using the N-word in what was described as a racist joke.)
Back to today though and concluding, the Taoiseach said that he was glad the meaning of his original comments (in that he was calling Trump the Candidate’s language racist and not Trump the Person racist) were being clarified. He believes his comments had just been taken up wrong all along.
The wind chill in DC is -10 degrees right now.

BREAKING: Judge in Hawaii puts revised federal travel ban on hold.— The Associated Press (@AP)March 15, 2017The Associated Press/ Twitter
BREAKING: Judge in Hawaii puts revised federal travel ban on hold.
A US FEDERAL judge in Hawaii has frozen President Donald Trump’s new travel ban hours before it was to come into effect.
The revised ban blocks new visas for people from six predominantly Muslim countries including Somalia, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Libya and Yemen.
It also temporarily shuts down the US refugee programme.
The ban was due to come into effect from tomorrow 16 March butthe Washington Post reportsthat US District Judge Derrick K. Watson has froze the order nationwide.
During his campaign , the US President had promised to ban Muslims from entering the US.Evan Vucci / PA ImagesEvan Vucci / PA Images / PA Images
The US president initially introduced the wide-ranging travel ban on 27 January for the same six countries plus Iraq, but the order was blocked by judges within weeks.
Today’s hearing came following a lawsuit filed by the State of Hawaii which argued that is unconstitutional.
Trump is due to meet with Taoiseach Enda Kenny in the White House tomorrow.

ENDA KENNY HAS said he doesn’t have to “answer to” Nigel Farage.
The Taoiseach was responding to the MEP and former Ukip leader saying he should apologise to Donald Trump for previously saying remarks by the then US presidential candidate were “racist and dangerous”.
Kenny made the comments in May, in the midst of a very divisive election campaign in the US.
Speaking to reporters in Washington DC today, Kenny told reporters he didn’t call Trump a racist.

“I did not refer to the person, the now president, as being racist. My comment was in respect of his language…
“Language and words can be used by people in many regards. My comments was when he was running as a candidate in respect of the election to be held.
“I’m not into English classes. The language that was used on that occasion was in my view not that language that I would use but it was not related to his personality.”
In terms of Farage, he said:
“I’m responding to an invitation sent by the president of the United States and I’m happy to go to the White House to continue the traditional connection between Ireland and the United States, symbolising the contribution Irish people have made over many centuries and the fact that we want to continue with that.
“I’ve nothing further to say in respect of comments made by Mr Farage.”
‘Vile things’
Earlier, Farage told RTÉ’sToday with Sean O’Rourkehe hopes the first thing the Taoiseach does during his meeting with the US President is “to apologise to Donald Trump for saying vile things about him consistently during the campaign”.
Farage said that might be a good start because “Trump won’t have forgotten that”.

He said “how much more insulting can you be than to call someone racist” adding, “I think he needs to apologise.”
In May of last year, Kenny was asked about some of the then-presidential candidate Trump’s comments. Speaking in the Dáil, Kenny described his rhetoric as both “racist and dangerous”:
Kenny wasthen askedif he regretted making such comments about the man who will soon become the next president of America.
He said maybe Trump will “let bygones be bygones” but he believes Enda Kenny is “wasting his time” trying to sell President Trump “the idea of independent sovereign states like Ireland giving away their ability to make their own laws to Juncker”.
Farage went on to say that Ireland, Germany, France and all other EU member states aren’t sovereign nations because their laws and regulations are overruled by those of the EU.

Farage reiterated comments he made yesterday, saying he’s “frustrated” at the pace of triggering Article 50 to begin Britain’s exit from the EU.
He said he doesn’t think the British Government realises the strength of its position and isn’t being “bold enough”.
He said the UK is now “the biggest export market in the world for the Eurozone” and he said the EU “needs free market access to us even more than we need it the other way around”.
On Nicola Sturgeon’s call for a Scottish independence referendum, he said if he was Prime Minister Theresa May he would say, ‘”Yeah go on, have that referendum, call her bluff, get her to lose heavily and that would be the end of Scottish nationalism for many decades to come.”
Farage is a friend of Trump, and was one of the first people to meet him after the election, flying to the US and taking the famous photo in the gold elevator with the 45th President of the United States.

A LINE SAYING this will be Enda Kenny’s last St Patrick’s Day as Taoiseach was removed from a speech Kenny is set to deliver tonight.
When asked about the speech in Washington DC earlier, Kenny played down the issue, telling reporters: “The speech that you got is not the speech that I’m delivering tonight.
“I’ve already explained to my own parliamentary party my intention and how I intend to go about that.”

Kenny has previously said he will notify Fine Gael of his timeline for stepping down as leader of the party when he returns home from his St Patrick’s week trip to the US.
LGBT rights
Kenny was also asked if he would raise LGBT rights issues with Vice President Mike Pence, who does not support marriage equality and previously called being gay a choice.
“I haven’t met Vice President Pence before but it’s the first time that we’ve ever had two vice presidents of Irish-American connection following each other in the White House.
“I know that the Vice President’s people come from both Sligo and County Clare and clearly immigration and the question of both comprehensive immigration, and also separate from that, the opportunity to have a bilateral arrangement in respect of E3 visas as piloted by Senator [Chuck] Schumer will certainly be of interest to me.”

The Taoiseach said he would bring up the positive aspects of the same-sex marriage referendum passing in Ireland if the opportunity arose.
“The following through by the government of the recommendation from the citizens’ convention was an expression of joy and enthusiasm and exuberance and that fact that, where politics really mattered, 80,000 young people came back to cast their vote in that and it was an extraordinary circumstance where that unbridled joy was evident in our people, so I would give him the Irish experience in that regard,” Kenny said.
The Taoiseach was also asked about MEP and former Ukip leader Nigel Farage earlier telling RTÉ’sToday with Sean O’RourkeKenny should apologise for previously saying comments made by Trump were “racist and dangerous”.
Kenny told reporters he didn’t call Trump a racist, and said he doesn’t have to “answer to” Farage.

The crystal shamrock bowl was designed and crafted by Eamonn Terry.Marcin LewandowskiMarcin Lewandowski
INSPIRED BY THE Book of Kells, engraved with interwoven Celtic lace cuts, painstakingly crafted.
The crystal bowl that Taoiseach Enda Kenny will present to US president Donald Trump on Thursday is not to be sniffed at.
The bowl was created by master craftsman Eamonn Terry, owner and founder of Criostal na Rinne, who was commissioned by the Taoiseach’s office.
Terry designed and cut the crystal bowl. Its top is scalloped to show the brilliance and shine of the crystal; the main pattern is a series of deep intersecting trinity knots, while polished shamrocks are engraved into panels on the bowl.
The entire design is inspired by artwork from the book of Kells, with interwoven Celtic lace cuts set near the base. An uncut panel is also engraved on the bowl.
Eamonn Terry with the bowl.Marcin LewandowskiMarcin Lewandowski
A longstanding tradition between Ireland and the US, Kenny will present the bowl to Trump on Thursday in order to mark the strong ties between Ireland and the US on St Patrick’s Day.
There has been some controversy around the visit, with a number of prominent politicians saying that Kenny should not meet the controversial president.
Junior minister John Halliganlabelled Trump a “sexual predator”over the weekend, objecting to Kenny’s meeting.
The tradition stretches back over 50 years to 1963, when then-US president John F Kennedy was presented with a bowl of shamrock.
Kenny is currently touring the east coast of the US ahead of St Patrick’s Day. He attended the Philadelphia parade on and has been meeting with prominent politicians.
Kenny has had to make some changes to his plans as a result of the incoming snowstorm Storm Stella which is set to batter the east coast.

THE TAOISEACH’S ITINERARY in the US has been changed due to a snowstorm.
Enda Kenny had been due to attend an event honouring John F Kennedy at the JFK Library in Boston tonight.
In a statement, the library said the event has been cancelled due to Storm Stella: “Due to the impending snowstorm, tonight’s forum with Ireland’s Prime Minister Enda Kenny has been cancelled and will not be rescheduled.”

Due to the impending snowstorm, tonight’s forum with An Taoiseach Enda Kenny TD, Ireland PM, has been cancelled and will not be rescheduled.
Kenny met Boston mayor Marty Walsh and Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker earlier today, where they discussed Irish immigrants who are living illegally in the US.

Train
RTÉ Newsis reporting that the Taoiseach has cancelled a series of meetings planned in Rhode Island tomorrow so he can travel to Washington DC via train.
Kenny is expected to attend events there on Wednesday, before meeting US President Donald Trump on Thursday.
The snowstorm has also forced the postponement of Trump’s meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The meeting was due to take place tomorrow but has been pushed back to Friday, the White House has said.
“The president spoke to the Chancellor of Germany. They agreed due to the weather that the meeting should be postponed, rescheduled to March 17th,” Trump’s spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters.

HE MAY HAVE only weeks left in the role of Ireland’s most senior politician – but Enda Kenny was keen to let viewers in the US know exactly what he does for a living, as he encountered a local TV reporter on duty in Philadelphia.
The Fine Gael leader began his week of US St Patrick’s engagements in the City of Brotherly Love yesterday.
Asked how to pronounce his title by the American reporter, the former primary school teacher replied with a well-rehearsed sounding lesson:
“Say it again now for the television,” the Taoiseach exhorted, staring down the camera lens.

According to Fox 29, the Irish in the city have been marking the celebration since 1771.

TAOISEACH ENDA KENNY is the latest political figure to weigh in and tell the Catholic Church that they have an obligation to pay the compensation they owe to survivors of abuse.
Speaking in Philadelphia, Kenny toldRTÉ Newsthat the Church and its congregations should measure up to their responsibility.
“I would expect congregations and the Church to reflect on the seriousness of this and measure up to their requirements,” said the Taoiseach.
“We had a position following the residential institutions and the amount of restitution to be made there, and that hasn’t been – what was set out in the beginning,” he added.
2002 agreement
In 2002, an indemnity agreement was entered into by the Fianna Fáil Government and 18 religious orders. Under this agreement, the congregations agreed to hand over €128 million in cash and property. This was increased to €353 million after the publication of the Ryan report.
In return, the State would indemnify these orders against legal actions from former residents.

However, according to a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG) published by the Department of Education last week, Catholic religious congregations who ran residential institutions where children were abused have paid just 13% of the costs of a redress scheme.
The C&AG finds that only €85 million of that €226 million has been received by the State.
Tuam mother and baby home
It’s over two weeks since it was announced that human remains of babies and infants were buried at the site of a mother and baby home in Tuam, County Galway.
Since then, there has been an outpouring of grief, disbelief and anger, with survivors of these institutions demanding answers from the religious orders and the State.
“For the importance and sensitivity of Tuam and any others that follow we need to try get this as right as we can,” Kenny said yesterday.
“I do hope that the Church and the congregations reflect on the years ahead and that with the State and agencies trying to get this right, particularly for those whose siblings and families were involved to measure up insofar as accepting responsibility or agreements where restitution is concerned and get on with it.”
Health Minister Simon Harris appearing on RTÉ's The Week in Politics yesterday.RTÉRTÉ
Kenny’s message for the Church to “get on with it” comes in tandem to comments made by Health Minister Simon Harris yesterday.
Speaking onRTÉ’s The Week in Politics, Harris said the Church must “pay over and pay up”.
The Government will consider each and every legal tool at our disposal.
There is an outstanding amount under the existing agreement and the current contribution sought from the Church is pathetic and paltry and the fact they haven’t even paid that is going to be pursued immediately.
Harris said there was an understanding that the contribution by Church and State would be 50:50. However, he said the Church has not stepped up to the plate.
“The next time they make a homily and contribute to this public debate they would call on all religious institutions to pay up and that call should go all the way to the Vatican,” said Harris.
He called on the Pope and other religious leaders in the country to intervene and call on institutions pay the money owed.
Archbishop Diarmuid Martin took up that call yesterday evening, and said publicly that the Church’s commitments cannot be reneged upon.
“It is not acceptable the current position but we as a Government will look at all of the levers at our disposal. I want to take action,” said the health minister.
TAOISEACH ENDA KENNY has confirmed that the government is considering introducing online voting to allow the Irish diaspora to vote in presidential elections.
While at the Famine Memorial in Philadelphia as part of his visit to the United States for St Patrick’s Day, Kenny was asked by reporters if they were considering introducing online voting.
A clip, played onMorning Irelandtoday, gave his reply:
“And for that reason we will have to explore all of the opportunities that exist here.”
Speaking on critics of the diaspora vote, Kenny said that the question was for the Irish people, and said that there have been low turnouts in elections here.
He added that Irish people abroad had continuously asked him why they can’t have a more central role in politics in Ireland.
“Having considered this matter over the past period,” he told reporters, “taking into account what the fifth report of the Constitution Convention said, the government last week agreed that we should extend voting rights to emigrants and the Irish diaspora including Northern Ireland, and that we would do that in time, not for the next presidential election, but for the one after that in 2025.”
This month an options paper will be published, which will set out the categories and conditions that the government want people to discuss.
“Also the [compilation] of a new electoral register which will accommodate that, and when those questions are put and answered to our satisfaction and the agreement of everybody, we will then hold a referendum to give effect the extension of voting rights to emigrant people.”
“AMERICA HAS JUST elected a fascist – and I don’t use the word fascist lightly.”
These were the words used by Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin during aSeanad speech he gave last yearafter Donald Trump was elected US president.
The speech went viral, bringing him to the attention of those across the pond.
This week, the Labour senator is in New York for St Patrick’s Day. However, unlike Taoiseach Enda Kenny, he won’t be taking part in the parade.
Instead, Ó Ríordáin will be joined by some well-known faces, such as Irish actor Gabriel Byrne, activist and writer Shaun King, comedian Maeve Higgins and writer Colum McCann, at a protest rally against the Trump administration.
Appearing onMSNBCyesterday, Ó Ríordáin explained the ‘Irish Stand’ event aims to show solidarity between the people of Ireland and immigrants suffering under President Trump.
MSNBC/ YouTube
“I think any Irish-American who celebrates St Patrick’s Day, but also supports the travel ban is somebody who has forgotten what it means to be Irish,” said Ó Ríordáin.
Forgetting the Irish story
He criticised the number of Irish-Americans that work under the Trump administration, stating:
“I think they have completely forgot their Irish heritage, their own history. The Irish story is one of immigration, it is one of seeking refuge, it is one of overcoming sectarianism, and all the stereotypes that are laid against communities in America now were once laid against us.
“Lots of people will join together to make that stand, to remind Irish America that Ireland does not stand with this man and Ireland’s story is one of overcoming diversity,” he said.
The event is due to be held outside the iconic Riverside Church, where Martin Luther King gave his famous Vietnam speech.
Being the first St Patrick’s Day since Trump was elected, Ó Ríordáin said it is important to speak for every immigrant, because Ireland is an immigrant nation.
The Labour senator was reminded by the TV anchor, Joy Reid, that is was not so long ago that signs saying, ‘No blacks, no dogs no Irish’ hung outside shop windows.
Ó Ríordáin agreed, and said it is time for Irish people to reclaim the true meaning of St Patrick’s Day.
The Irish Stand rally will take place at the Riverside Church in New York at 7.30pm on St Patrick’s Day.

IT’S SOMETHING EVERY Irish person has heard said in an American accent at one time or another.
But if US Vice-President Mike Pence and House Speaker Paul Ryan utter these words to the Taoiseach during this week’s St Patrick’s Day celebrations, they won’t have to delve too far into their ancestry to prove it.
Enda Kenny is on a whirlwind trip of the east coast of America this week (with some calling it the farewell tour – he has indicated he will outline a timeline for his departure as Fine Gael leader after 17 March).
While in the US, he is visiting Boston, Rhode Island, Philadelphia, Washington and New York.
He’ll be meeting many high-powered American politicians on his travels, such as those mentioned above, as well as US President Donald Trump (of course) and a handful of governors and business people.
Irish roots
Just like his predecessor Joe Biden, former US congressman and governor of Indiana Mike Pence is central to this year’s St Patrick’s Day celebrations.

He will also be hosting a special breakfast for the Taoiseach at his residence on 16 March (the day Trump will be presented with the traditional bowl of shamrock).

Kenny had high praise for the vice-president last year on Twitter, something he was widely criticised for:
Had a really good conversation tonight with US VP Elect Mike Pence. He certainly knows Ireland and the issues that matter to our people.— Enda Kenny (@EndaKennyTD)November 18, 2016Enda Kenny/ Twitter
Had a really good conversation tonight with US VP Elect Mike Pence. He certainly knows Ireland and the issues that matter to our people.
However, it makes sense that Pence would take a central role this week as he does have bona fide Irish roots.
Pence’s grandfather emigrated to the US from Tubercurry, County Sligo in the 1920s, and it is understood he passed through immigration inspections at Ellis Island.
His great-grandmother came from Doonbeg, County Clare, home to Trump’s famous Irish golf resort. Pence is believed to have been quite close to his grandfather, someone he says was a great inspiration to him.
The vice-president has returned to his ancestral home on many occasions over the years.
In 2009, he told the Irish Voice newspaper how he remembers spending summers in Ireland, cutting turf and saving hay in Clare and Sligo.
Irish Centralreports that Pence also has relatives in Doonbeg in Clare and last visited with his family in 2013, showing up in Morrisey’s Pub on one occasion.
Although raised a Democrat by Irish-Catholic parents, Pence became a born-again Christian and shifted politically to the right.

Hailing from Kilkenny
While Pence is to be guest of honour at Wednesday’s gala dinner in the National Building Museum, the Taoiseach will also meet House Speaker Paul Ryan while in Washington.
Irish Central reportsthat Ryan identifies as Irish-American and even has a Kilkenny GAA jersey hanging in his office.
Clearly proud of his ancestry, he showed it off to Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Charlie Flanagan only last month.

Ryan claims his Irish roots go all the way back to the Famine, explaining that his relatives hail from Kilkenny.
His grandfather, James Ryan arrived in the United States in 1851, in search of the American dream, writes Niall O’Dowd of Irish Central.
What will they talk about?
The undocumented Irish is top of Kenny’s list of talking points during his visit.
With his Irish ancestry, Pence has a history of getting involved in immigration issues.
He was criticised by some Republicans in the past for meeting with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform (ILIR) during the immigration bill battle in 2009.
Whether he will discuss the issue with the Taoiseach – risking the same ire again – is yet to be seen.
The day the Taoiseach is due to meet Trump also happens to be the day the US president’s revised travel ban comes into effect.
The executive order bans entry visas from six Muslim-majority countries: Libya, Iran, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.
Kenny toldTheJournal.iethathe will raise the issue with both Trump and Pence.
When his running mate first floated the idea during his campaign, Pence called the proposed ban on Muslims entering the US “offensive and unconstitutional”.
However, the vice-president has since defended Trump’s stance on the issue.
Flanagan has also raised the issue of Irish immigration with Ryan while on a recent visit to the US.

SPEAKING IN PHILADELPHIA this afternoon, Taoiseach Enda Kenny has said the Government has decided to allow a referendum which would allow emigrants vote for an Irish president.
Kenny said the decision was “in line with the recommendations of the Convention on the Constitution.”
If passed, it would mean those North of the border would be able to cast their vote for the first time.
So, this evening we’re asking:Are you in favour of giving emigrants the right to vote in a presidential election?Poll Results:No(8836)Yes(7205)Don't know(881)YesNoDon't knowVote
TAOISEACH ENDA KENNY has announced that the Government has decided to hold a referendum which would allow citizens living abroad to vote in presidential elections.
Speaking at the Irish Memorial in Philadelphia today, Kenny said the decision was “in line with the recommendations of the Convention on the Constitution.”
Kenny described the announcement as “profound recognition of the importance that Ireland attaches to all of our citizens, wherever they may be.”
If passed, it would mean those North of the border would be able to cast their vote for the first time.
Kenny added that it is an opportunity to make the country stronger by allowing all citizens resident outside the State to vote in future presidential elections.
“I am especially pleased to be making this announcement as we prepare for our worldwide celebration of St Patrick’s Day and of all that is Irish.”
All change
The Government will publish a detailed paper later this month to set out the range of options available to give effect to the recommendation of the Constitutional Convention.
Kenny said that the announcement was also in keeping with arrangements in place in a majority of countries around the world who provide for voting by those of their citizens resident outside the State.
As things currently stand, Irish people who have emigrated abroad are unable to vote in Dáil or presidential elections or in any referendum that takes place in Ireland.
Initial plans for the referendum were announced last year and were broadly welcomed across the political divide.
Fianna Fáil diaspora spokesperson Senator Mark Daly said that the right to vote was the most “fundamental right of any citizen”.
“We must stop denying that right to so many millions of our citizens,” he said.
Welcome
The campaign group Votes for Irish Citizens Abroad (VICA) welcomed the Taoiseach’s announcement. Spokeswoman Mary Hickman said the group is delighted that the government is “finally taking action” on the Convention’s recommendation.
She said: “The vast majority of democratic countries around the world allow their citizens living abroad to vote, and there is no reason why Ireland cannot find a way to make this work.
“VICA is campaigning for Irish citizens to be given the right to vote in all Irish national elections and referendums.
“The #HometoVote movement during the 2015 marriage equality referendum showed the huge appetite there is for such a measure.”

ENDA KENNY HAS said the situation of undocumented Irish in the US is a top priority for him on his visit.
The Taoiseach said he would be raising the issue with President Donald Trump when he speaks to him during the St Patrick’s Day meeting on Thursday.
Speaking at an event in Philadelphia, Kenny said the issue of undocumented Irish living in the US was one of his “absolute priorities” in meeting the president and vice-president Mike Pence.
“It will be no surprise to anyone here that one of my absolute priorities in meeting Vice President Pence, President Trump and other senior political figures this coming week is to renew the strong case on behalf of the hard-working, tax-paying Irish people in the United States,” Kenny told the crowd at an Irish American dinner in Philadelphia.
“We all understand that immigration reform is a politically sensitive issue,” he said.
There are an estimated 50,000 Irish people living and working in the US without official legal status. Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric since his election has worried this large group about what the future holds.
Kenny said that Irish in the US without legal status had been “living in the shadows” for too long and that they wanted “nothing more than to continue making their contribution to this great country”.
Kenny also spoke of Ireland’s improving economic situation, saying that the country was emerging from its financial difficulties “with renewed strength and confidence”.
He lauded the continued relationship between Ireland and the Irish American community, saying that the country would “continue to cherish the bonds we have here in the United States”.
Kenny is in the US for the annual St Patrick’s Day celebrations. He will meet with US president Trump and Pence on Thursday, when he will hand over a bowl of shamrocks.
LAST TUESDAY IN Leader’s questions, Enda Kenny said, “no nuns broke into our homes to kidnap our children. We gave them up to what we convinced ourselves was the nuns’ care”.
After numerous reports since the 90s, after the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, the McAleese Report, and the subsequent redress schemes, this is what the Taoiseach had to contribute around the deplorable events that are being uncovered.
The Taoiseach and various other high profile government politicians have made similar remarks in relation to the financial crisis, and the subsequent recession in Ireland, that it was our fault that we partied too hard.
Here, we have it all over again: it’s our fault that children were incarcerated in these institutions.
Revisionism of our horrible history
Not only is this statement a complete revisionism of our very recent murky history of institutionalised welfare, but it completely lets the Catholic Church and the state off the hook.
Actually, they, (along with the state), did kidnap our children. Parents did not send their children to industrial schools because they wanted to; parents sent them there either because a court compelled them to, or because they had no choice, (as the state’s policy was to give child payments to the Religious Orders rather than directly to the parents).
I am the daughter of a survivor of a Christian Brother institution, and my grandmother certainly did not have my father sent to these institutions at will; in her case she was a widow who couldn’t afford to keep her children.
The Laundries

The same can be said for children born in Mother and Baby Homes.
Having interviewed people who were incarcerated in Magdalene Laundries, industrial schools and Mother and Baby Homes for numerous research projects, not only were these institutions intimately intertwined, but mothers who gave birth in these horrific places, (usually due to the fact they had no financial or familial support), had to give up their children unwillingly.
Not only were their children taken away from them, they were sold off to be adopted in places like the US, and many of the women ended up in Magdalene Laundries after they spent 18 months or so looking after the baby they were not allowed to keep.
Government must admit to legacy of Church-state relationship
Enda Kenny also said he wanted to be the Taoiseach to “once and for all deal with the sad legacies of the past”. With statements like the above, he is so far off from this.
Ultimately until he and other government politicians can admit to the deplorable legacy of the relationship between the Church and the political elite in Ireland, he will never fully deal with this.
What he didn’t say was that women were incarcerated in Magdalene Laundries or forced to give birth in Mother and Baby Homes because of the Catholic Church’s morals and values around sex and sexuality.
What he didn’t say was that children were incarcerated in industrial and reformatory schools because this was the Catholic Church (and the state’s response) to child welfare in Ireland, and the terms for sentencing a child to one of these institutions were widened in order to provide a continuous flow of children (and funding) for these institutions.
And this is the problem with inquiries conducted in a piecemeal fashion; they do not allow us to see the bigger picture.
We need to keep exposing the Church and state’s role in this system of abuse because it is only by doing this will we see an end to Catholic control, in legislation that controls women’s bodies, and in the domains of education and welfare.

BERTIE AHERN HAS said he doesn’t think Ireland is “mad enough” to leave the EU.
The former Taoiseach made the comments in an interview about Brexitwith Sky News.
Ahern said the impact of the UK leaving the EU will be “enormous” on Ireland, saying the food sector will be particularly badly hit as about 45% of perishable items in the industry are exported to the UK.
In terms of the border between the Republic of Ireland and the North, Ahern said: “The whole border issue is a nightmare for us.
“I had hoped that the UK would not pull out of the customs union because that was never really mentioned last summer … People were talking about the single market, they were talking about the European Union … and then on 17 January the prime minister said, ‘Yeah, we’re leaving the customs union.’
“That draws a big difficulty for us for the very simple reason that the border between North and South, between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, becomes the natural border between the European Union and the United Kingdom,” Ahern said.
St Patrick’s week
Speaking to reporters at an EU summit in Brussels earlier, Enda Kenny called for clarity on the type of relationship Britain wants with the EU post-Brexit and what this could mean for Ireland.
In his weekly message, the Taoiseach said he will use his St Patrick’s week trip to the US to reaffirm Ireland’s commitment to the EU.
“Accordingly, the message I will take with me to the United States across the next seven days will be one of reassurance in terms of Ireland’s commitment to maintaining our current position as the gateway to Europe for US investors…
“Ireland’s absolute commitment to remain at the heart of Europe in spite of Brexit is set to be a theme of each and every ministerial visit abroad this St Patrick’s Day and I have asked each minister to report back to Cabinet on their return in this regard,” Kenny said.
TAOISEACH ENDA KENNY has said he will raise the issue of Donald Trump’s new travel ban with the US president when he is in Washington next week.
Trump’s revised travel ban will come into effect on 16 March, the same day Kenny is scheduled to meet Trump in the White House.
The US President signed a revised executive order on Monday banning entry visas from six Muslim-majority countries: Libya, Iran, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.
When asked byTheJournal.ieif he would be raising it as a matter of concern, he replied:
Revised ban
The US president initially introduced the wide-ranging travel ban on 27 January for the six countries plus Iraq, but the order was blocked by judges within weeks.
The revised ban says that the six countries were targeted because their screening and information capabilities could not meet US security requirements.
The previous ban was enforced immediately and it caused travel chaos at US airport and numerous travellers being stuck in limbo.
Kenny made the comments this morning at the launch of the government’s new trade strategy at Dublin Port.
Cabinet reshuffle
At the same press conference, Minister for Transport Shane Ross, who is one of the only members of government not travelling abroad for the St Patrick’s Day festivities, said he will miss his Cabinet colleagues while they are away on their “very important” trips.
Ross joked that he planned to make some changes while the Taoiseach is out-of-town.
Top of his list is a Cabinet reshuffle, he said, where he plans to put Junior Minister John Halligan into Health.
Joking aside, the Taoiseach spoke about the possible policy changes by the US administration and their impact on Irish trade.
He said the US bilateral agreement on trade is a “top priority” for the country, but said the government had to be cognisant of any changes introduced by President Trump.
Tax rate
The Taoiseach said Ireland’s corporate tax rate is a matter for the Irish government, just as the US rate is a matter for their own administration.
Last week, during his first Congressional address, Trump indicated there would be a large cut in its corporate tax rate.
Kenny said there is no threat to US companies pulling out of Ireland, despite Trump threatening to impose heavy taxes on American companies that move jobs overseas.
“Speaking to one chief executive last week, who is planning a major expansion here, when I asked him what is the president’s view about this, he said, ‘well, he mightn’t be too pleased about it, but we are investing heavily in the United States too.”
As well as visiting Washington, Kenny is scheduled to visit Philadelphia, Boston, New York and Rhode Island next week.
TAOISEACH ENDA KENNY will meet US President Donald Trump on the day Trump’s new travel ban comes into effect.
The US President signed a revised executive order yesterday banning entry visas from six Muslim-majority countries: Libya, Iran, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen
PreviouslyKenny has said he disagrees with US President Donald Trump’s immigration travel ban and said he will tell him that to his face when he meets him during his St Patrick’s Day visit.
But people are saying that the occasion, the celebration of Irish emigrants, coupled with the travel ban being introduced the day before his arrival, warrants Kenny to make a public speech voicing his objection.

TAOISEACH ENDA KENNY used strong and emotive words in the Dáil today when discussing the Tuam mother and baby home revelations.
Today, Children’s Minister Katherine Zappone agreed to carry out a “small scoping exercise” to assess if it is possible to expand the existing terms of reference to include other homes into the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes.
Speaking in response to a question from Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin in the Dáil today, Kenny said, “we gave them up because of our perverse, in fact, morbid relationship with what is called respectability”.
The Taoiseach was addressing the Dáil following last week’s revelations that substantial amounts of human remains were discovered on the site of a former mother and baby home in Tuam, County Galway.
Since the discovery, a number of survivors have called for the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes to be expanded.
In consultation with the commission, Zappone is due to announce details of the scoping exercise after the St Patrick’s Day weekend.
Remains found in Tuam
Last Friday, Zapponeconfirmed a significant number of human remains– of children aged up to two and three years – had been found at the site of the former mother and baby home, run by the Bon Secours sisters, in Tuam.
Two test excavations of the Galway site discovered “significant quantities of human remains in a structure which appears to be “related to the treatment or containment of sewerage.
Speaking toTheJournal.iein Tuam on Friday, local historian Catherine Corless, who brought the issue to light in 2014, said she now feels vindicated.
In the last few days, survivors of mother and baby homes have been speaking out about their experiences.
Patrick Joseph Havertytold this publicationthat he wants a formal apology from the State and the Bon Secours religious order.
As it stands, the commission chaired by Judge Yvonne Murphy, is tasked with examining 14 mother and baby homes around the country, in addition to four county homes.
Sinn Féin’s Mary Lou McDonald said it is vital that other mother and baby homes are brought under the remit of the investigation.

This revised ban will not come into effect until 16 March, the same day Kenny is scheduled to meet Trump in the White House.
The timing is sure to add increased international media interest into the meeting of Trump and Kenny.
The first travel ban led to calls for the Taoiseach to reconsider the usual protocol in visiting the White House for St. Patrick’s Day.
Fine Gael said that the Taoiseach will attend the meeting with Trump and “will continue to act in the interest of Irish people”.
As well as visiting Washington, Kenny is scheduled to visit Philadelphia, Boston, New York and Rhode Island.

Updated 9:15pm
MINISTER FOR HEALTH Simon Harris has definitively ruled himself out of the upcoming Fine Gael leadership battle, but Tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald has said she “is seriously considering” entering the race.
Harris, who is aged just 30, had been seen in some quarters as something of a dark horse candidate, most especially after a message from Foreign Affairs Minister Charlie Flanagan was leaked to the media which indicated Harris was interested in running.
“At present there is no vacancy and that’s a matter for the Taoiseach,” he toldRTÉ’s Today with Seán O’Rourkethis morning.
“But I’ve thought about this, I’m flattered to be asked but the time is not right for me.”
“I’m gaining an awful lot of experience in the role I’m working in, and that’s where I want my full focus to be, so I won’t be a candidate,” he added.
For some, the suggestion that Harris might run was seen as an implicit endorsement on his part of Housing’s Simon Coveney – given that the younger Harris could be seen to split support for Minister for Social Protection Leo Varadkar.
Now that he has officially ruled himself out, where his endorsement will now go is unclear. He denied that he had encouraged speculation that he might run for the leadership.
“I certainly didn’t encourage it. You know it came out by Whatsapp, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs clarified that was meant to be some sort of a joke,” Harris said.
Harris added it would be “inappropriate” to give his support to any candidate at present.
“I serve at the pleasure of the Taoiseach, and the Taoiseach has not yet indicated his own intentions,” he added.

When asked to comment on her own position, Minister for Justice Fitzgerald said she was considering the matter “very seriously”.
She said: “The last time there was a Fine Gael election for leader, there were four candidates.
She added that while the topic was on her mind, she would wait until Enda Kenny steps down before making any definitive statement on the matter.
With reporting from Sean Murray
TAOISEACH ENDA KENNY has describedthe revelations of the “significant number” of human remainsat the site of the former mother and baby home in Tuam, Co Galway, as “truly appalling”.
Citingthe work done by historian Catherine Corlessto bring this issue to light, Kenny said that the way babies of single mothers were treated in this country was “akin to some kind of sub-species”.
The Taoiseachalso told RTÉthat it was up to the coroner and everyone involved to “see how best we can proceed with the next step in this case, and possibly others”.
Kenny said that Minister for Children Katherine Zappone was liaising with the Commission of Investigation into the mother and baby homes to see what next steps should be taken, and evaluate if the commission’s terms of reference needed to be extended.
The Fine Gael leader said: “This is not something which happened way back at the dawn of history.
He added the discovery put those whose siblings died in the home in a “horrendous situation” and said that the situation needed to be dealt with as quickly, as effectively and as sensitively as possible.

Updated 2.30pm
PARTIES IN NORTHERN Ireland are currently engaging in talks with a view to agree a power-sharing agreement.
Party leaders are set to meet Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire today. Following the election, Brokenshire called for “urgent discussions” to see the devolved parliament get back on track.
“Now that assembly members have been elected, there is a limited window in which the assembly and executive can be restored,” he said.
Parties have three weeks to form a government. If this deadline passes, Brokenshire is legally obliged call another election. However, as the last Assembly election only took place in 2016, there is little appetite for this.
A possible return to direct rule from Westminster is also on the table. If the deadline is missed, the UK government could pass emergency legislation to suspend devolution for the first time in a decade in order to allow time for more negotiations.
No unionist majority
There’s a new dynamic in Northern politics following last Thursday’s election, which ended a unionist majority at Stormont – something that had been present since the province was established in 1921.

Here’s how the 90 seats were filled:
Sinn Féin has said the party won’t work the DUP if Arlene Foster is nominated to retain her position as First Minister.
The snap election was triggered in January when Sinn Féin’s Martin McGuinness resigned as Deputy First Minister over the long-running Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) or‘cash for ash’ scandal.
The move came after Foster had ignored repeated calls for her to step aside while an investigation is carried out into the scheme – which could cost taxpayers in the North in the region of £400 million (about €460 million).
Arlene Foster, leader of the Democratic Unionist PartyBrian Lawless PA Wire / PA ImagesBrian Lawless PA Wire / PA Images / PA Images
Senior DUP sources have told the Belfast Telegraph Foster should consider her role and not put pride before what is best for “the party and the people of Northern Ireland”.
Speaking toRTÉ’s News at One, Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams said of the RHI controversy, “Arlene is not acceptable as First Minister until this matter is cleared up.”
He said Sinn Féin is not calling for her to step down as DUP leader, saying this is a matter for her and her party.
“There’s a special role here for the British government particularly, and the British government – in terms of its stance on Brexit, in terms of its refusal to implement agreements in the past – have created the atmosphere which forced Martin McGuinness to resign on the back of the RHI scandal.
“So the British government need to come up to the mark on all of this. We’re looking for them to come forward with a plan, we don’t want plámas, we don’t want to be patronised.”
Adams said he is meeting Brokenshire with Sinn Féin’s Northern leader Michelle O’Neill this afternoon and will again raise the issue of a special designated status for the North when Britain leaves the European Union.
He added that his party is not yet looking beyond the three-week deadline.
Extension for talks?
Meanwhile, former Northern Ireland Secretary of State Theresa Villiers toldBBC Radio 4′s Today programmeshe thinks the three-week window is too short and should be extended.
“The law at the moment requires a fresh election after three weeks if there is no coalition formed … I think it will be important for the secretary of state to have legislation ready to give the parties more time.
“I think it would be a pity if they were launched back into yet another election just after three weeks,” Villiers said.
Kenny and May
Taoiseach Enda Kenny and British Prime Minister Theresa May spoke over phone on about the issue yesterday. Meanwhile, Brokenshire and Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Charlie Flanagan will hold talks with the parties on Wednesday.
“They discussed their shared commitment to work with the parties to move forward and create a stable administration which ensures a strong, peaceful and prosperous Northern Ireland,” a spokesman for May said.
The British and Irish leaders will hold further talks on the fate of the Assembly at an EU summit on Thursday, he added.
The Taoiseach’s office said the two leaders will stay in close contact over the political situation, stressing the aim of “re-establishing a functioning executive as soon as possible”.

Over 5,000 readers like you already have stepped up. For the price of one cup of coffee each week you can make a difference.
ALMOST HALF OF Fine Gael voters would prefer Simon Coveney to replace Enda Kenny as leader – if it were a head-to-head contest with Leo Varadkar.
That’s according to an MRBI opinion poll published in today’s Irish Times.
It found that 49% of Fine Gael supporters would choose the Housing Minister Simon Coveney compared to 44% for the Social Protection Minister Leo Varadkar.
Enda Kenny has said he will make an announcement about his future when he returns from Washington after St Patrick’s Day.
The next leader will be chosen by an electoral college of parliamentary party members, elected councillors and party members.
Coveney also came out on top when all voters – not just Fine Gael – were asked to choose between the two. Coveney came out on 40% while Varadkar had 38%.
However, when all voters were given the option of all potential candidates in the election, Varadkar took the top spot with 30%, Coveney (28%), Richard Bruton (6%), Paschal Donohoe (4%), Frances Fitzgerald (4%) and Simon Harris (2%).
Over a fifth of all voters (22%) said they didn’t know.
The survey was carried out among 1,200 voters at over 100 sampling points in all constituencies on Monday and Tuesday.
TAOISEACH ENDA KENNY has rejected the assertions made by former cabinet and party colleague Alan Shatter, who today said that Kenny put him under pressure to resign and that the Fine Gael leader has a “casual relationship with the truth”.
In a government statement rebuking Shatter, the former Minister for Justice’s resignation later where he said Kenny was “an extraordinary Taoiseach doing an extraordinary job” was referenced.
Furthermore, it was indicated that the Guerin report had been removed from all government websites.
Yesterday, Shatterissued a statementto say he welcomed the judgement from the Court of Appeal, which ruled that the “seriously damaging” conclusions of the Guerin report were reached “in breach of fair procedures”.
He called on the Taoiseach to arrange for the “immediate withdrawal of the report in its present form” from circulation and from the Houses of the Oireachtas, and said he was entitled to an immediate apology from Kenny on behalf of the State.
OnRTÉ’s Today with Sean O’Rourke, Shatter reiterated these calls for redress for the manner in which he was treated, that led to his eventual resignation.
Shatter said he had got a “clear message” from Kenny that he had to go, when the Taoiseach saidhe wouldn’t be able to express confidence in him before the Dáil.
“The Taoiseach was wrong to have dealt with the matter they way he did,” Shatter claimed.
When asked if he was sacked by Enda Kenny, he said “yes, of course I was”.
Shatter said thatthe details of the Fennelly Reportshowed that Kenny, “in some areas, has a casual relationship with the truth”.
The Fennelly report concerned the circumstances of Martin Callinan stepping down as Garda commissioner.
He said there was a deafening silence from members of the Oireachtas on his ongoing legal challenge. He said, without the Court of Appeal judgement, any of them could be “wrongly denounced” in a report without stating their case or defending their name.
The former Minister also said he was mocked and accused of being arrogant for claiming no wrongdoing in the wake of the Guerin report.
Shatter added that there was never anything inappropriate said to him by former garda commissioner Martin Callinan or current commissioner Nóirín O’Sullivan about Maurice McCabe.
Government response
In response to Shatter’s latest comment, a government report stated:
FORMER MINISTER FOR Justice Alan Shatter has said that the contents of the Guerin report should be eradicated from public record, after a Court of Appeal today ruled that the “seriously damaging” conclusions of that report were reached “in breach of fair procedures”.
The Guerin report, published in 2014, focused on Shatter’s handling of complaints made by garda whistleblower Sergeant Maurice McCabe.
Shatterresigned in the wake of the report’s findings, but maintained that he had not acted wrongly in the affair.
In May 2016, Shatter was clearedof wrongdoing in his handling of garda corruption allegationsby the O’Higgins Commission.
He wonhis appeal to challenge the Guerin report in November, and has welcomed today’s verdict from the Court of Appeal.
He called on Taoiseach Enda Kenny to arrange for the “immediate withdrawal of the report in its present form” from circulation and from the Houses of the Oireachtas.
He accused Kenny of failing to acknowledge, on Dáil record, that the conclusions of Seán Guerin were reached “without a fair hearing and in breach of [his] constitutional rights”.
Shatter said he particularly welcomed the acknowledgement of Mr Justice Ryan that it would be a “hollow victory” if the “objectionable conclusions” of the Guerin report remained unamended in public record.
The former Minister added that he hoped today’s decision will “result in this protracted and painful saga brought to an end”.
O’HigginsCommission
The Guerin report dealt with a very specific set of allegations made by Maurice McCabe and the degree to which Alan Shatter was aware about these allegations of garda misconduct.
Shatter said that he only read three chapters of the report but that it had been enough to prompt his resignation, despite never having met with the author of the report Seán Guerin.
At the time, he said: “I would have expected, if it was his intention to reach a conclusion or form an opinion with regard to my concern with regard to the issues raised by Sergeant McCabe, that he would have done so.”
Upon the publication of the report from the O’Higgins Commission, Minister for Justice Frances Fitzgerald noted that Shatter had “acted appropriately with these issues”.
In his statement today, Shatter said: “It is also disappointing that following publication of O’Higgins, despite the cost to the public purse,  it was necessary that the proceedings before the Court of Appeal took place as a contested hearing.
He added that as the conclusions of the Guerin report were relied upon by the “Taoiseach, Ministers, party leaders and other Dáil deputies”, it was now “overdue and only right” that its conclusions be amended in the Dáil record.

“IT IS A historic day for our Travellers and a proud day for Ireland.”
There were several rounds of applause and a standing ovation last night in the Dáil as Traveller ethnicity was officially recognised.
As many as 200 Travellers had come to Leinster House to welcome the announcement, the AAA-PBP’s Bríd Smith told the Chamber, leaving many stranded outside as all public viewing areas were filled.
Those who did make it into the Dáil were told by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle that although clapping from the public gallery is generally not accepted, “this was a special day”, and he offered a round of applause from TDs to those watching.
In his speech, Taoiseach Enda Kenny said he hopes the move will have a “transformative effect” on relations between Travellers and the wider community, and ended his speech with some Cant:
This translates as:
Watch the clip above to see the Dáil break into a standing ovation.
JUST ONE PERCENTAGE point separates Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, a new opinion poll has found.
Micheal Martin’s party currently stands on 29% with Fine Gael on 28%, according to figures from a poll carried out by Ipsos MRBI on behalf of The Irish Times.
Sinn Féin is on 21%, Labour is on 4% and independents and others have an 18% share of the vote.
With little to separate the two main parties, the biggest winner from this poll appears to be Sinn Féín who are also expected to return a number of MLA’s in the North’s Assembly election today. The republican party is currently enjoying its highest approval rating in five years.
Big gains
The survey was carried out on Monday and Tuesday of last week and sampled 1,200 people between the ages of 18. The margin of error is plus or minus 2.8%.
At the weekend, a Sunday Business Post poll had shown how support for Sinn Féin was up to 19%. Meanwhile, AAA-PBP’s support was up two points to 6%.
According to this poll, Fianna Fáil was down one point to 26%, while Fine Gael was at 24%. Fianna Fáil remains the party with the greatest support in the country.
THE TAOISEACH HAS taken the historic step of recognising Traveller ethnicity in the Dáil.
Speaking in the chamber this evening, Enda Kenny said that the recognition would allow young Travellers “feel the same sense of hope and opportunity as every other young person in Ireland”.
Using the example of a 17-year-old named Robbie, Kenny said that he was deeply moved by a representation made to him earlier this month.
“On 6February last, I invited representatives of the main Traveller organisations to the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy to discuss this with Minister Stanton and other senior ministers.
“The representatives spoke passionately about how this strong message from the State would be a very important symbolic and positive step in acknowledging the uniqueness of Traveller identity.They felt it would resonate strongly among the community and help counter the stigma and shame felt by many, particularly young people, and increase feelings of respect, self-esteem and inclusion.
“I was deeply moved as the Group spoke of their own personal experiences including their personal hopes and dreams for their own children to fulfil all their ambitions.
Kenny continued and formally, as Taoiseach, recognised Travellers as a distinct ethnic group.
“As Taoiseach I wish to now formally recognise Travellers as a distinct ethnic group within the Irish nation.
“It is a historic day for our Travellers and a proud day for Ireland.
“May all the people of our nation live in the shelter and never in the shadow of each other.”
The Children’s Rights Alliance “warmly welcomed” the news.
“Today is an extraordinary day for Ireland and momentous for the thousands of Traveller children who have suffered for too long from exclusion and discrimination. Today, a grievous wrong has begun to be righted.”
Locked out
Before the speeches, there was an argument around 150 or so Traveller activists who were left at the gate during the speeches.
AAA-PBP TD Bríd Smith had asked for them to be allowed watch from inside Leinster House, but was told that the public gallery was full and there wasn’t enough staff to accompany them to a coffee dock or party meeting rooms.
Kenny’s speech in full:
His future ahead of him, the world at his feet….Yet he walks with his head down.
No more.
His mother, his family, his Traveller community want Robbie to feel the same sense of hope and opportunity as every other young person in this country.
So do I.
So does this House of public representatives.
Today’s Statement of Recognition of Travellers as an Ethnic Group will go some way to ensuring Robbie and his entire Traveller family have a better future with less negativity, exclusion and marginalisation.
As the House is aware, the Traveller community has for many years campaigned to have their unique heritage, culture and identify formally recognised by the Irish State.
And in this State, they make their contribution as Gardaí, doctors, members of the defence forces, prison officers.
So there should be no surprise that a person can identify as Irish and as Traveller. This is a deep and personal issue for many Travellers.
On the 6th of February last, I invited representatives of the main Traveller organisations to the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy to discuss this with Minister Stanton and other senior ministers.
The representatives spoke passionately about how this strong message from the State would be a very important symbolic and positive step in acknowledging the uniqueness of Traveller identity.They felt it would resonate strongly among the community and help counter the stigma and shame felt by many, particularly young people, and increase feelings of respect, self-esteem and inclusion.
I was deeply moved as the Group spoke of their own personal experiences including their personal hopes and dreams for their own children to fulfil all their ambitions.
We all want the same for our children: to grow up and thrive in a society where everyone is free to be who they truly are. No one should have to hide their religion, their sexual orientation, their race or culture to be respected or even accepted in society.
And across society, as we discussed, there are also darker elements that challenge the law of the land that must be tackled. The Traveller community is not immune to this.
I hope that today will create a new platform for positive engagement by the Traveller community and Government together in seeking sustainable solutions which are based on respect and on an honest dialogue.
That recent engagement and these Statements from all leaders in the House will further help generate mutual recognition and respect between the Traveller and settled communities.
For some time, Ireland has implicitly recognised Travellers as having a distinct ethnic identity:By reporting since 2000 to the Council of Europe on the situation of Travellers in Ireland in our periodic reports on the Council’s Framework Convention on National Minorities;
By reporting on the situation of Travellers to the UN and Council of Europe in our periodic reports on the main international conventions/monitoring bodies against racism;
And by explicitly naming Travellers as a protected group in our equality legislation.
Since the eighties, Pavee Point together with the Irish Traveller Movement, the National Traveller Women’s Forum and Minceirs Whidden have campaigned strongly on behalf of Travellers. They have worked hard with the community to improve living conditions, promote health and education and access to services.
They have sought to empower Travellers and have not been afraid to help them address some of their own internal challenges.
Minister of State Stanton is also finalising a new National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy.
That Inclusion Strategy is intended to bring about important changes to the lives of the Traveller and Roma communities in Ireland.
The campaign for recognition of Travellers in Ireland as a specific ethnic group of the Irish nation, with their own unique heritage, culture and traditions has of course been part of the discussions for the new Strategy.
It doesn’t surprise us – in the context of relationships and self-identities within the island of Ireland – that a person can identify in different and sometimes overlapping ways.
We recognise as part of the Good Friday Agreement that a person can identify as Irish, Northern Ireland or British and that this self-identification can vary with greater emotional commitment to one or other element depending on the circumstances.Under the same Good Friday Agreement, we formally recognise the identity of people of Ulster Scots heritage including in the 3 border counties and support the development of their unique heritage and culture, without prejudice to their equal citizenship in and loyalty to this Republic.
Our Traveller Community is an integral part of our society for over a millennium, with their own distinct identity – a people within our people.
I have to say it a great pleasure for me to be the person that has the honour of making this statement.
I must acknowledge David Stanton, Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality and the national Traveller organisations who undertook substantial work to bring clarity to the debate.
Together we agreed that recognition of Travellers could have a transformative effect on relations between Travellers and the wider society, and will create no new individual, constitutional or financial rights.
Because of course, Travellers already enjoy all the human rights and responsibilities that are afforded for all people under our constitution and laws. The acceptance and implementation of those rights and responsibilities has to work both ways in order for society to function effectively, inclusively and with mutual respect for all citizens.
We recognise the inequalities and discrimination that the Traveller community faces and have a range of special programmes and interventions. The development of the new National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy will build on this.
As Taoiseach I wish to now formally recognise Travellers as a distinct ethnic group within the Irish nation.
It is a historic day for our Travellers and a proud day for Ireland.
Lá iontach tábhactach é seo do lucht Taisteal na Tíre – La d’ár saol mar a déarfá.
May all the people of our nation live in the shelter and never in the shadow of each other.
A FORMER US Governor and White House candidate has issued a strongly-worded appeal for Enda Kenny to boycott the traditional St Patrick’s Day visit to the White House this year, calling on the Taoiseach to speak up for “human decency” and “truth”.
Martin O’Malley, who was Governor of Maryland and ran against Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders in the Democrat primaries in 2016, said it was “not a time to be giving bowls of shamrock and tricolour lapel pins to white supremacists with Irish surnames” – a reference to President Trump’s controversial advisor, Steve Bannon.
O’Malley is also appealing to Irish-American politicians to boycott the administration’s St Patrick’s events in protest at Trump’s immigration policies. His message has already been picked upby a number of US outlets.The former Governor has also started a petition and a social media campaign with the hashtag #noshamrocks.
Speaking on Morning Ireland, O’Malley described Trump’s policies as “evil”.
US “immigrant internment camps” were already “the largest in the free world,” he said. “When this happens the only thing that’s needed for success is for good people not to stand up.”
Muslim ban
Trump referred to Mexicans as rapists “bringing crime” and called for a complete ban on Muslims entering America during his White House campaign. Since taking office, he’s attempted to introduce a travel ban targeting seven Muslim-majority nations, and signed an executive order significantly widening the net for deportations.
O’Malley said his actions were ”disgusting” and ran counter to everything the Irish and wider immigrant experience had been about.
His dismissed the Irish Government’s argument that the St Patrick’s visit provided Ireland with access to key political and business figures in the US.
“This guy is the very embodiment of the very sort of know-nothing white supremacist our great-grandparents, who emigrated from Ireland, had to confront when they came to the United States of America, and it’s shameful that any Irish-American politician with any awareness of history would condone this guy or bless his behaviour by drinking green beers with him and toasting a bowl of shamrocks.
ALLEGATIONS OF ABUSE against four other service users at the ‘Grace’ foster home have been highlighted in a newly-released report.
Two reports into the controversy were released yesterday. The Conal Devine investigation concluded in 2012, while the Resilience Ireland (RI) concluded in 2015. The release of the reports was delayed for legal reasons.
In 2015,RTÉ’s This Weekrevealed the story of ‘Grace’ – a young woman with profound intellectual disabilities who was left in a foster home in the Waterford area for almost 20 years despite a succession of sexual and physical abuse allegations.
In 1995, on the back of these claims, the South Eastern Health Board decided not to place any further people in the home. However, a decision to remove Grace was overturned in 1996. As a result she stayed in the home until a whistleblower’s complaint in 2009.
Also in 1996, allegations of abuse connected to a different service user at the home were reported to An Garda Síochána, one of a number of issues outlined in the RI Report.
Four cases
The reports released yesterday show that47 children were placed in the homeover a 20-year period.
The Devine Report looked into Grace’s case, while the RI Report looked at the 46 other service users who were placed with the foster family primarily in the period 1983-1995.
The RI Report notes that during the course of the enquiry four service users were formally identified by An Garda Síochána “initially to the HSE who then made appropriate referrals to Tusla”.
The report found that:
It recommended that further investigations be carried out into these cases.
Apology
Commenting on yesterday’s publication of the reports, Aileen Colley, chief officer of the HSE’s community healthcare organisation in the south-east, said: “The HSE is concerned at the serious deficits in the care provided to children and young adults with an intellectual disability who had placements with this family, primarily during the 1980s and early 1990s.
“It is important to reassure those concerned, and the wider public, that the HSE did not wait for the reports to be published in order to commence a structured process, and working closely with Tusla, to address the deficiencies identified in child care and disability services, and to act on the reports’ recommendations.
“These recommendations capture the extent and nature of the failings in the service, the learnings of which continue to be implemented locally and nationally. Significant developments have already taken place in both child care and disability services since 2010/2011 and this continues to be the case.”
Last year, the government announced a statutory commission of investigation into the scandal would be established. Minister of State for Disabilities Finian McGrath will bring the terms of reference for the commission to Cabinet next week.
Speaking in the Dáil yesterday, Taoiseach Enda Kenny said: “The treatment of [Grace] is a disgrace to us as a country.
“These two reports speak for themselves and they are shocking.”
THE DEATH OF former TD Peter Mathews (65) was announced earlier today, leading to many tributes and people remembering hiscontribution to politics.
The financial consultant and political commentator was elected to the Dáil as a Fine Gael TD in the Dublin South constituency in 2011, but left the party in 2013 after voting against the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill.
Mathews was elected in the five-seat Dublin South constituency in the 2011 general election. However, he failed to be re-elected as an independent TD in the three-seat Dublin Rathdown constituency last year. He ran in the February 2016 election despite announcing he had oesophageal cancer the same month.
The circumstances under which he left Fine Gael have somewhat overshadowed his contribution to politics, but for many he is better known as a vocal commentator during the aftermath of the economic crash and bank guarantee.
He clashed with Fine Gael on a number of occasions, ruffling some feathers in 2011 when he said he hadmore experiencethan Finance Minister Michael Noonan.
In March 2012, the Fine Gael and Labour members of the Oireachtas’ all-party finance committee were beaten by 11 votes to nine on a motion put forward by Mathews seeking a hearing with the thenCentral Bank governor Patrick Honohanabout the controversial Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes deal.
Mathews, still a member of Fine Gael at the time, tabled the proposal but voted against it in line with the party whip. It was an embarrassing defeat for the government.
In January 2013, meanwhile, Mathews was “spoken to” by then government chief whip Paul Kehoe over his attendance at a Ballyheaanti-bank bailout protest meeting.
An unlikely ally
MEP and former TD Luke ‘Ming’ Flanagan paid tribute to Mathews today, saying his death “shocked and saddened” him.
“We came from very different backgrounds and very different political perspectives but we both arrived at the Dáil on the same day, first-time TDs after the February 2011 election, with similar ambition on one major issue – challenge the bank debt that had been forced on the Irish people.
Flanagan said he thought Mathews was “a natural for promotion to the Cabinet”, given his financial expertise, but this wasn’t to be.
He was critical of Enda Kenny’s decision to consign Mathews to the back benches, saying Fine Gael knows “how to deal with upstarts with knowledge and intelligence – silence them”. Flanagan said he believed this “rejection” by the Taoiseach “left a deep scar” on Mathews’ belief system.
“Ireland is today a poorer place without Peter,” he added.
Kenny said he was “deeply saddened” by Mathews’ death, adding he “served his constituents with commitment and energy” – both when in Fine Gael and as an independent.
Bank officials
In a grilling of bank officials by the Oireachtas Finance Committee in September 2013, Mathews didn’t hold back. He said the banking sector “abandoned its prudential principles” and “created a credit asset bubble”.

“How dare a banking sector think that they’re entitled to collect all the loans that are secured on that asset which they have helped to pump up, consistently, for six years. That’s wrong,” he stated.
Mathews said the then Socialist TD Joe Higgins was right when he said it was wrong for “€70 billion of private losses” to be absorbed by the public.
TwitterTwitter
The decision to not put Mathews on the Oireachtas banking inquiry committee, given his financial knowledge, was criticised by opposition TDs.
Finian McGrath, now an Independent Alliance junior minister, described the move as “a major mistake”.
Mathews’ proposed motion to compel bank executives from the period 2001 to 2008 to appear before the committee was also voted down.
Kicked out

In his final months as a TD, Mathews was ejected from the Dáil chamber on a number of occasions.
He frequently clashed with the then Ceann Comhairle Seán Barrett after raising unrelated issues during the order of business, such as Bank of Ireland’srestrictions on over-the-counter lodgementsand theIBRC loans controversy.
Mathews will also be remembered for hispro-life views, which ultimately saw him leave Fine Gael in 2011.
In his letter resigning from the party, he wrote: “Unfortunately I have been placed in a position by the leadership of the party that has led me to this decision.”
At the time he toldRTÉ Newshe signed a document pledging to support Fine Gael policy when he joined the party but said: “I pointed out at the time that I would not be signing a blind political loyalty to some areas that might be more important and more core …  life and death matters.”

TAOISEACH ENDA KENNY has said any Brexit deal needs to include a provision to allow Northern Ireland to rejoin the EU should reunification with the Republic ever happen.
Kenny’s comments represent a re-stating of policies he’s discussed before. He was answering questions after a meeting in Brussels with European Commission President Jean Claude Junker and the EU’s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.
Speaking last month he said that while a united Ireland wasn’t something he was interested in pursuing as part of the talks, language relating to the possibility should be retained as part of the UK’s exit deal.
“The Good Friday Agreement has been referred to by [Junker],” the Taoiseach said today.
The Taoiseach has been talking about reunification and the Good Friday Agreement in relation to Brexit since last summer.
“The discussions and negotiations that will take place over the next period should take into account the possibility, however far out that it might be, that the clause in the Good Friday Agreement might be triggered,” he said,after commenting on the issue at the MacGill summer school in Donegal’s Glenties in the weeks after the Brexit vote.

En route Brussels to meet BelgianPM & Pres Junker of the Commission to discuss Brexit. These discussions will become serious in months ahead
Kenny will be back in Brussels for more Brexit-related meetings next week– this time with European Council President Donald Tusk and European Parliament President Antonio Tajani as well as Barnier.
The much-anticipated European Council meeting where UK Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to formally trigger Article 50, signalling the start to the Brexit negotiations, also takes place next month on 9 and 10 March.
Speaking today Kenny said he also believed the triggering of the provision would be delayed, telling reporters:
AFTER STARING DOWN the barrel of a heave, Taoiseach Enda Kenny satisfied Fine Gael TDs at last night’s parliamentary party meeting by stating he will deal with the leadership issue when he returns from the US after St Patrick’s Day.
The Taoiseach’s message to the meeting, which lasted less than 10 minutes, was greeted with a standing ovation in the room.
However, before the issue resurfaces Kenny has a full schedule of diplomatic events to deal with.
First up, he’s jetting off to Brussels (weather permitting) for a series of meetings in relation to Brexit. He is expected to highlight Ireland’s concerns arising from the UK’s decision, including Northern Ireland and the peace process, with Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel.
Brexit-related meetings
The Taoiseach will also meet with European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker today.
Kenny is expected to emphasise the importance of an “orderly and constructive” negotiation process that protects both EU and Irish interests.
This day next week (2 March), he’s back to Brussels for more Brexit-related meetings – this time with European Council President Donald Tusk, European Parliament President Antonio Tajani and lead negotiator Michel Barnier.
No sooner as he landed back in Ireland, the Taoiseach is to return to Belgium for the much-anticipated European Council meeting where UK Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to formally trigger Article 50, signalling the start to Brexit.
White House visit
After all that Brexit talk, Kenny will travel to the US on 15 March, for a two-day trip to Washington DC.
Kenny will present US President Donald Trump with a bowl of shamrocks at the White House, before travelling to New York, where he will celebrate St Patrick’s Day, and perhaps take in the parade.
It’s believed the US trip will be extended to other cities, but the Taoiseach will have to be back before 25 March as he is due to attend a meeting of EU heads in Rome for the 60th anniversary of the Rome treaty.
After that, it’s off to Malta. He will attend the European People’s Party Congress from 29-30 March.
In early April, Kenny is due to attend yet more Brexit-related meetings and in mid-April he is off on a trade mission to Germany.
A busy time ahead for the Taoiseach – but also an important time in which leadership contenders can get their campaigns on track.

Micheál Martin is up. “We are on the verge of a major transport strike,” he says.
He accuses the government of sitting on its hands over the last few years when it comes to dealing with Bus Eireann.
“The workers have to bear the entire brunt,” says Martin.
Transport Minister Shane Ross is hiding, according to the Fianna Fáil leader who says Ross is hiding behind the industrial relations fig leaf.
He says there should not be a race to the bottom when trying to find a solution. He urges Minister Ross to engage with the negotiations.
HELLO THERE ALL, Christina Finn taking the blog for today’s Leaders’ Questions.
Enda Kenny must be glad to see the back of last week, which wasone disaster after anotherfor the government.
However, Kenny is facing into a raft of more problems this week. Pressure has been mounting on the Taoiseach to outline a timeline for when he will step aside.
We’ll see how this plays out today.

That is an appalling indictment on the government, says Martin.
He says the initiatives announced before Christmas have not paid off.
The lack of any meaningful change on the supply side is also of concern to him.
Martin said the minister for housing was on the radio over the weekend giving the Taoiseach a timeline for his departure.
“The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government was on the media over the weekend giving the Taoiseach a deadline and a timeline in terms of when he should leave office.  I think it would have been far more focused of the Minister if he concentrated on what is an appalling emergency for thousands of families in this country, one that is going to get worse because of the lack of tangible action and effective outcomes from all of the strategies that have been announced.”
FF Timmy Dooley chimes in: “What do you think, Charlie?  Do you think Simon wants out of housing?”

“These are significant houses where there were no houses at all being built,” says Kenny.
“Talking about 2021 is of cold comfort to people,” says Martin.
They want answers now, Taoiseach… it is more than just PR.
Taking a dig at the two leading contenders in the Fine Gael leadership battle, he says people are fed up of the “Simon and Leo” show.
Martin wants ministers to focus on their jobs.
“All we are listening to is that one minister wants to get out of health,” adds the Fianna Fáil leader.
Young minster Harris is enjoying the latest honour of his career, says the Taoiseach.
Gerry Adams says most people outside of the Fine Gael bubble don’t care who takes his place.
Adams reads back comments from October 2015 where Enda Kenny said there was a choice of “stability versus chaos”.
He tells the Dáil that his party has brought chaos upon themselves in the last few days.
“Get off the chaos carousel,” says Adams, who says he wants the Transport Minister Shane Ross to sort out the Bus Eireann problem.
The carousel is different than the trampoline, says Kenny.
Kenny says the problem is only going to be sorted out through constructive dialogue.
The National Roads Authority will ensure that rural routes will be maintained, adds the Taoiseach.
Adams clarifies that Martin McGuinness stepped down for good reasons in the North. He says Kenny should respect that.
“It is about a public service, that is why it is called public transport,” says Adams.
He wants a commitment that Ross will get involved and sort it out.
“This is a difficult dispute,” Kenny points out. He says he wants both sides to get together.
The Taoiseach says the headlines that the free travel pass is at risk is false. This was pointed out during a Transport Oireachtas Committee some weeks back.

Tommy Broughan TD is now talking about PRSI contributions and pensions.
Is it not time over the next number of years for the restoration of pensions for those born in the 1940s, asks Broughan, who points out it is women who have been particularly impacted.
Age Action has claimed that 35,000 people have had their pensions cut because of government changes to the State Pension introduced in 2012, with many losing more than €1,500 a year.

He said it is a valid question for so many people.
“Of course it has to be dealt with, ahead of Budget 2018,” says Kenny.
Broughan said this cohort of people worked hard and contributed to society.
“We will have the issue referred to the Oireachtas Committee for Budgetary Oversight,” says Kenny.

Deputy Séamus Healy is raising the issue of rural transport.
Kenny says rural transport can not be left to the marketplace. “And it is not.”
“Nothing is decided here,” adds the Taoiseach.
Healy also raises a number of other issues relating to south Tipperary.
Healy is now reading out figures relating to the reduction in subvention to Bus Eireann.
He wants to know if the Taoiseach will reassert Irish sovereignty by telling the EU that Ireland intends to borrow money (above what is permitted) for our housing and transport needs.
More on all of that here:
The Taoiseach says the European Investment Bank has opened here, which is to be welcomed in terms of infrastructural investment.
He concludes Leaders’ Questions by saying a man at a Brexit meeting told him recently:
“I find you guilty. I find you guilty of clogging up the roads with getting people back to work.”
Martin says (with a wry smile) that it’s central to the delivery of the Programme for Government that a government be in place.
He wonders if Kenny will perhaps make his plans known to the House.
“So there is no change. You can have opinions one way or another. The government are focused on doing the job for the people of the country.

Updated 10.15pm
AN TAOISEACH ENDA Kenny was in joking form this earlier this evening about the challenge facing him in the days ahead over his leadership of Fine Gael.
Addressing the crowd at an event in Balla, Co Mayo – his home country – Kenny joked about the serious challenges he faces as pressure mounts for him to announce when he will step down as leader of Fine Gael.
“Fr Denis blessed the place there today,” Kenny told the crowd, as opened the Balla Community Woodlands project.
“A very ecumenical blessing. He gave me a blessing as well when he was at it,” the Taoiseach said to laughs from the crowd and applause.
Kenny refused to answer any further questions about his leadership ahead of his addressing a Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting on Wednesday, where he is expected the lay out his timeline for stepping down as leader of the party.
Earlier, Health Minister Simon Harris took a sideswipe at the sense of humour of one of his Cabinet colleagues as he answered questions about the expected Fine Gael leadership battle.
It followed the leaking of an internal Whatsapp conversation between Fine Gael members. Details published yesterday in the Irish Times showed Foreign Affairs Minister Charlie Flanagan suggest that Tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald was urging Health Minister Simon Harris to enter the leadership contest.
Fine Gael TD Pat Breen made the comment “Your man is doing well” to which Flanagan answered: “Thanks. He hasn’t announced yet but Frances is encouraging him. He wants out of Health”.
In a tweet yesterday Harris said he wasn’t going to indulge in idle speculation about the leadership, while, speaking earlier, Flanagan described his comment in the group as jovial Sunday afternoon banter.
Speaking to RTÉ at an event today, Harris said:
Working as hard as I possibly can in my job as Health Minister. Lots to do! No intention of engaging in idle speculation— Simon Harris TD (@SimonHarrisTD)February 19, 2017Simon Harris TD/ Twitter
Working as hard as I possibly can in my job as Health Minister. Lots to do! No intention of engaging in idle speculation
However, he refused to say if he would be putting his name forward for the leadership contest, telling reporters that if and when a vacancy arose he would consider his position.
Harris is not the only minister to refuse to rule out entering the race today. Education Minister Richard Bruton, who led an ill-fated heave against Kenny in 2010, was also asked by reporters about his intentions.
He would only say that he believed we were at a time when there was a “significant threat to Ireland” and noted the “serious challenges” that were being posed, without directly answering the question about the leadership.

Elsewhere, Tánaiste and Minister for Justice Frances Fitzgerald said she’d wait for Enda Kenny to declare his plans before declaring her position on a leadership bid.
Speaking in Brussels today, Finance Minister Michael Noonan said that he expected Kenny to lay out the timeline for his departure when he addresses the party on Wednesday.
Space
The Taoiseach has been under increasing pressure since last week when members of his own party amplified their calls for him to set out a timeline for his retirement.
The speculation was heightened yesterday as the contents of the Whatsapp group became public knowledge.
Kenny said in advance of last year’s general election that he wouldn’t lead his party into a subsequent election and pressure on his position grew in the wake of a poor Dáil performance, as the country reeled from the latest Garda whistleblower revelations.
Housing Minister Simon Coveney said yesterday that Kenny deserves space to make his decision. That’s despite Coveney and Leo Varadkar last week saying the party needs to be on an election footing.
Speakingon RTÉ’s the Week in Politics, Coveney said that he feels Kenny should be given the space to make his own decision.
Coveney added that the transition to a new leader within Fine Gael “needs to be done relatively soon” but declined to be more specific than that.
Apublic opinion poll released yesterday morningshowed that support for Fine Gael is dropping and a large majority of people are unhappy with Kenny’s leadership of the country.

ENDA KENNY IS expected to set out his timeline for a transition of power within Fine Gael this Wednesday when he meets party colleagues, after growing pressure on his position and days of speculation.
We don’t know yet whether it will be a long or short goodbye – but either way, it’s clear the Mayo TD’s time as Taoiseach is coming to an end.
The idea that he could take over a newly-created brief as Brexit minister gained traction on Marian Finucane’s RTÉ show yesterday morning – and in a poll for the Sunday Business Post last month nearly three-quarters of respondents said they’d like to see a new dedicated ministerial role to deal with the Brexit fallout.

POLITICAL WATCHERS ON both sides of the Atlantic have had more than enough to occupy their attention as of late with extraordinary developments unfolding at breakneck pace.
Here in Ireland, additional troubling revelations about the shocking treatment of the Garda whistleblower Sergeant Maurice McCabe resulted in serious unrest within the Fine Gael-led Government and provoked Sinn Féin to table a motion of no confidence in the Government.
A contrary motion prevailed, but the controversy has badly damaged the reputations of some key figures and exposed very deep divisions. Although it seems that the Government will survive, it now is clear that Enda Kenny will not be Taoiseach for much longer.

Meanwhile, in the United States, President Donald Trump fired his National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, purportedly because he misled Vice President Mike Pence by claiming that he had not discussed sanctions imposed on Russia in the waning days of the Obama administration when he spoke with that country’s US Ambassador in late December.
Having denied that any such conversation took place repeatedly in the national media, Pence was furious to learn – evidently through the media – that it had. Yet it also has emerged that President Trump was informed by then Acting Attorney General Sally Yates weeks ago that the topic of sanctions came up.
So, two scandals have come to light in two very different nations that are 3,000 miles away from one another. They are not entirely dissimilar, however. Each is a “who knew what and when did they know it?” episode of high political intrigue that – for the present moment, at least – has dwarfed the far more important crisis that precipitated it.
The potential longer term political consequences and the impact on these overarching crises of the recent, frenetic days on both sides of the Atlantic merit further examination.
Fine Gael is at a fork in the road. Like him or loathe him, Enda Kenny has been at the helm of the party for many years. And his track record, in many ways, is unassailable. As such, choosing a new leader – always a big decision – is hugely significant.
Leo Varadkar has long been considered his probable successor. Yet his near celebrity status as a politician will certainly take a hit in the weeks and months to come. Critics call him mercurial; even his allies say the cut and thrust of politics is an unwelcome feature on his radar screen. Varadkar’s will not be a coronation, and Simon Coveney will prove a difficult opponent. The outcome could eventually result from the rather labyrinthine system the party has for selecting its leader.
At the same time, Fianna Fáil, though seemingly holding all the cards in the wake of a very solid opinion poll this month, is also in uncharted territory. How much longer will the party endorse the “confidence and supply” arrangement? How will it react to a new Fine Gael leader? If a fresh face appeals to the public, might some in the party argue that Micheál Martin should have pushed for a vote against the Government and that his unwillingness to do so is just the latest evidence of his indecisive nature?
These complex twists and turns, however, won’t solve any of the obvious problems within An Garda Síochána or ameliorate the plight of Sergeant McCabe and his family (and others). With yet another public inquiry regarding the conduct of the country’s police force upon us, it’s only logical to question if anything will ever change. Some advocates posit that external voices are needed. Others assert that they will be drowned out. It is hard to know who is right, but it is distressing to think of where things stand.
Stateside, President Trump appears determined to obscure the sentiment that brought him to the White House. His “America First” message, in a country where the dominant mood is isolationist and pessimistic, is a political winner. But the president’s outsized ego cannot withstand even the most superficial of questioning. Reasonable doubts are castigated as “fake news”.

The Trump administration’s posturing on Russia and other issues is so bizarre because it is so unnecessary. The reality is that most Americans do not want more military interventions, which they believe are futile, and deem Russian incursion in Eastern Europe as a problem that does not implicate vital US interests. They think difficulties in a region 4,000 miles away are a matter for Europeans to resolve. Accordingly, why the Trump administration would resort to back channels with Russia and invite cogent criticism from conspiracy theorists, rather than openly engage diplomatically, defies logic.
An improved relationship with Russia would be a good thing for the US and for the rest of the world. That this truism – not to mention the sudden, Damascus-like conversion that the global left has had to the moral probity of the CIA and FBI – is the subject of denial is another sad consequence of what Americans decided last November. That Donald Trump, who espoused views that are impossible to classify or reconcile ideologically, was elected president, in itself, suggests that strict adherents on the right and left need to get over themselves.
Here and there, this was a wild week in politics. And those who say they know what lies ahead are either clairvoyant or just plain wrong.

THE MINISTER FOR Foreign Affairs, Charlie Flanagan, has described messages showing him endorsing Health Minister Simon Harris as a candidate for the Fine Gael leadership as “tongue-in-cheek”.
As reported in the Irish Times, an internal Whatsapp conversation between Fine Gael members shows Flanagan suggesting that Tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald was urging Harris to enter the leadership contest.
Fine Gael TD Pat Breen makes the comment “Your man is doing well” to which Flanagan answers: “Thanks. He hasn’t announced yet but Frances is encouraging him. He wants out of Health”.
Simon Harris for his part, tweeted that he had “no intention of engaging in idle speculation”.

Working as hard as I possibly can in my job as Health Minister. Lots to do! No intention of engaging in idle speculation
The Whatsapp conversation emerged on what has been another day of developments within the party as speculation about the future of Enda Kenny and the future leader of Fine Gael continues.
Taoiseach Enda Kenny has said that he will not be making any further comment on “the leadership issue” until this Wednesday, at the earliest.
He is due to address Fine Gael colleagues at a parliamentary party meeting that day, and had indicated that no further comment will be made as speculation persists around when he will step down, and who will replace him as leader.
It is believed that no motion of confidence will be put down against the Taoiseach now, but the expectation is that Kenny will have to set a timeline for his departure at the party meeting this week or risk facing this same situation again.
Earlier today, Simon Coveney said that fellow minister Leo Varadkar “wants to push things” in relation to the departure of Kenny as Fine Gael leader.
Coveney and Varadkar are seen as the frontrunners to lead the party when Kenny steps down and Varadkar yesterday released a statement saying that the current uncertainty is “distracting and destabilising”.
Varadkar stopped short of calling for a statement from Kenny, but said that: “everyone is waiting to hear from the Taoiseach.”
But speakingon RTÉ’s the Week in Politics, Coveney said that he feels Kenny should be given the space to make his own decision.
Coveney was speaking on RTÉ's The Week in Politics today.RTÉRTÉ
“I think the emphasis has been a bit different from Leo and from me. He wants to push things and wants clarity from the Taoiseach on timelines,” the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government said.
Coveney added that the transition to a new leader within Fine Gael “needs to be done relatively soon” but declined to be more specific than that.
“The Taoiseach has led Fine Gael for 15 years, he’s led the country through a storm for the last six years, I think he deserves the trust of the party to be able to manage an orderly transition.”

Varadkar later issued a statement to say that he agreed with Coveney’s timeline for Kenny’s departure.
Speaking earlier this morning onThe Marian Finucane Show, Fine Gael MEP Brian Hayes said that Kenny should be part of the EU’s initial response after the UK triggers Article 50.
He explained that the EU Council then has six weeks to produce its guidelines for the negotiations on the UK’s exit from the EU.
“So I think it would not be in the country’s interest if Enda Kenny was removed over the next month or so or even over that period of time,” Hayes said.
Apublic opinion poll released this morningshowed that support for Fine Gael is dropping and a large majority of people are unhappy with Kenny’s leadership of the country.

DUBLIN’S SHERIFF STREET area is set to get a facelift and be “rebranded”.
As part of the government’s new initiative to boost the Dublin’s north inner city, the area is to get a €5 million funding injection.
A report, drafted by Kieran Mulvey, formerly of the Workplace Relations Commission, aims to turn the area, which is just a stone’s throw from some of the multi-national banks and businesses in the IFSC, from a “run down, no-go” area to a “modern and attractive” place for people to work and live.
What’s in the plan?
There are commitments for there to be no signs of dereliction, with good street lighting, trees and greenery.
In order to achieve this, calls forestablishing a ‘Docklands Tax’appear to have made some impact.
Novel ways to eradicate derelict sites are to be explored, including the possibility of a levy on unused sites in the area, as well as dedicated contributions from Nama, IFSC businesses and the Central Bank (which is due to open in the region soon).
A combined contribution of €10 million over a three-year period to a “renewal fund” would revitalise the urban landscape, said Mulvey.
While there are calls for more social housing in the area, the report highlights five areas for large-scale infrastructure investment:
Mountjoy SquareGoogle MapsGoogle Maps
Big refurbishment plans
Mountjoy Square Park is one of five historic Georgian squares in Dublin, and the report’s author calls for it to be restored to its original design.
Aldborough House, the second largest private residence built in the 18th century in Georgian Dublin, outside of Leinster House, is now in private ownership.
Mulvey states there are plans to refurbish the iconic building, however he said if this is not achieved, consideration should be given for it to be acquired by government.
Aldborough HouseGoogle MapsGoogle Maps
New pedestrian cycle and transport routes are to be developed, with a push to get businesses to locate in the area.
The report finds there is a deep sense among locals of being “left behind” during the Celtic Tiger period, with a lot of “false promises” made.
Councillor Éilis Ryan criticised the report and said the focus of “narrative changing” is deeply disappointing.
Job opportunities in the area
She said jobs and the inequality those living in the area face should be the focus.
During the launch of the report this week, a local man told Taoiseach Enda Kennyabout the discrimination he faced living in the area, particularly when applying for a job.
Kenny said the report highlights the need to break the cycle of unemployment by ensuring the large multinationals located in the area give back.
He said corporate social responsibility efforts need to be made, whereby targeted career pathways are offered to post-primary students in the area.
Above all, Mulvey said locals need to feel the north inner city is an important part of the capital.
Updated 6.30pm
MINISTER FOR SOCIAL Protection, Leo Varadkar, has issued a statement this evening urging Taoiseach Enda Kenny to address the current leadership situation of Fine Gael.
He said that, although he has “full confidence” in Kenny to settle the issue, everyone was waiting to hear him have his say on if, and when, he will step down as Taoiseach and leader of the party.
He said: “Everyone is waiting to hear from the Taoiseach.
Earlier today, Fine Gael’s Chief Whip said that she can “categorically guarantee” that there’s no orchestrated campaign to unseat Enda Kenny and replace him with a new leader.
Speaking onRTÉ’s Saturday with Claire Byrne, Regina Doherty called for Kenny to be given respect “as a human being” to make his own decision regarding his future.
Regina Doherty says Enda Kenny has her support to make his own decision.Eamonn Farrell / RollingNews.ieEamonn Farrell / RollingNews.ie / RollingNews.ie
“He has done a tremendous amount for us in Fine Gael and just for that, if for no other reason, he deserves the due respect and regard to give him the bit of space to talk to his friends and his family to make decisions himself,” Doherty said.
“This man is an inherently decent man,” the Meath East TD added.
“At the very least have respect for him as a human being, let him go home to his family, his loved ones, his friends and close colleagues to have a conversation.”
The ongoing debate about Kenny’s future comes after his some party TDs have begun calling publicly for him to step down.
Alan Farrell TD yesterday calledKenny’s position “untenable” but Doherty said she was opposed to TDs putting ultimatums on front of the party leader.
“Don’t start this second guessing business or this even blackmailing business because it’s unedifying and actually we’re better than that,” she said.
In a move that was seen by many as a starting gun in the leadership contest, senior ministers Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney told the Fine Gael parliamentary party this week that members need to be prepared for an election should one arise.

Doherty denied, however, that she’s seen any evidence that either man is eager to begin the contest proper.
“From my interactions none of the declared, even though there are none declared, but the obvious candidates. They are not impatient in the sense of drawing them or putting markers down for next Wednesday,” she said.
Responding to reports that Varadkar was behind moves to have other TDs withdraw support for Kenny, Doherty says nothing so organised is taking place.
“There is no orchestrated campaign kicked off yet, I can absolutely categorically guarantee that. It hasn’t, I have not witnessed it.”

THE CONTROVERSY OVER Fine Gael’s leadership is continuing into the weekend.
Earlier todayAlan Farrell became the first Fine Gael TD to say he has no confidence in Enda Kenny.

FINE GAEL TD for Dublin Fingal Alan Farrell has become the first TD from Enda Kenny’s own party to officially declare his position to be “untenable”.
The Taoiseach’s standing has been called into question in spectacular fashion since a gaffe-filled week regarding the government’s handling of the Maurice McCabe whistleblower controversy.
While Kenny himself has resisted putting a timeline on his own departure, he had been warned by his own backbenchers that he must do so or face a motion of no confidence in his leadership.
This afternoon Farrell said: “Unfortunately, I no longer have confidence in the ability of Enda Kenny TD to lead Fine Gael and I believe his position is now untenable.”

Farrell was most recently in the news for kicking off a sustained scandal involving Sinn Féin in early December by suggesting, under Dáil privilege, that two of their TDs had knowledge concerning the death of prison officer Brian Stackat the hands of the IRA in 1984.
His statement continues:
“Fine Gael, as a party in government, requires a leader who can manage the party in a manner which inspires faith amongst the parliamentary party, our local representatives and the wider membership.”
“We must be prepared to tackle the challenges which arise in our society. In doing so we require a leader who can lead with confidence, and highlight how the values and principles of Fine Gael can best benefit our society and every community across our “country.”
Over the last number of days, we as a party have stumbled from one crisis to another, highlighting how fragile our arrangement as a minority government is. Not only were we close to an election once, I firmly believe we came close three times. If anything should be learned from the events of the last few days it is that we must be ready for an election at any time.”
“As the co-author of a recent internal party report, I am very much in tune with the feelings and position of our membership, right across the country. A week does not go by that a further comment from another constituency arrives. In a democratic organisation, that is not healthy and thus, I reluctantly withdraw my support for the continued tenure of Enda Kenny TD as leader of Fine Gael,” he concluded.

THIS IS WHAT a young man from Dublin’s north inner city claims was said about him when applying for a job in the area.
The local man, Paul McKeown, stood up in Sheriff Street Youth Centre last night and told the Taoiseach that he has experienced discrimination while job-seeking, despite having a Master’s degree and being fluent in Portuguese.
In the midst of a turbulent week in his own personal career, Taoiseach Enda Kenny was in a packed-out hall for the launch of the north inner city task force report.
The Mulvey report, which was commissioned during the summer in the wake of a run of gangland killings in the city centre associated with the Hutch-Kinahan gangland feud, has big goals to regenerate the area.
Discrimination and stigma
Kenny, who said he will look into McKeown’s individual situation, said the young man had seen correspondence after his interview describing him in such a way.
“No one, no one should have to deal with that,” said Kenny speaking about the blatant discrimination.
Enda Kenny with Finian McGrath in Sheriff Street last night.RollingNews.ieRollingNews.ie
One of the overriding themes in Mulvey’s report is how the area can leave “the stigma of the past behind while retaining its proud history”.
Kenny told the media last night that he has met with the leading companies located in and around Sheriff Street to instruct them to integrate their business into the community to ensure there are fair job opportunities and training opportunities for local people. A number of apprenticeship programmes are to be announced next week, the Taoiseach confirmed.
Last night, Kenny and other ministers, including Paschal Donohoe, Damien English and Finian McGrath, listened to the stories from the local people about life in the area.
While the report was widely welcomed, some are sceptical because they have heard promises before and yet – due to a lack of government will and commitment – nothing changed.
The government has accepted the report’s recommendations and committed an additional €5 million funding for the area. This is in addition to the €4.7 million received in 2016.
Gardaí on the streets
The key recommendations in the report include boosting police resources in the area, with 30 additional gardaí on the beat by end 2017. The report also commits to the reopening of the Fitzgibbon Street Garda Station.
There were big questions hanging over the Rutland Street School, but tonight Minister for Expenditure and Reform Paschal Donohoe acknowledged that although the planned upgrade had fallen through in the past, he was now standing firmly behind its upgrade and development as a community hub. It will also remain State ownership, he said.
There are also big promises to improve the physical landscape of the area with one action calling for the “rebranding” of the area – specifically renaming it Dublin’s North Inner City Quarter.
When put to the Taoiseach that many locals have heard all these promises before, with some even stating this evening that they will never become a reality, Kenny said “they’re wrong”.
“We’re going to prove it. It’s not the case of publishing this report and then throwing the report out the window… we’re going to deliver.”
The Taoiseach said the implementation of the plan will be overseen by the Secretary General in his department, with a special community office also opening up in the area.
Updated 1.15pm
THE MORIARTY TRIBUNAL kicked off in 1997 to look into the financial affairs of Charlie Haughey and Michael Lowry – and twenty years on, it continues to cost the State money.
Taoiseach Enda Kenny told the Oireachtas Finance Committee yesterday the Moriarty Tribunal has cost €54.7 million to date.
This year, an additional €10 million for legal costs will be spent.
Officially called the Tribunal of Inquiry into certain Payments to Politicians and Related Matters, it took 14 years to find that former Fine Gael minister Michael Lowryhad an “insidious and pervasive” influenceover the awarding of Ireland’s second mobile phone licence in the 1990s to Denis O’Brien’s Esat Digifone company.
Lowry is currently still a sitting TD for Tipperary. He rejects the findings of the Tribunal, as does O’Brien.
Extra €10 million
“The monies here – the extra €10 million – is an increase of 122% [on last year's budgeted Tribunal costs], because of the Moriarty Tribunal and the expected third-party legal costs,” said Kenny.
Leon FarrellLeon Farrell
Breaking down the costs of the Moriarty Tribunal further, Kenny said €35.58 million had been spent on legal fees; €9.764 million had been spent on administration; €6.84 million was spent on third party costs; and €2.55 million was spent on other payments.
He said the 2017 budget is considerably higher than last year, as the €10 million bill is due for payment this year.
The Taoiseach also outlined the costs of other Tribunals to date:
This week, the government approved the setting up of another Tribunal to investigate the alleged smear campaign against Garda whistleblower Maurice McCabe.
Originally, it was proposed that a commission of investigation be carried out, a method of inquiry that has proved a lot more popular in recent years compared with tribunals as they are generally shorter and seen as more cost effective.
The Taoiseach said the cost of a commission of investigation would be far less than a full Tribunal of inquiry.
Fianna Fáil’s John McGuinness asked the Taoiseach if there were any cost controls when a full inquiry is established.
“Is it open-ended?” asked McGuinness.
“Practically,” replied Kenny.
“There are no set controls on the costs for a public inquiry… because every witness is entitled to full legal representation,” said the Taoiseach.
The issue of costs was also raised by Fianna Fáil’s justice spokesperson, Jim O’Callaghan during the debate on the terms of reference of the newly established Tribunal.
OireachtasOireachtas
He said the government needed to ensure ”the costs don’t run exorbitantly high”.
People appearing before the Tribunal should be told the State will only pay a certain amount towards legal fees, said O’Callaghan who added that those who want to pay out more should have to pay for it themselves.
“We do know the perils of going the Tribunal route but in this instance the issues are so grave and they go to the heart of to the administration of justice,” Fianna Fáil party leader Micheál Martin toldTheJournal.ietoday.

He agreed the payments in legal fees need to be capped.
Obviously from the outset of the inquiry we need to make sure we limit the costs as much as we possible can and do so in a reasonable manner.
Sinn Féin’s Pearse Doherty made similar calls for the government to be cognisant of costs.
“It is wrong for us to proceed to establish a tribunal under the 1921 Act. We all know that legislation is flawed in the area of costs.”
He said the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill 2005 (which has been languishing atcommittee stage since 2011) deals with limiting the costs of tribunals of investigation. The legislation has been approved by the Attorney General.
Doherty said the part of the legislation which deals with the reduction of costs should pass before the establishment of the Charleton inquiry. He said:
Do I want to stall in any way this tribunal of inquiry being established?  No, I do not, but do we have an ability in this House and the Seanad to introduce that part of the 2005 Bill in the next week? Yes, we do. It would allow the sole member of the Tribunal of inquiry to tell each witness the amount for which they would be covered for legal costs.
“No longer would we have witnesses coming in with five barristers and two junior counsels looking to recoup their costs from the State. It would be the judge who would decide what is appropriate for legal representation to be paid by the State.
No longer would public relations consultants be allowed to be hired by witnesses and have their costs paid by the State. It would allow the Minister to set regulations to cap the amount paid for legal representation. We have the ability to do this. It is very simple.
THE TAOISEACH HAS refused to give any indication of when he may be stepping down, instead saying he’s focused on his job.
Enda Kenny is under pressure to name the date for his departure with his own TDs demanding he give a timeline.
But speaking at a press conference launching the north inner city task force report, the Fine Gael leader gave nothing away.

Fine Gael’s vice-chairman Pat Deering has threatened a motion of no confidence next week if Kenny has not announced a timeline for his departure as party leader.
Earlier this afternoon Kenny seemed to acknowledge he was under pressure when the chairman of the Finance Committee wished him well.
He told Kenny, “These are difficult times and I want to wish you well personally”. The Fine Gael leader simply responded, ”C’est la vie”.
RollingNews.ieRollingNews.ie
It’s clear that there’ll be a host of Fine Gael TDs in a queue to replace Kenny when he does steps down.
Both Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney told their party colleagues they needed to prepare for an early election during a parliamentary party meeting last night.
While there has been speculation in the past that there could be a few Cabinet members interested in the job of Taoiseach, it really comes down to a two-horse race between Varadkar and Coveney.

THERE’S NO QUESTION about it – Leon Farrell’s photo of a forlorn-looking Enda Kenny underneath the word ‘help’ is the Irish news photo of the week.
The symbolism (as symbolism tends to) speaks volumes.
In the wake of last night’s confidence vote and speculation about the Taoiseach’s leadership of Fine Gael, it’s no surprise that the three main broadsheet newspapers all chose the photo for their front pages.

The format – politician pictured under unfortunate word – is a standard one for photojournalists. Attend any press conference and you’ll spot the photographers hovering around figuring out where the exits signs are – in case the resulting photo may be of use in the coming weeks, months or even years.
How do politicians let themselves get engineered into such hapless scenarios, you might wonder… Perhaps they ought to think twice about appearing in front of giant signs displaying inappropriate phrases?
For the most part, that’s a consideration that falls to press advisers. “An occupational hazard,” is how one experienced handler described the process to us this morning.
“Photographers are very inventive – they have an eye. They’ll usually spot something that even someone in that kind of advisory role mightn’t be tuned into,”Richard Moore, who has advised government ministers as well as business and media figures over his decades-long career, said.

“Invariably if you had time you would arrive in advance of any minister or senior politician because usually you get a chance to talk to the journalists beforehand – but you could also scope the surrounding area.
“You’d keep a weather eye out for something – but then again the photograph might only be relevant if the politician is in the eye of a storm. But invariably there is a backdrop somewhere – it’s a common enough thing, where they’ll frame a photograph with maybe half a word or a word that’s germane at the time [see examples above].
RollingNews.ieRollingNews.ie
Some eventualities are nearly impossible to plan for, Moore said – like, for instance, photoshoots at museums that might include exhibits of antique swords: “You’ll get captions like – ‘is the minister for the chop?’”.
Most politicians and advisers take a ‘win some, lose some’ approach, he reckons. Moore also recalled an event at DCU during the 2011 presidential election, when he was working for Sean Gallagher (an independent candidate with Fianna Fáil links, but who wasn’t keen to talk up his connection to the party, considering their toxic, post-crash status).
“There were a number of student stalls, I remember. And I noticed out of the corner of my eye photographers gathering at a certain stall – which was the Ógra Fianna Fáil stall. You just make sure he doesn’t walk by there – they knew I twigged them, and there was a bit of a smile and wink between us.
“That phrase comes to mind … ‘I have to be lucky all the time, they only have to be lucky once’.”
RollingNews.ieRollingNews.ie
Photojournalist Leon Farrellof Rollingnews.ie, who took yesterday’s infamous Enda Kenny photo, said he set out to convey the circumstances the Taoiseach had found himself in in the wake of a poor Dáil performance earlier this week, the continuing fallout from the McCabe controversy, and the mounting pressure on his leadership.
The media had been told the Fine Gael leader wouldn’t be answering press questions – “and normally if there’s a doorstep you’d try and depict the situation via a particular expression or gesture”.
Watching the Taoiseach’s appearance at a jobs announcement in the city centre, he realised after a few minutes that Kenny’s position, just under the word ‘help’ in a display behind him was the photo to get.
There’s always competition with other photographers to get the ideal photo, Farrell said. In this case he was best positioned to capture the shot, and managed to time the photo perfectly to catch the Taoiseach with his eyes cast to the heavens.

Farrell is an agency photographer – meaning newspapers and web outlets likeTheJournal.iepay a subscription fee for use of photos. As a result, he said, “getting the front page is always the goal”.
Even so – a ‘treble’ is a very rare thing for an agency photographer. He’s been working since 1992, Farrell said, but this is the first time his photo has been selected by all three broadsheets.
SINN FÉIN PRESIDENT Gerry Adams has said he is worried of the catastrophic effect a hard border would have on the island and said he was concerned at claims the government is preparing for a return to the days of border controls.
Reports in yesterday’s Irish Examiner claimed that revenue officials had been meeting to determine all “legal and practical implications of a range of scenarios”.
Adams said: “This allegedly includes the examination and identification of locations for full border checkpoints with ‘red and green channel’ facilities in Louth, Monaghan, Cavan, Leitrim, and Donegal. It is also claimed that the M1 motorway between Dublin and Belfast is to be a particular focus for customs officials.”
Adams had used his Dáíl speaking time to ask the Taoiseach about the reports. Kenny responded by saying  he had seen reports drafted by customs officials but “I have an agreement with the British government that there will be no return to the border of the past and that means customs posts along the border”.
Kenny added that he and his party do not want to see a return to the old days and that “nobody north or south wants to a return to that”.
But Sinn Féín said it was not happy with that response and said it wanted clarity on what is to happen.
Adams, who is a TD for Louth, added: “The government urgently needs to clarify these contradictory positions. The people of Louth and the border community do not want a return of customs posts and checkpoints. Such a development would have serious economic consequences for jobs, the farming community, the fishing industry and local enterprises. Brexit is already hurting local businesses and this would make that situation worse.”
ENDA KENNY HAS been told that he must outline a timeline for his departure as party leader.
During a “subdued” parliamentary party meeting last night, both Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney, seen as the leading contenders to replace Kenny, told their party colleagues they needed to prepare for an early election.
It’s understood that Kenny may outline his plans at next week’s parliamentary party meeting on Wednesday.
The move comes after thegovernment survived a vote of confidencelast night. Kenny last night argued that “the last thing this country needs is a general election” and defended his record as Taoiseach.
However, Fine Gael deputies believe they cannot fight an election with Kenny as leader, with many stating toTheJournal.iethat there was a sense of panic within the party earlier this week that they could be 48 hours from a general election.
The call for the Taoiseach to be clear about his plans comes just days after Varadkar distanced himself from backbench TD Noel Rock’s call for Kenny to set out a timetable for his departure.
Speaking on RTÉ Radio One on Monday, Rock said:
“We know Enda Kenny has said he won’t be leading us into the election.
“Therefore there is a bit of a vacuum whenever people are asked in a poll who they will be voting for.
“They don’t know who they will be voting for if they vote for Fine Gael necessarily. So we need to clear that up sooner rather than later.”
During last night’s party meeting, Enda Kenny sat quietly as the party’s leading figures such as Paschal Donohoe outlined the need for the party to be proactive and prepare.
Overall, the party was described as “calm” with a sense the time had come for the party to brace for the future.
No movement
Parliamentary party chairman Martin Heydon toldRTÉ’s Morning Irelandthat, despite some calls, he does not expect there to be an early meeting to discuss the issue.
“At the minute the parliamentary party meets at 5.30pm on Wednesdays and I probably expect that to be the same next week.
“There was different views expressed at last week’s meeting as to when we’d meet again, but I’m in the hands of the members. I don’t really see the need for another meeting.”
Heydon said that the parliamentary party had discussed the no confidence motion and the issues surrounding Maurice McCabe’s treatment. He said that there was no in-depth discussion on elections or the party’s leadership.
“I can only deal with the facts as they are. This wasn’t an issue that was discussed at the meeting last night.”
He added that Kenny should be “given the space” to decide the timeline for his own departure.
Speaking to the same programme, vice chair Pat Deering said it was time the party had a “new focus”. However, he declined to explicitly say that if Kenny does not step aside he would move a motion of no confidence or who he would support.
Deputy party leader Senator James Reilly told RTÉ’s Sean O’Rourke programme today that as the longest serving TD in the Dáil, Enda Kenny’s mind is not consumed with reaching the history books as Fine Gael’s longest serving Taoiseach (John A. Costello currently holds the record).
So when?
Sources within the party indicate Kenny must give a timeline next week, and many expect it to be after the St Patrick’s Day trip to the White House.
“Let him go to the White House and when he gets back the wheels will be in motion,” said one party member.
While there has been speculation in the past that there could be a few Cabinet members interested in the job of Taoiseach, it really comes down to a two-horse race between Varadkar and Coveney.
Choosing the next leader of Fine Gael can take up to three weeks and includes votes from parliamentary party members, MEPs, and councillors.
“If we include the three-week contest after St Patrick’s Day, we are into April,” said one TD, who when asked if we would have a new Taoiseach by summer, said:
“Easter comes before summer, it will be then.”
However, one minister toldTheJournal.iethat timeline predictions are a lot shorter than expected in reality.

TAOISEACH ENDA KENNY has survived a vote of confidence in the government in the Dáil this evening.
With the support of the Independent Alliance, and Fianna Fáil abstaining, Fine Gael passed the motion with a vote of 57 to 52 in another fiery debate in the Dáil.
Setting out his stall, Taoiseach Enda Kenny said that “the last thing this country needs is a general election” and defended his record as Taoiseach.
Both Kenny and Fianna Fáil’s Micheál Martin accused Sinn Féin of opportunism, and drew comparisons with their actions in Northern Ireland to dissolve the Assembly.
Oireachtas TVOireachtas TV
Martin also accused Fine Gael ministers of “arrogance” and of manoeuvring while preparing for a post-Kenny party.
He was referring to reports that Ministers Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney had told party colleagues to prepare for an early election, and that a parliamentary party meeting had been called to discuss the issues.
Both are seen as potential future successors to Enda Kenny.
Martin said: “We do want a change of government, but we also believe that this Dáil has not yet fulfilled its obligations to the people who we are elected to serve.”
Gerry Adams said that we have a government “which has undermined confidence in itself”. He added: “Everything that’s gone wrong is your own fault” and that “citizens do not have confidence in this government.”
Minister Paschal Donohoe accused Sinn Féin of “debasing” the Dáil by bringing forward a motion of no confidence and said that they “feared progress”.
Labour leader Brendan Howlin criticised the government’s record in a number of areas, but especially in the differing accounts of Kenny on how much he knew and the contents of his meeting with Katherine Zappone.
Oireachtas TVOireachtas TV
He said: “Taoiseach, as I said at the outset – I have had no confidence in your Government since you formed it.
Howlin also made a pointed address to the Taoiseach’s potential successors.
He said:
“Some of them share that front row with you.”
AAA-PBP TD Paul Murphy said he had always had “zero confidence” in the government but said he had this opinion “crystalised this week”.
He said that Taoiseach tried to take people “for fools” in regards to his comments this week.
His colleague Ruth Coppinger claimed Kenny was dealing in “alternate facts”. Richard Boyd Barrett got quite heated, saying that there was no doubt that the smear campaign was orchestrated, and illustrative of a “rotten culture” in the State.
Oireachtas TVOireachtas TV
Boyd Barrett said that Garda commissioner Nóirín O’Sullivan should be removed from her position immediately, and accused the government of failing on a number of important issues.
Independents 4 Change TD Clare Daly said she didn’t really care about the motion, but urged the government to get this Tribunal set up quickly and “to get it right”. Mick Wallace echoed this sentiment, and called for the Tribunal to include other whistleblowers.
Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said that he had no confidence in the government, and said that the House needed to restore the public’s confidence.
Both Wallace and Ryan expressed reservations about the use of a Tribunal, given the time it would take and said it was essential to nail down the terms of reference quickly.
Sinn Féin’s Pearse Doherty accused the government of not acting on garda whistleblowers’ claims because of the smear campaigns conducted against them.
As a whole, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael TDs took their opportunities to sharply criticise Sinn Féin for bringing the motion in the first place, while other opposition members used the opportunity to criticise the government on a range of issues such as Irish Water, housing and the health service.
Things threatened to get out of hand several times, as Fine Gael Ministers rounded on Sinn Féin for their attitude to whistleblowers in the past.
After a debate which lasted almost four hours, the government eventually won out in the final vote.
It’s the day after what was possibly the worst day for this government. Taoiseach Enda Kenny is in the hot seat again and likely to face further questions about the McCabe Tusla file and what he did and did not know.
This is all before the government face a motion of no confidence later this evening. Things could get interesting… stay with us as we take you through Leaders’ Questions blow by blow.

However, it seemed to create more questions.
Here’s what you need to know (or don’t know):
Update 9.02 am
FIANNA FÁIL HAS described the government’s handling of the Maurice McCabe revelations as “incoherent and shambolic” but insisted that it will ensure the government survives.
Fianna Fáil’s health spokesperson Billy Kelleher made the comments on RTÉ’sMorning Irelandahead of today’s Dáil debate on a motion of confidence in the government.
The motion was tabled in response to a motion of no confidence in Enda Kenny tabled by Sinn Féin over the government’s handling of the controversy over an alleged smear campaign against Garda whistleblower Sergeant Maurice McCabe.
Fianna Fáil has said that it will abstain in the vote of no confidence with Kelleher saying that it’s about ensuring the country has a government.
“We will not be supporting the Sinn Fein motion, in other words we will not be bring down this government at this present time,” he said.
Despite this, Kelleher said that Fine Gael will have to “pull up their socks” due to what he described as its “incoherent and shambolic” response to the McCabe affair.
The TD added that the vote must also be seen in the context of Sinn Féin playing “no meaningful role” in ensuring a government was formed after last year’s general election.
Debate
The Dáil yesterday spent three hours hearing statements and asking questions on the issue. During that session, the Taoiseach said he gave inaccurate information in relation to a meeting Children’s Minister Katherine Zappone had with McCabe.
Kenny said that Zappone had not told him that she was going to meet with McCabe before their meeting.
Fianna Fáil spokesperson on health Billy Kelleher.Sam Boal / RollingNews.ieSam Boal / RollingNews.ie / RollingNews.ie
He had previously told RTÉ’s This Week on Sunday that Zappone had told him she would be meeting with McCabe. In response to a question from Fianna Fail leader Micheál Martin, he said:
“I might say mea culpa, because I am guilty here of not giving accurate information.
“I understood from thinking myself that she had asked me about meeting Sergeant McCabe in the first place.”
Tribunal
The government yesterday agreed to establish a tribunal of inquiry into the scandal. The terms of reference will be finalised over the coming weeks.
However, opposition members yesterday called for the tribunal to include other Garda whistleblowers.
Yesterday, whistleblower Keith Harrison demanded his case be included. In a statement issued through his solicitors yesterday afternoon, Harrison called for “truth and justice”.
Harrison claims that the incidents of alleged black propaganda contained in the protected disclosures of Superintendent David Taylor and McCabe are “not isolated”.
Speaking toRTÉ’s Prime Time last night, Fine Gael TD John Deasy claimed he had been approached in January 2014 by a senior garda, who made allegations against McCabe.
He said he believed there was a campaign against McCabe run by gardaí at a senior level.

THE GOVERNMENT IS nervous about extending the Tribunal to include other whistleblowers.
Yesterday,garda whistleblower Keith Harrison demanded his casebe included in the  Tribunal to be held into allegations that a smear campaign was waged against Maurice McCabe.
He also alleged that Tusla opened up an investigation into the wellbeing of his family after he raised issues within the police force.
In a statement issued through his solicitors yesterday, Harrison – whose story has been raised numerous times in the Dáil – called for “truth and justice”.
Children’s Minister Katherine Zappone last night agreed to Labour’s Alan Kelly’s request to meet with Harrison before the terms of reference are agreed.
Extending terms of reference
Calls to extend the terms of reference to include other whistleblowers – of which there are believed to be up to 10 at this stage – has been made by Labour and Independent 4 Change TDs, among others.
However, there were no discussions in yesterday’s tense Cabinet meeting about including this group.
It is understood that the feeling within government is that any broadening of the terms of reference of the Tribunal would lead to a significant lengthening of its timeline. Government sources say they are anxious to expedite outcomes in relation to McCabe’s case.
There are fears that including other cases in the Tribunal’s work would slow down the process and, ultimately, prove more costly.
While there was speculation that the Charlton Commission of Investigation (which will now not go ahead) would take up to nine months, there is no timeline for the suggested Tribunal.
There are also questions over who will chair the inquiry as Supreme Court justice Peter Charlton may not be able to commit to a longer time-frame which may be needed for a Tribunal (which are held in public, with powers to compel witnesses who have a right to legal representation).
Whileserious questions were askedof the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste yesterday about what they knew and when, the tenability of the Garda Commissioner Nóirin O’Sullivan’s position was also raised a number of times in the Dáil.
TD Mick Wallace, during his debate contribution, said:
Questions were also raised as to whether O’Sullivan will be able to discharge her functions at the top of the force while a possibly lengthy Tribunal takes place. Despite calls for her to step aside, without prejudice, while the investigation is ongoing, it is understood her job was also not discussed at Cabinet yesterday.
The Commissioner has refuted the claims made against her on numerous occasions. She maintains she was not privy nor would have condoned any smear campaign against any whistleblower.
With reporting by Sinéad O’Carroll
IN RESPONSE TO the growing controversy and scandal surrounding false allegations made against Garda whistleblower Maurice McCabe, the Dáil last night hosted ‘Statements of Clarification on Statements made by Taoiseach and Two Ministers’.
It was intended for Enda Kenny, Frances Fitzgerald and Katherine Zappone to clear up any remaining confusion over what they knew about the unfolding debacle, and when they knew it, and for other TDs to have their questions answered.
However, not everything was clarified. Here are the five most serious and significant questions that the government did not give a proper or sensible explanation for tonight.
1. When did Enda Kenny first hear about the false allegations against Maurice McCabe?
The Taoiseach was asked this question on several occasions last night, without giving a direct or specific answer to all but one of them – something that was not lost on opposition TDs.
Finally, he gave a response to Sinn Fein’s Maurice Quinlivan, claiming that he first became aware of the false allegations against Maurice McCabe, “When I watched the Prime Time programme last Thursday night”.
However,this contradicts the Taoiseach’s own remarks from earlier in the evening, when he confirmed thattwo days beforethe Prime Time broadcast, Katherine Zappone had told him that in her meeting with Maurice McCabe in January, she had discussed “false allegations of sexual abuse made against Maurice McCabe to Tusla”.
Furthermore,Labour leader Brendan Howlin hadraised those false allegationsduring a high-profile contribution to Leaders Questions,the day beforethe Prime Time broadcast.
Another Sinn Féin deputy, Jonathan O’Brien, followed up on these discrepancies, pointing out the fact that Howlin had raised the false allegations before the Prime Time broadcast.
The Taoiseach acknowledged this, even venturing to say “And I responded to Deputy Howlin”, which confirms the obvious – that he had heard the Labour leader’s contribution, which was addressed to the Taoiseach.
And yet, Kenny reiterated at the very end of the Dáil session that the first time he had heard of the false allegations against Maurice McCabe was during the Prime Time broadcast.
It remains to be seen how the Taoiseach can reconcile those seemingly irreconcilable facts.
2. What did Enda Kenny and Katherine Zappone discuss in their conversation before last Tuesday’s cabinet meeting?
In his opening remarks last evening, the Taoiseach stated that, in a meeting with Minister Zappone before last Tuesday’s cabinet meeting, she “did not divulge any of the details” about her meeting, in January, with Maurice McCabe.
However,this was contradicted by Katherine Zappone, who later told the Dáil that in her meeting with the Taoiseach last Tuesday, she told him that she and Maurice McCabe had discussed “false allegations of sexual abuse made against Maurice McCabe to Tusla”.
Unless the Taoiseach does not regard this as one of the “serious and disturbing issues that arose” at Zappone’s meeting with McCabe, his account of the Tuesday meeting is irreconcilable with Minister Zappone’s account of the Tuesday meeting.
In response to questioning from the AAA-PBP’s Paul Murphy, the Taoiseach reiterated that he “was not aware of any of the details of the discussion that Minister Zappone had with the McCabe family”.
Just seconds later, though, he added: “What Minister Zapponedidsay to me was that she had met the McCabes, and that they had discussed false allegations of sexual abuse that had been sent to Tusla”.
As you may have observed, this directly contradicts Kenny’s separate claim, made just seconds earlier, that he “was not aware of any of the details of the discussion that Minister Zappone had with the McCabe family”.
This is a contradiction that remains to be reconciled by the Taoiseach.
3. On what basis did Enda Kenny assure Katherine Zappone that allegations against Maurice McCabe would be included in the Commission of Inquiry?
This goes to the heart of the criticism faced by Katherine Zappone, after it emerged last week that, after her meeting with Maurice McCabe in January, she didn’t raise the issue of false allegations being made against him to Tusla, during last Tuesday’s cabinet meeting.
In her opening statement tonight, Katherine Zappone told the Dáil that in her meeting with the Taoiseach, before last Tuesday’s cabinet meeting:
Later on, in response to questioning by Ruth Coppinger, the Taoiseach said:
When pressed on whether he had indeed given Zappone an assurance that these matters would be included in the Commission of Inquiry, the Taoiseach confirmed this:
The Taoiseach went on to reiterate that Zappone had not told him “the detail of the discussion she had with the McCabes”.
As shown in the previous section, this claim is incompatible with the Taoiseach’s own description of what Zappone told him about her meeting with Maurice and Lorraine McCabe.
In any event, there is a major question mark over the Taoiseach’s claim that, on the one hand he was not aware of the details of the allegations against McCabe, and his assurance to Katherine Zappone that they would be covered by the terms of reference of the commission.
This is because theterms of reference of what was to be the Charleton Commission of Inquiryrelated exclusively to the alleged smear campaign against Maurice McCabe.
Therefore, as was pointed out by Today FM political correspondentGavanReilly, as well as AAA-PBP TD Mick Barry and Sinn Féin TD Pearse Doherty,it would have been impossible for the Taoiseach to assure Katherine Zappone that the false allegations against McCabe would be covered by the commission, unless he knew that those allegations were related to that alleged smear campaign.
And that would mean the Taoiseach was aware of greater detail about the false allegations against Maurice McCabe than he admitted tonight in the Dáil.
This is another inconsistency in the Taoiseach’s statements tonight.
4. Did Enda Kenny just make a “mistake” in saying he spoke to Katherine Zappone before her meeting with Maurice McCabe?
The Taoiseach had what he called a “mea culpa” in the Dáil at Leaders Questions, earlier today.
He admitted that, in an interview with RTE Radio One’s This Week on Sunday, he was “guilty of not giving accurate information” about a conversation he had supposedly had with Katherine Zappone,beforeher meeting with Maurice McCabe.
That conversation did not, in fact, take place.
During This Week on Sunday, host Colm O’Mongáin asked the Taoiseach: “What did Katherine Zappone tell you, and what did her officials tell your officials?”
The Taoiseach replied:
It’s noteworthy here than O’Mongáin, in his question, referred to ‘what her officials told your officials’.
Given that itwas, in fact, Zappone’s officials who notified Kenny’s officials in advance of the meeting, this would appear to have been a perfect cue for the Taoiseach to accurately describe what had happened.
But he did not do that.
And during tonight’s Dáil session, Kenny stated:
There is a serious question mark over the plausibility of Kenny’s claim that he was simply “mistaken” in his description of a conversation with Katherine Zappone, which he now admits never took place. There are specific, objective reasons for this.
Firstly, on Sunday he recounted specifically apersonal, one-one-one conversationwith Zappone before her meeting with McCabe, saying “I told her”.
Secondly, he recounted his (supposed)exact wordsto her, in a conversation which he now admits never took place, claiming he advised her: “If you do have a meeting, make sure you have a thorough account of it.”
As Labour leader Brendan Howlin put it, later in tonight’s session, “I can’t understand how you would have such flawed recollections of such significant meetings.”
The Taoiseach’s characterisation this evening, echoed by his Fine Gael colleague Bernard Durkan on tonight’s RTE Radio One Late Debate, that he simply did not have “the correct sequence” of events, is also implausible.
The implication here is that Kenny was, on Sunday, recalling the conversation he had with Zappone last Tuesday, but accidentally dating it to before her meeting with McCabe in January.
But remember what he recalled saying to her: “If you do have a meeting, make sure you have a thorough account of it.”
It is implausible in the extreme for the Taoiseach to have said this (advice about a potential, future meeting), during a conversation about a meeting, after it had already happened.
Kenny did not inaccurately recall what he said in a conversation with Katherine Zappone in January, nor did he mistakenly recall comments made to a third party as having been made to Zappone.
And he did not simply get the date of the conversation wrong.
He volunteered details, down to the exact wording of what he supposedly said to his Children’s Minister, in a conversation that never took place.
Unless they’re met with a sensible, logical and comprehensive explanation, these facts will continue to damage the Taoiseach’s credibility.
5. When did Frances Fitzgerald first learn that Tusla was involved in the Maurice McCabe case?
It is agreed by both Frances Fitzgerald and Fianna Fail Justice spokesperson Jim O’Callaghan that the two met in Leinster House on Wednesday evening.
They also agree that O’Callaghan notified the Tánaiste about a Prime Time documentary about the alleged smear campaign against Maurice McCabe, to be broadcast the following night.
They also agree that O’Callaghan wanted the Tánaiste to expand the Terms of Reference of what was then a Commission of Inquiry, to take into account what was to be included in the documentary.
However, the two disagree on whether O’Callaghan told Fitzgerald that the documentary involved Tusla, specifically.
Fitzgerald said tonight:
O’Callaghan responded:
So there is a direct and significant contradiction there between the Justice Minister and her opposite number in Fianna Fáil – one which is unlikely to be resolved independently.
Later in this evening’s Dáil session, the Tánaiste was asked when she first became aware that Tusla was involved in the Maurice McCabe case, first by Labour leader Brendan Howlin.
What’s notable about this is that the Tánaiste did not say that she was unaware ofanyTusla involvement in the Maurice McCabe case, before the Prime Time broadcast, but rather that she was unaware of specific details contained within the programme.
However, O’Callagan also asked if it was credible that a justice minister would agree to amend the terms of reference of a Commission of Investigation based on a television programme but wouldn’t even ask what that programme was about?
Updated 9.50pm
TAOISEACH ENDA KENNY has refuted the claim that he was made aware of the allegations of sexual abuse made against garda whistleblower Maurice McCabe before the airing of the RTÉ Prime Time programme last week.
Discussions continueduntil late this evening in the Dáil, and stayed fiery at times, as Kenny repeatedly said he did not know the information contained in the Tusla file on McCabe, and only became aware of their contents after the RTÉ programme.
The Tánaiste and Minister for Justice also said she was not aware of the allegations against Maurice McCabe, while Katherine Zappone appeared to corroborate the version of events which sees her telling Kenny she met the McCabes after the event.
When Gerry Adams asked the Taoiseach “when did [you] first become aware of this false allegation”, Kenny replied that he had answered the question before and that the question was “irrelevant to the central issue here” which was how to define and determine the truth surrounding the allegations of a smear campaign.
Kenny also sought to clarify the sequence of events regarding his meetings with Katherine Zappone, after an apparent contradiction in his account appeared earlier in the day.
Mea Culpa
Earlier, Kenny stated that he gave inaccurate information in relation Children’s Minister Katherine Zappone’s telling him she was going to meet with garda whistleblower Maurice McCabe.
Speaking today during Leaders’ Questions, Kenny said that Zappone had earlier not told him that she was going to meet with McCabe before their meeting, but that her office had contacted his office in relation to the meeting.
He had previously told RTÉ’s This Weekon Sunday that Zappone had told him she would be meeting with McCabe.
The Taoiseach told the programme that as “Minister Zappone, who is doing a very good job, was meeting Maurice McCabe in a private capacity I simply said ‘do make sure you have a very thorough account of it’”.
Speaking today in the Dáil. Kenny corrected that statement. In response to a question from Fianna Fail leader Micheál Martin, he said:
“I might say mea culpa, because I am guilty here of not giving accurate information.
“I understood from thinking myself that she had asked me about meeting Sergeant McCabe in the first place.
Kenny then said that Zappone “did not tell me herself that she was meeting Sergeant McCabe”, but that:
Zappone said yesterday that she had informed the Taoiseach about false Tusla allegations to do with McCabe before they were aired publicly on Prime Time last Thursday.
Contradiction
Despite owning up to making a mistake today, the Taoiseach later appeared to contradict himself about what he knew in relation to Tusla and McCabe. In response to a question from AAA-PBP leader Paul Murphy, he said:
“The Minister (Zappone) did not refer to any of the details of the discussion with the McCabes, the existence of a file in Tusla or the information contained in that file.
Murphy had previously said to Kenny that he was “well-known for having a casual relationship with the truth”.
He accused the Taoiseach of misleading the public.
“I mistakenly said…”
Speaking later on in the Dáil, Kenny sought to clarify his statements:
It was announced today that a Tribunal of Inquiry would be set up into whether there was an organised smear campaign against Garda McCabe by senior gardaí.
With reporting from Sean Murray
THE GOVERNMENT HAS agreed to set up a Tribunal of inquiry into allegations of a smear campaign against Maurice McCabe.
During Leaders’ Questions this afternoon, Kenny said the inquiry will find out the truth as to whether there was a smear campaign against garda whistleblower Sergeant Maurice McCabe.
What is a Tribunal?
Tribunals are set up to examine specific matters of urgent public importance. At its end, a report will be submitted to the Oireachtas – which may contain recommendations.
In many cases, a tribunal of inquiry will also give recommendations with a view to preventing the same problem happening again. It also has the power to include suggestions for law reform.
However, the tribunal’s function is purely investigative and fact-finding. Therefore, if the findings of a tribunal give rise to criminal investigation, the admissions made within cannot be used in evidence against a person in those proceedings.
As the Department of the Taoiseach states:
What is a Commission of Investigation?
Commissions of investigation are less expensive and a speedier method of investigating matters of public importance. They are also intended to be less adversarial.
They have become more popular in recent years as opposed to holding tribunals and are set up by a government order which must be approved by the Dáil and Seanad.
The terms of reference are set by the government or by an individual minister.
The commission makes a final report on its findings to that minister who is then obliged to publish the report. If the minister considers that publication would prejudice any criminal proceedings that are in progress, they can apply to the High Court for directions.
What have they been used for?
A Commission of Investigation was established to investigate the main causes of the banking crisis in 2010.
In 2006, a Commission of Investigation looked into the handling of complaints of child sexual abuse involving Catholic priests attached to the Archdiocese of Dublin and, in 2005, one was set up to investigate the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings.
Tribunals are something Ireland are extremely familiar with – namely how long and expensive they can be. RememberMahon? AndMoriarty? AndMorris?
This was originally meant to be a Commission of Investigation, right?
Correct.
So, why not now?
Sergeant Maurice McCabe released a statement yesterday evening calling for a full public inquiry into the allegations made against him, saying that “there is no reason to have any secret or private inquiry”.
Evidence in Commissions of Investigations is generally given in private – something that McCabe was opposed to.
Calling for the public inquiry and noting thatHealth Minister Simon Harrissaid that they were entitled to “truth and justice”, McCabe and his wife Lorraine believe they wouldn’t countenance having to wait 18 months for the findings of a private inquiry.
What powers does a Tribunal have?
Tribunals are vested with the powers, privileges and rights of the High Court.
Tribunals are usually chaired by judges or senior lawyers and they can make orders to force witnesses to attend and give evidence.
The High Court can order a witness to give evidence and hold them in contempt of court until they cooperate. It is a criminal offence to refuse to give evidence or to co-operate.
A tribunal can also order a person to pay the costs of another person appearing before the tribunal or the costs of the tribunal itself, if it considers that there is sufficient reason to do so.
This may happen if a person fails to co-operate with the tribunal or gives false or misleading evidence.
How much do they cost?
The duration and costs of tribunals have been seen as problematic. The tab is usually picked up by the State and can run into the millions.
The Mahon Tribunal, which was established in 1997 to investigate allegations of corrupt payments to politicians regarding political decisions around planning permissions and land rezoning, lasted 15 years and cost an estimated €200 million.
The Comptroller and Auditor Generalpublished a Special Report into Tribunals of Inquiryin December 2008 which gave an estimate of the costs involved in the more recent Mahon, Moriarty and Morris tribunals.
It stated, “Overall, the likely cost to the State of the three tribunals based on the pattern of costs experienced to date is estimated to be in the range of €336 million to €366 million.”
Critics of the process say that they are lengthy, costly and have no real power.
We know that the public inquiry will look at the central question, ‘Was there a deliberate smear campaign waged on Maurice McCabe?’
However, we don’t yet know the terms of reference, who will lead it and how long the tribunal will have to report back.
This evening, another garda whistleblower, Keith Harrison, demanded that his case be included in the upcoming tribunal.
THE MOOD WAS tense in the Dáil this afternoon, as Enda Kennyfaced questions from opposition TDsregarding the ongoing scandal related to the alleged smear campaign against garda whistleblower Maurice McCabe.
Kenny confirmed that a public Tribunal of Inquiry would be set up to delve into the case, but that wasn’t enough to satisfy many on the opposition benches with no details given on when it will begin, who it involve and what it’ll cost.
Things got heated between the Taoiseach and Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams, with Kenny calling Adams “a hypocrite” on two occasions.
Here’s how one of the exchanges went down:
Gerry Adams: “While your Government remains in office there will be no truth.  There will be no justice for Maurice McCabe and no resolution of the wider issues underpinning this shameful episode.  A criminal investigation is needed.
Enda Kenny: “You are an absolute hypocrite after what you did and what you said to former Senator Máiría Cahill.”

However, calling someone a hypocrite is one of things youcan’tdo in the Dáil chamber.

Re: Enda Kenny calling Gerry Adams a "hypocrite" earlier (twice) - that term is not allowed in the#Dáil, under Salient Rulings of the Chair
A little known document, called the “Salient Rulings of the Chair” offers a list of the range of thingsthat TDs cannot say in the Dáil chamber, both in general and to each other.
The document is intended to go hand-in-hand with the Dáil’s Standing Orders, which are essentially the rules of the house, to give a comprehensive picture of procedure and practice in the Dáil.
In other words, it’s a list of what you are and what you aren’t allowed say and do.
The document also details how a member of the Dáil must not allege that another member is guilty of a criminal or unlawful act or “reflect on his character or personal honour” by stating that the member is guilty of murder, blackmail, corruption, perjury, seditious libel, being deceitful or, strangely, “interfering in the distribution of land while a Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture”.
The document also contains a comprehensive list of “insulting and abusive expressions” that have been ruled disorderly when applied to a member, a member’s statement, or their actions or conduct.
TDs are also banned from saying that a colleague is ‘a smuggler’, ‘a rogue’, or ‘a scoundrel’.
These include:
Furthermore, at no point can the Dáil proceedings be referred to as a “circus”, “a farce” or “a slander machine”.
So, Kenny breached Dáil rules today by calling Adams a “hypocrite”,as well as making contradictory statementsregarding his meetings with Katherine Zappone to discuss the Children’s Minister’s meeting with Maurice McCabe.
With a Tribunal now on the way, the issue is sure to feature in the Dáil again and again over the next few weeks.
THE GOVERNMENT WILL establish a Tribunal of Inquiry into an alleged smear campaign against whistleblower Maurice McCabe.
Enda Kenny confirmed the public inquiry this afternoon following a meeting of Cabinet.
It will look at the central question:“Was there a deliberate smear campaign waged on Maurice McCabe?”
We’ll continue to bring you all the news from Leinster House and Garda HQ over the coming hours.
Stay with us.
Feb 14th 20171:23PMGood afternoon.There has been a flurry of meetings around Kildare Street this morning as the government scrambles a full response to allegations of a smear campaign against whistleblower Maurice McCabe by senior gardaí.Sinéad O’Carrollhere to take you through the next few hours, with news from our political reporterChristina Finnwho is embedded in Leinster House.Feb 14th 20171:25PMEnda Kenny is due in the Dáil for his usual Leaders’ Questions slot at 2pm.There, he will be quizzed by Micheál Martin (who he has already met today) and Gerry Adams, among others.However, there has already been a delay to the schedule with a Dáil Business Committee meeting postponed to 1.30pm because Cabinet are still meeting.Feb 14th 20171:28PMIt now seems definite that a public inquiry (also known by that dreaded term – Tribunal) will be held.It is what Maurice McCabe – the man at the centre of this entire scandal and the man who has suffered the most because of it – wants, and it is also what Opposition parties have called for.Kenny has little choice, it seems, but to grant their wishes.We asked our readers today what they would like to see happen – and the response has been an overwhelming agreement.Feb 14th 20171:33PMChristina has this synopsis from Kenny and Martin’s meeting this morning:A public inquiry expected to be accepted by Fine Gael. Fianna Fáil made it clear that one is needed and Martin made that point to the Taoiseach.Martin also met with Maurice McCabe and his wife last night and told the couple they would be calling for a public inquiry now.According to my sources, he also made the point to Kenny about how ‘dismally’ the government has handled this entire situation.The party has also submitted what it would like the terms of reference of any inquiry to be – but that doesn’t necessarily mean they will be used by the government.It is not clear if the terms will be widened to include other whistleblowers or if it will stick to the circumstances around the treatment of McCabe.Feb 14th 20171:43PMAs we entered into this week, a general election seemed likely but that threat now seems to have lessened.All ministers will emerge with their jobs in tact from today’s Cabinet meeting and Sinn Féin’s vote of no confidence should fail tomorrow.(There is also very, very little public appetite for heading back to the polls, as a Amárach/Claire Byrne Live poll for TheJournal.ie found yesterday.)McCabe’s statement yesterday did not call for heads to roll – but more for the truth over what he has endured over the past eight years to be put on public record as soon as possible. Here’s a key part of his statement – issued through solicitor’s yesterday.Feb 14th 20171:54PMWhat we know today…A public inquiry into how Maurice McCabe was treated after whistleblowing on a number of concerns about policing in his Cavan/Monaghan division will be established.The fall of the current government and subsequent general election seems unlikely at this point.Nobody’s position – either as a Minister or as a Garda Commissioner – is in immediate jeopardy.Another whistleblower,David Taylor, is back at work after being cleared of allegations of leaking information by the DPP and his suspension lifted.A statutory investigation into Tusla will be conducted by HIQA as a result of its creation and handling of a file about Maurice McCabe which contained false and erroneous allegations.Feb 14th 20171:57PMAfter Enda Kenny at 2pm, Children’s Minister Katherine Zappone will face questions from her Opposition colleagues. She’s probably not relishing the timing of that prospect.Feb 14th 20172:07PMThe Ceann Comhairle starts off the session in a light-hearted manner with a Valentine’s Day greeting after the usual prayer.Micheál Martin picks up and says he hopes there won’t be a massacre.We then get to the serious business…Martin begins, of course, with his meeting with Maurice and Lorraine McCabe last night. He talks about the ‘casual approach to a monumental false report’ by Tusla, that was ‘hanging around in garda stations without it being corrected’.He calls for apublic tribunal of inquiry.Feb 14th 20172:09PM“The kitchen sink thrown at them” by the garda’s legal team is how Martin describes how McCabe was treated at the private Commission of Investigation led by Kevin O’Higgins.In no way do they want to be involved in anything similar again, adds Martin.Feb 14th 20172:12PMEnda Kenny confirms that the government ‘agreed in principle’ to set up a Tribunal of Inquiry under the 1921 Act.“Was there an organised smear campaign against Garda McCabe by senior gardaí?” will be the central question.Feb 14th 20172:15PM“When we proceed down the road of having a tribunal of inquiry under 1921 act, we have to be very clear that it is right down the middle in respect of everybody,” Kenny said.He says it is very important that all main players go into the probe with a presumption of innocence.“People should be very careful with regard to this.”Feb 14th 20172:19PMEnda Kenny in a minor concession says:“I might say mea culpa here- I am guilty here of not giving accurate information,” he says in relation to who told him about Zappone’s meeting with McCabe.“I understood that she had asked me,” he continues, explaining it was her office who actually informed him.Feb 14th 20172:21PMAgain, speaking about Zappone’s meeting with McCabe, Kenny says that she did not “indicate details” of it with him.“Minister Zappone is clear that the discussions she had with McCabe were of a confidential nature. They were not in the public domain at the time.”Feb 14th 20172:25PMThe Taoiseach gets into argy-bargy with Gerry Adams, Kenny calls the Sinn Féin leader a ‘hypocrite’.He gets very animated in telling Adams that a number of people ‘vehemently’ deny that there was a smear campaign waged on McCabe. He says for this reason, it is imperative that the Tribunal was ‘set up in Cabinet’s wisdom’ to ensure it will be fair to everybody involved.Feb 14th 20172:31PMPaul Murphy:You’re well-known for having a casual relationship with the truth.The AAA-PBP TD says Kenny’s ‘mea culpa’ goes beyond what the Taoiseach has he has conceded.He claims that his original statement about Zappone’s meeting with McCabe was erroneous and misleading.He indicates his position as Taoiseach is untenable.“It matters.”Feb 14th 20172:34PMMurphy says that his party are in favour of a Tribunal but says that it is not necessary to have Maurice McCabe’s questions answered. Here are the questions, the McCabes want the truth about:Feb 14th 20172:36PMTo move away from Leinster House for a minute, Fine Gael’s Brian Hayes has given this interesting response toEuroParl radio.“What is behind this is bad practice, a culture of secrecy, a culture of looking after their own, I think the guards have to be held accountable for that and I think the wider issue now is the reforms that every government has spoke about in the last decade are so actually are put in place by the Commissioner to make sure the public confidence in the force remains,” he said.Clearly the government could have handled this an awful lot better but we’ve seen in Irish politics over the years these things happen and how governments respond often becomes a bigger story than actually the substance of the story itself.Feb 14th 20172:39PM“It’s not a case of a few bad apples… The barrell is evidently rotten,” continues Murphy in the Chamber about the gardaí.He says it is chilling what has been revealed in recent days.He is also concerned about the misinformation from government benches.“Facts are stubborn things. They can’t exist in two different states at the same time,” he notes, citing the different stories from Zappone and Kenny about her meeting with McCabe and Jim O’Callaghan and the Tánaiste’s recollections of a conversation about the same issue.Feb 14th 20172:41PMMick Wallace is up now.He says a criminal investigation must run in parallel with the Tribunal, led by external investigators from outside the country.“A lot of bad things have happened,” he notes.Asking about Nóirín O’Sullivan’s presumption of innocence, he says that Maurice McCabe was treated as ‘guilty’ for years.“Are they all liars?” he asks of a list of whistleblowers which includes McCabe, Keith Harrison and Nick Keogh.If she genuinely didn’t know how whistleblowers were treated, she’s not fit for the job anyway if she didn’t know what was going on in the force.Feb 14th 20172:46PMWallace decides to quote whistleblower David Taylor, a former press officer in An Garda Síochána who said:Everybody in headquarters knew about the campaign against Maurice McCabe.He also reiterates the story of Taylor telling both former Commissioner Martin Callinan and O’Sullivan about the journalist who had a ‘damaging’ story about McCabe after visiting the family allegedly at the centre of the false accusation of sex abuse.He said that Callinan texted Taylor back after he told him the news. Wallace says O’Sullivan ‘rang him for a good chat’.Feb 14th 20172:50PMLeaders’ Questions concludes with the Taoiseach calling for support for the Tribunal of Inquiry.Feb 14th 20172:51PMThere are still a lot of unknowns about the Tribunal – who, when, how much, how long are all pertinent questions right now.Fianna Fáil already has its demands about terms of reference, and Fine Gael seem concerned that a presumption of innocence will be central to its ethos.We’ll continue to bring you reaction and details as we get them.Feb 14th 20173:02PMTwo people that Enda says ‘vehemently deny’ there was an organised smear campaign against Maurice McCabe and who will be central to any Tribunal will be current garda commissioner Nóirín O’Sullivan and her predecessor Martin Callinan.Who is Noirin O’Sullivan?Here’s a profile from 2014, when she took on the jobFeb 14th 20173:17PMIreland is *very* familiar with Tribunals (how do you respond to the words Mahon and Moriarty?) but here’s a rundown of what powers they have:According to the Taoiseach’s Department:The main difference between a Parliamentary Inquiry (non-statutory) and a Tribunal of Inquiry is that non-statutory inquiries are not vested with the powers, privileges and rights of the High Court; Tribunals of Inquiry are.They are established by the Oireachtas to examine ”matters of urgent public importance”.They do not administer justice.Their work is solely inquisitorial.Tribunals are obliged to report their findings to the Oireachtas.They have the power to enforce the attendance and examination of witnesses and the production of documents relevant to the work in hand.Sittings are usually public but can, at the Tribunal’s discretion, be held privately.Feb 14th 20173:21PMSo, after a bit of kerfuffle in the chamber about the order of business, it looks like Zappone will take questions as planned at 3.45pm.According to our reporter Christina Finn, there may also be statements from the Taoiseach and Tánaiste later.Feb 14th 20173:26PMBREAKING:Whistleblower Keith Harrison has issued a statement through his solicitor to “demand” that his case is included in any inquiry to be held by the “political establishment”.More to follow…Feb 14th 20174:19PMWe’ll have more on this a bit later…Re: Enda Kenny calling Gerry Adams a "hypocrite" earlier (twice) - that term is not allowed in the#Dáil, under Salient Rulings of the Chair— Dan Mac Guill (@danmacg)February 14, 2017Dan Mac Guill/ Twitter
Good afternoon.
There has been a flurry of meetings around Kildare Street this morning as the government scrambles a full response to allegations of a smear campaign against whistleblower Maurice McCabe by senior gardaí.
Sinéad O’Carrollhere to take you through the next few hours, with news from our political reporterChristina Finnwho is embedded in Leinster House.
Enda Kenny is due in the Dáil for his usual Leaders’ Questions slot at 2pm.

There, he will be quizzed by Micheál Martin (who he has already met today) and Gerry Adams, among others.
However, there has already been a delay to the schedule with a Dáil Business Committee meeting postponed to 1.30pm because Cabinet are still meeting.
It now seems definite that a public inquiry (also known by that dreaded term – Tribunal) will be held.
It is what Maurice McCabe – the man at the centre of this entire scandal and the man who has suffered the most because of it – wants, and it is also what Opposition parties have called for.
Kenny has little choice, it seems, but to grant their wishes.
We asked our readers today what they would like to see happen – and the response has been an overwhelming agreement.

Christina has this synopsis from Kenny and Martin’s meeting this morning:
A public inquiry expected to be accepted by Fine Gael. Fianna Fáil made it clear that one is needed and Martin made that point to the Taoiseach.
Martin also met with Maurice McCabe and his wife last night and told the couple they would be calling for a public inquiry now.
According to my sources, he also made the point to Kenny about how ‘dismally’ the government has handled this entire situation.
The party has also submitted what it would like the terms of reference of any inquiry to be – but that doesn’t necessarily mean they will be used by the government.
It is not clear if the terms will be widened to include other whistleblowers or if it will stick to the circumstances around the treatment of McCabe.
As we entered into this week, a general election seemed likely but that threat now seems to have lessened.
All ministers will emerge with their jobs in tact from today’s Cabinet meeting and Sinn Féin’s vote of no confidence should fail tomorrow.
(There is also very, very little public appetite for heading back to the polls, as a Amárach/Claire Byrne Live poll for TheJournal.ie found yesterday.)
McCabe’s statement yesterday did not call for heads to roll – but more for the truth over what he has endured over the past eight years to be put on public record as soon as possible. Here’s a key part of his statement – issued through solicitor’s yesterday.

What we know today…

After Enda Kenny at 2pm, Children’s Minister Katherine Zappone will face questions from her Opposition colleagues. She’s probably not relishing the timing of that prospect.
The Ceann Comhairle starts off the session in a light-hearted manner with a Valentine’s Day greeting after the usual prayer.
Micheál Martin picks up and says he hopes there won’t be a massacre.
We then get to the serious business…
Martin begins, of course, with his meeting with Maurice and Lorraine McCabe last night. He talks about the ‘casual approach to a monumental false report’ by Tusla, that was ‘hanging around in garda stations without it being corrected’.
He calls for apublic tribunal of inquiry.
“The kitchen sink thrown at them” by the garda’s legal team is how Martin describes how McCabe was treated at the private Commission of Investigation led by Kevin O’Higgins.
In no way do they want to be involved in anything similar again, adds Martin.
Enda Kenny confirms that the government ‘agreed in principle’ to set up a Tribunal of Inquiry under the 1921 Act.
“Was there an organised smear campaign against Garda McCabe by senior gardaí?” will be the central question.
“When we proceed down the road of having a tribunal of inquiry under 1921 act, we have to be very clear that it is right down the middle in respect of everybody,” Kenny said.
He says it is very important that all main players go into the probe with a presumption of innocence.
“People should be very careful with regard to this.”
Enda Kenny in a minor concession says:
“I might say mea culpa here- I am guilty here of not giving accurate information,” he says in relation to who told him about Zappone’s meeting with McCabe.
“I understood that she had asked me,” he continues, explaining it was her office who actually informed him.
Again, speaking about Zappone’s meeting with McCabe, Kenny says that she did not “indicate details” of it with him.
“Minister Zappone is clear that the discussions she had with McCabe were of a confidential nature. They were not in the public domain at the time.”

The Taoiseach gets into argy-bargy with Gerry Adams, Kenny calls the Sinn Féin leader a ‘hypocrite’.
He gets very animated in telling Adams that a number of people ‘vehemently’ deny that there was a smear campaign waged on McCabe. He says for this reason, it is imperative that the Tribunal was ‘set up in Cabinet’s wisdom’ to ensure it will be fair to everybody involved.
Paul Murphy:
You’re well-known for having a casual relationship with the truth.
The AAA-PBP TD says Kenny’s ‘mea culpa’ goes beyond what the Taoiseach has he has conceded.
He claims that his original statement about Zappone’s meeting with McCabe was erroneous and misleading.
He indicates his position as Taoiseach is untenable.
“It matters.”
Murphy says that his party are in favour of a Tribunal but says that it is not necessary to have Maurice McCabe’s questions answered. Here are the questions, the McCabes want the truth about:

To move away from Leinster House for a minute, Fine Gael’s Brian Hayes has given this interesting response toEuroParl radio.
“What is behind this is bad practice, a culture of secrecy, a culture of looking after their own, I think the guards have to be held accountable for that and I think the wider issue now is the reforms that every government has spoke about in the last decade are so actually are put in place by the Commissioner to make sure the public confidence in the force remains,” he said.
Clearly the government could have handled this an awful lot better but we’ve seen in Irish politics over the years these things happen and how governments respond often becomes a bigger story than actually the substance of the story itself.
“It’s not a case of a few bad apples… The barrell is evidently rotten,” continues Murphy in the Chamber about the gardaí.
He says it is chilling what has been revealed in recent days.
He is also concerned about the misinformation from government benches.
“Facts are stubborn things. They can’t exist in two different states at the same time,” he notes, citing the different stories from Zappone and Kenny about her meeting with McCabe and Jim O’Callaghan and the Tánaiste’s recollections of a conversation about the same issue.
Mick Wallace is up now.
He says a criminal investigation must run in parallel with the Tribunal, led by external investigators from outside the country.
“A lot of bad things have happened,” he notes.
Asking about Nóirín O’Sullivan’s presumption of innocence, he says that Maurice McCabe was treated as ‘guilty’ for years.
“Are they all liars?” he asks of a list of whistleblowers which includes McCabe, Keith Harrison and Nick Keogh.
If she genuinely didn’t know how whistleblowers were treated, she’s not fit for the job anyway if she didn’t know what was going on in the force.

Wallace decides to quote whistleblower David Taylor, a former press officer in An Garda Síochána who said:
Everybody in headquarters knew about the campaign against Maurice McCabe.
He also reiterates the story of Taylor telling both former Commissioner Martin Callinan and O’Sullivan about the journalist who had a ‘damaging’ story about McCabe after visiting the family allegedly at the centre of the false accusation of sex abuse.
He said that Callinan texted Taylor back after he told him the news. Wallace says O’Sullivan ‘rang him for a good chat’.
Leaders’ Questions concludes with the Taoiseach calling for support for the Tribunal of Inquiry.
There are still a lot of unknowns about the Tribunal – who, when, how much, how long are all pertinent questions right now.
Fianna Fáil already has its demands about terms of reference, and Fine Gael seem concerned that a presumption of innocence will be central to its ethos.
We’ll continue to bring you reaction and details as we get them.
Two people that Enda says ‘vehemently deny’ there was an organised smear campaign against Maurice McCabe and who will be central to any Tribunal will be current garda commissioner Nóirín O’Sullivan and her predecessor Martin Callinan.
Ireland is *very* familiar with Tribunals (how do you respond to the words Mahon and Moriarty?) but here’s a rundown of what powers they have:
According to the Taoiseach’s Department:
So, after a bit of kerfuffle in the chamber about the order of business, it looks like Zappone will take questions as planned at 3.45pm.
According to our reporter Christina Finn, there may also be statements from the Taoiseach and Tánaiste later.
BREAKING:
Whistleblower Keith Harrison has issued a statement through his solicitor to “demand” that his case is included in any inquiry to be held by the “political establishment”.
More to follow…
We’ll have more on this a bit later…

TAOISEACH ENDA KENNY was in Corklast night speaking at the Forum on Brexit.
Local stand up comedian and prankster Ross Browne saw this as a prime opportunity to pull off a gag.

Taking his place at the front of the room, Browne lasted a whole minute before anyone actually approached him to stop – with a man eventually emerging from the audience to have a word with him.

TAOISEACH ENDA KENNY has said that he would consider holding a public inquiry into allegations of a smear campaign against garda whistleblower Maurice McCabe, and that he would discuss the matter with Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin tomorrow morning.
He told RTÉ News that he would try and see “the most effective way at finding the truth here”
It is believed that Martin was meeting McCabe, himself, this evening amid political pressure on the government to hold an inquiry in public after a statement issued by McCabe this afternoon.https://www.facebook.com/rtenews/videos/1574733789222284/
In a statement released this afternoon, Maurice McCabe has called for a full public inquiry into the allegations made against him, saying that “there is no reason to have any secret or private inquiry”.
In a joint statement with his wife, Lorraine, McCabe said that they have endured “eight years of great suffering, private nightmare, public defamation and state vilification” after he had brought public attention to issues within An Garda Síochana.
Speaking earlier today, the Taoiseach reinforced that a commission of investigation would set out to establish the truth as quickly as possibly.
The couple said, althoughHealth Minister Simon Harrissaid that they were entitled to “truth and justice”, that they wouldn’t get that if they had to wait 18 months for the findings of a private inquiry.
They reference that state investigations, such as the O’Higgins Commission and internal Garda investigations, were all conducted in private and say that the public “has little or no appreciation of what was done, and attempted to be done, to Maurice in the course of its hearings”.
They say that the allegation made of sexual abuse in 2006 against Maurice, “against the background of the current Tusla controversy”, was attempted to be used during the O’Higgins Commission as part of “repeated attempts” to discredit “his motives and testimony”.
The McCabes call for a number of questions to be answered in the course of a public inquiry.
They include if senior gardaí were formally or informally notified of the alleged sexual abuse case against McCabe, which gardaí were involved in the claim, and why McCabe was not informed of these allegations in 2013.
The pair add:
The McCabes say that the answer to these questions could be given now and put in the public domain without prejudicing any future public inquiry.
They say that if these questions were answered now, “the public will be in a position to know who to believe”.
Fianna Fáil justice spokesperson Jim O’Callaghan issued a statement this evening backing McCabe’s call for a public inquiry.
He said: “Fianna Fáil has long maintained that the response to this issue must have the full support of the McCabe family.
Labour leader Brendan Howlin also supported the call for a public inquiry.
Catch up on how this story has developed today, with developments from Katherine Zappone, Garda Commissioner Nóirín O’Sullivan and Tusla:
SIX MINISTERS AND three junior ministers have admitted to using their private email addresses to send government information, but all claim no “sensitive” information was sent unsecurely.
Tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald, Housing Minister Simon Coveney, Minister for Education Richard Bruton and Minister for Health Simon Harris have all used their personal email accounts for official work. Ministers Michael Creed and Heather Humphreys also outlined they have in the past used their unsecure private email accounts to send official government information.
Email security specialist and consultant Brian Honan said government departments need to be “aware of the risks posed by staff using their personal email for official work”. If any official information is sent through personal gmail accounts then the department “can no longer guarantee the appropriate security and privacy controls are in place to protect that data” Honan outlined.
Honan continued to say that government departments are required by law under various acts and regulations like the Data Protection Act to ensure they keep data and information they send “secure at all times”.
Honan has previously worked with the Irish government on information security, and said a set policy was needed to better lay out “the rules and framework for the acceptable usage of email” for official work.
‘Non-sensitive official information’
Housing Minister Simon Coveney said he has used his private email account for “communications on certain matters, such as diary issues, speeches and information updates, but generally not for the purposes of confidential official business”.
Richard Bruton, the Minister for Education said he has used his personal email account to receive “non-sensitive official information” on occasion. “Material was usually sent to my personal email where I was not accompanied by a member of staff, and where there was an urgent need to communicate information to me, often in advance of media appearances,” Minister Bruton explained.
The disclosures from the senior cabinet members follow a series of parliamentary questions put to every minister by Fianna Fáil TD Michael McGrath.
Before Christmas,Taoiseach Enda Kenny told the Dáilthat on occasion he has used his personal email account for official business, and that he was aware of the security risk involved.
He said:
He had been asked by Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, while Sinn Féin’s Gerry Adams and Labour’s Brendan Howlin also voiced their concerns about private email usage. Their comments came in the wake of news about Russian hackers accessing accounts connected to the USA’s Democratic and Republican parties.
Minister for Health Simon Harris also said in reply to McGrath that he has “on rare occasions” used his gmail account to send and receive government information. The Wicklow TD argued that “while a review is underway, there is currently no policy preventing members of Government using personal accounts”.
Tánaiste and Justice Minister Frances Fitzgerald outlined that like most people she has a personal email address. The minister revealed she has on “very rare occasions, used this address in relation to my role”.
McGrath toldTheJournal.iethat the ministers “are potentially leaving themselves open to having sensitive government information stolen and used inappropriately”.
“In recent weeks and months, we have seen widespread attempts at hacking various European governments. The Irish government cannot leave itself open to attack,” Deputy McGrath warned.
Ministers all have an official department email account they are advised to use for sending information on any government work, as the accounts are encrypted. This essentially means there’s a layer of security that would help block any attempted hack.
Private accounts are not encrypted and as such are more vulnerable to hacking attempts from outside parties.
Heather Humphreys, who is Minister for Arts and the Gaeltacht said that she does “make use of a private gmail account” for work. She explained that she uses her personal account on her mobile phone “to forward information of a non-sensitive nature to my private office, generally relating to diary appointments or constituency matters”.
Michael Creed, the government Minister for Agriculture said he does use a “personal gmail account for official correspondence that is non-sensitive”.
Fianna Fáil TD Michael McGrath stated that “the Taoiseach should now direct all government ministers to use their departmental or Oireachtas emails for government business”.
Under review
A government spokesperson confirmed that “there is currently no policy preventing members of government from using personal accounts for official business”. But continued to outline that this situation is “currently under review”.
Three junior ministers, Eoghan Murphy, Patrick O’Donovan, and Séan Kyne also admitted to using their unsecured personal emails to send official information.
The junior minister for public expenditure Eoghan Murphy, who used his personal account for what was described as “transactional purposes” of information has recently “put in place arrangements for this to cease” his department stated.

FIANNA FÁIL IS to abstain in next week’s vote of no confidence in the government, meaning the motion will almost certainly be defeated.
The decision will be formally ratified by the party at its meeting on Tuesday before the vote, sources within the party said this evening.
Supporting, or not voting against, Fine Gael in such circumstances is part of the confidence and supply agreement between the two parties in order to support the current minority government.
However, this evening a clear division between the two parties has emerged as to whether or not Justice Minister Frances Fitzgerald knew about the issues between Tusla and whistleblower Garda Maurice McCabe before last Thursday’s Prime Time broadcast.
Earlier Micheal Martin told RTÉ that the party’s spokesman on justice Jim O’Callaghan met with Frances Fitzgerald last Wednesday evening to discuss the Charleton Commission of Investigation and raised the Tusla story.

This evening Fitzgerald said in a statement:
‘Private capacity’
Meanwhile, Taoiseach Enda Kenny has clarified that when he said Minister for Children Katherine Zappone was meeting Maurice McCabe “in a private capacity”, he meant that the meeting was “confidential”.
A Government spokesperson this evening said that “Minister Zappone met Garda McCabe confidentially on Tusla-related, highly sensitive issues – that is what the Taoiseach means when he says ‘in a private capacity’”.
Earlier the Taoiseach said that he knew that Minister for Children Katherine Zappone was meeting Sergeant Maurice McCabe in late January but didn’t ask what the meeting was about.
Speaking toRTÉ Radio’s This Week, The Taoiseach said that as “Minister Zappone, who is doing a very good job, was meeting Maurice McCabe in a private capacity I simply said ‘do make sure you have a very thorough account of it’”.
When asked again if he had known what was the context of the McCabe – Zappone meeting, the Taoiseach replied once more: “No, as she was meeting him in a private capacity”.
“Cabinet dealt with the terms of reference (of the coming Charleton Commission of Investigation into the alleged smear campaign against McCabe) and Minister Zappone has made it clear that the terms of reference covered the things she was discussing (with McCabe),” the Taoiseach said.

He added that after the broadcast of last Thursday’s Prime Time programme regarding the ongoing Tusla saga, Minister for Justice Frances Fitzgerald said “she had no problem having Tusla added to the terms of reference”.
When asked about the13 letters sent by a whistleblower to Frances Fitzgeraldlate last year, as raised by Labour’s Alan Kelly earlier this afternoon, the Taoiseach said “I don’t have the details of those investigations”.
Criminal investigation?
Kenny was more forthcoming on the possibility of a full criminal investigation into the Tusla saga, as opposed to the Charleton investigation which has no formal powers.
“The central issue is to find out was there or was not a scheme against (McCabe) based on erroneous allegations of sexual misconduct,” he said.

Asked directly if he isn’t accepting calls for a criminal investigation at present, the Taoiseach said:
“I’m not ruling it out either.”
