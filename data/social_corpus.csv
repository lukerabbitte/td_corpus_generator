Im by no means a Fianna Fail supporter, but it seems to me the only thing Enda Kenny is good for is moaning about the oppositions failures. I really believe they would be just as much a disaster as FF."

So, if Enda Kenny did become Taoiseach tomorrow what would change in this country? What would he differently to Brian Cowen to bring Ireland out of recession? Would it all just suddenly change? like some people think it will."
