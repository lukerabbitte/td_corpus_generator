Richard Boyd Barrett	57	PBP	Dublin	#RichardBoydBarrett	2024-02-15	dail	33	Sports Funding	dbsect_7	The need for radical reform in RTÉ is obvious from the €450,000 paid to the former financial officer. It is shocking on top of all the revelations about obscene salaries. We need to get to the root of why this stuff happened. Part of the reason was that RTÉ moved away from a public service remit and became too embroiled in advertising and commercial considerations. Then all the executives thought they had to be paid the same as those who work in the corporate sector, abandoning their public service remit. To resolve the matter, we need, as well as reform at the top, direct Exchequer funding that is not reliant on commercial sponsorship. How do we pay for that? We have been arguing for months that a tax should be put on the profits of social media companies. This could easily fund RTÉ through direct Exchequer funding. It would give us additional money for public service broadcasting. The ordinary workers, including crew and others, should not pay the price - nor should the public in terms of the quality of public service broadcasting - for the crimes of a few at the top of RTÉ.	spk_69

It is currently a sustainable shellfish industry which they estimate directly and indirectly results in the employment of approximately 800 people affecting towns and coastal communities and fishers all the way up and down the east coast. The threat they see is from plans to build industrial wind farms on sensitive sand banks. Sand banks particularly close to me are the Kish Bank and the Codling Bank. Fishers and myself would very much advocate in favour of developing renewable energy resources and using the marine potential we have to develop those resources and nobody disputes this. However, we do not think one thing should come at the expense of another. In fact the point the fishers on the east coast make is that European law - I am not a legal expert in this area - is very clear that we cannot displace one industry with another. Where there is an industry and where people are making their livelihood and living in a particular area it is prohibited to displace them and destroy their industry and livelihood in order to make way for another industry. That is precisely what they see as coming down the line as the private corporations - they are all private corporations, most of them not even companies based in this country - are planning to put very big industrial wind farms all the way up and down the east coast on sensitive sand banks which are critical to the sustainability of the shellfish industry and fish spawning grounds. They are very sensitive sites at many levels. The Minister's concern, and the fisher's concern, is in terms of the fishing but the sites are also very sensitive environmentally. The fishers say that the private companies that are being issued licenses, for example at the moment for surveys, are ultimately intending to put big industrial wind farms which will potentially see thousands of enormous wind turbines at very close proximity to our coasts and critically, from the fishers' point of view, on sand banks. The sand banks are critical to the fishers' industry and this will destroy their industry. They are in no doubt of that and that there will be nothing left of their industry at the end of it. These things should be placed further out or on less sensitive sites. If the wind farms go on these sand banks, like the Codling, Kish and others, they will destroy their fishing industry and their livelihoods. There is supposed to be a requirement for serious consultation between developers in these areas and those who make a living - in this case the fishers - but this is not happening. In the case of the developers on the Codling Bank they will not even meet the legal representatives of the fishers. There is no serious engagement and developers are ploughing ahead regardless of the consequences for the fishers. The question the fishers asked me to ask the Minister is what he is doing to safeguard their industry and their livelihoods. They are watching in and are very keen to hear the Minister's response but that is what they want to know. What is the Minister doing to ensure their industry and livelihoods are not destroyed by plans to put wind turbines on these particular locations which are critical to the sustainability of their industry, their incomes and their jobs ?	spk_348
Richard Boyd Barrett	57	PBP	Dublin	#RichardBoydBarrett	2024-02-15	dail	33	Sustainable Fisheries Sector and Coastal Communities: Statements, Questions and Answers	dbsect_30	I will add that the fishers would very much appreciate, given the complaints they are making about the failure of these companies to engage properly with their representatives, particularly in terms of the Codling Bank, that the Minister might look into that and try to ensure that engagement actually takes place and that we do not end up cutting off our nose to spite our face.There is no reason, with floating offshore wind, we cannot put these in different locations now. We have the technology. There does not have to be a trade-off between the imperative of developing renewable energy resources and destroying existing livelihoods in industries or, for that matter, doing other things that may damage our marine and coastal environment. I hope the Minister will look into that east coast side of things because the fishers would very much appreciate it.	spk_350
Richard Boyd Barrett	57	PBP	Dublin	#RichardBoydBarrett	2024-02-14	dail	33	Business Costs for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises: Motion [Private Members]	dbsect_8	I thank the Regional Group for bringing forward the motion to discuss SMEs and the supports they need. The first thing I want to do is to advocate on behalf of the 26,000 small enterprises who are the taxi drivers of this country. They are very concerned, at the moment, about moves to deregulate the taxi industry that are being spearheaded by some other SMEs that - do not get me wrong - have a legitimate concern, specifically those in the pub trade, restaurants, night entertainment and so on, who have teamed up with Uber and some of these other ride-hailing app people to argue that there is a chronic shortage of taxis and that effectively we need to introduce the Uber-type model for taxis, where anybody can be a taxi driver and where there is complete deregulation. The taxi drivers - 26,000 of them and their families - are very concerned. I agree with them that this is not the way to go. First, huge numbers of those taxi drivers have invested large amounts of money in buying new taxis, often electric vehicles, and they have big loans with the banks. If there is wholesale deregulation of the taxi industry, that will seriously impact on their ability to make a living and, therefore, their ability to pay back loans, which are very large loans in many cases, for expensive new taxis. We should not go down that road. Linked to that, we should also not lower the entry requirements for going into the taxi industry because when people get into a taxi, they need to know they are going to be safe. They need to know they are in a properly regulated taxi with somebody who knows the business, knows the area and is not just somebody who can put themselves on an Uber app with the potential danger that they do not really know who is driving them and so on. That is important. The taxi drivers would say that some of the figures being put out by Uber and some of the others about the chronic shortage taxis are inaccurate. Apparently, FREENOW has very different figures on the availability of taxis. It is certainly the case that at certain times we see long lines of taxis waiting long periods to pick up a fare. The taxi drivers admit that there are pinch points at particular times of the day, or particularly at night. How do we address that? It is unfair to put the burden of solving that problem solely on the shoulders of taxi drivers. We need more frequent or expanded public transport and bus services at night, which can help the small businesses that depend on night time trade but not put an excessive burden on taxi drivers to fill a gap in the provision of late night transport. The other thing is that taxi drivers will point out their safety concerns. Many taxi drivers do not like driving at night because they are worried about their personal safety. It is up to the Government to address those safety concerns but deregulating the taxi industry is not is not the way forward. Critically, the Government, the National Transport Authority and anybody who is looking at this issue needs to engage with the taxi drivers and treat them with respect. The last time we had deregulation of the taxi industry, it was a total disaster for taxi drivers and it should not happen again.  The second group I want to advocate for consists of our many actors, musicians, performers, dancers, writers and directors, of which there are tens of thousands, who have helped contribute to the culture and music of this country - things we often take for granted. They are mostly sole traders. They have a very precarious existence, going from gig to gig, and very a poor income in many cases. Most of our artists and the people who contribute to the films that we see on television or who work in music live in poverty and in very precarious circumstances. They need more support. I believe that the basic income for artists should be extended to all those who work in the in the arts. It is also critically important that the Government addresses the copyright issue in terms of intellectual property rights and royalties - in other words, for writers, directors, actors and so on who are being robbed of the royalties they should get for their performances. They get paid for making a television programme or whatever but then the producers run off of the royalties when the same thing is distributed on Netflix or whatever it is, and they are not getting paid. That is a breach of the copyright directive. The use of buy-out contracts being enforced on writers, directors and performers by producer companies has to stop. It is contrary to the copyright directive, it is contrary to the law and it is an abuse and exploitation of our writers, actors, performers, dancers, musicians, composers and so on. I ask the Government to seriously examine that. Generally, there are some people who rightly want to be small businesses, loan traders and so on. There are other people who are wrongly classified as those things because it suits their employers not to give them proper jobs. That is widespread in a whole number of industries. The arts is another area where it is widespread. If you want to be a small business, that is fine, but if you are actually an employee who is clocking in from nine to five and working from the same person again and again, even if it is episodic or in the gig economy, you should be classified as an employee so that you get your holiday entitlements, sick pay, pension rights and so on and so forth. My last point is on the generality of SMEs. When small and medium enterprise owners come to me, their concern is rates. It is one of the big concerns. It is not fair that a small café pays the same rates, per square metre of the business, as a bank that is making billions of euro in profits. We should have a differential scheme of rates based on revenue and profits, and not one whereby the butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker are paying the same level of rates as huge chains and banks that are making enormous profits. I also believe that we need a not-for-profit insurance company that provides insurance that is actually affordable for small and medium enterprises. Finally, we have to do something about massive rent increases for small businesses that can often put them out of business at a stroke. 	spk_57
Richard Boyd Barrett	57	PBP	Dublin	#RichardBoydBarrett	2024-02-14	dail	33	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_14	I have a fundamental problem with the World Economic Forum as a gathering where the world's most profitable and richest companies and billionaires rub shoulders with politicians from around the world, primarily to pursue their own interests rather than the wider interests of society. One thing of interest I notice was that Hines, the wealth and asset management company and owner of a very significant amount of property in this country, was present in Davos this year. That is very telling. The biggest residential development in the country, the Cherrywood development in my own area, is owned by Hines, although it has flipped some of the property and made a lot of profit. It got the land from NAMA at a discount but very modest houses there are going for between €600,000 and €700,000 and rents are running at €2,500 to €3,000 a month. This is totally unaffordable for the vast majority of people. Is that the net result of these kinds of forums? Investors like Hines make an absolute fortune from real estate and residential development in this country but deliver housing that is absolutely unaffordable for the vast majority of working people and rents that are completely unaffordable. In the case of the Cherrywood development, we still do not know how much affordable housing is to be given to us in exchange for the LIHAF funding. There is still wrangling over how much affordable housing we are going to get and whether it will actually be affordable, that is, what the prices will be. Will the Taoiseach comment on that? This wealth and asset management company, Hines, has €95 billion worth of assets around the world. These are the sorts of people who are controlling our housing sector and the consequence of this is utterly unaffordable housing and rents. Does that not say something about the priorities of these corporations that swan around with politicians at the World Economic Forum in Davos?	spk_150

Did the Taoiseach raise that issue with the Chinese Premier?

People from that group who live in my area come into my office regularly and did so again recently to report what is happening. I wrote to the Tánaiste about it a while ago. Their relatives were grabbed and arrested because they are supporters of Falun Gong. That happens very regularly, with horrific accounts of the treatment of people who subscribe to that particular group. There is also the absolutely brutal suppression of democracy in Hong Kong. Anybody who articulates any dissent or opposition to the regime will suffer pretty brutal consequences. Did the Taoiseach raise those issues with the Chinese Premier? The inconsistency of European Governments, including our own, on the principles of human rights is stark. We are very quick to jump up and down about the lack of respect for human rights of certain regimes but we say less about others, perhaps because we see it as in our economic interest to do so. China is one such regime, the United States is another and, for many years, Israel has been another.

Richard Boyd Barrett	57	PBP	Dublin	#RichardBoydBarrett	2024-02-14	dail	33	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_14	The countries the Taoiseach visited are very much on the front line of what I will call the escalating new Cold War tensions between the expanded NATO and Putin and his bloc, as it were. It is worth noting that the Balkans is the crossroads of competing empires. Because of that, it was the place where the First World War began, and historically it has been so. These empires are banging up against each other with competing priorities, objectives and interests, and it has resulted in some pretty horrific conflicts. It is worth bearing in mind that historical context when we look at what is a very worrying situation. We all know Putin's invasion of Ukraine was an absolute disgrace. It was illegal, criminal, brutal and imperialist-driven. Equally, the expansion of NATO has not exactly helped matters, particularly when after the fall of the Soviet Union it was strongly urged by people like Gorbachev that it would not be a good idea, and that it would lead to conflict. Indeed, it has certainly contributed to it At his meetings, did the Taoiseach discuss NATO, the new Cold War and the dangerous tensions that are emerging? It is in the context of a new tailored arrangement between Ireland and NATO that has just been announced, which means we are going to be in a new formal co-operation arrangement with NATO. Is that not a really egregious breach of our neutrality? It is an arrangement with an alliance that is now even more discredited because its leading members, the United States Britain and Germany, are all up their necks in complicity with the Israel's crimes against the Palestinian people. They have really showed their moral bankruptcy and their true colours. If Putin is a nasty imperialist, is it not the case that equally, the dominant powers in NATO have shown themselves to be morally bankrupt, driven by self-interest and willing to support and tolerate some of the most horrific crimes? It should be all the more reason for us to keep a million miles away from NATO.	spk_162

The Israeli regime is planning to do it again. What kind of regime is capable of that atrocity?What kind of regime thinks it could get away with a genocide in front of the world and, when it is indicted for genocide, wants to continue? The answer is a regime for which there are never any consequences, ever. Words of criticism, even the quite strong language used by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and others today, mean nothing, as the Taoiseach rightly said, to Netanyahu, Smotrich and Ben-Gvir. Ministers today in the Israeli Government are saying they want destroy Gaza, adding to the litany of incitements to genocide made by that government over the past four months. Why do they continue? Why do they think they can do it again? It is because there are never any consequences. The United States continues to give them arms and weapons, as do European states like Germany and Britain. The European Union gives Israel favoured trade status and nobody imposes any sanctions. One of the things that this country can be most proud of is what the Dunnes Stores workers did in the mid-1980s when they went on strike for two years, forcing Ireland to become the first country in the world to impose comprehensive sanctions on apartheid South Africa, which began a domino effect that led to the dismantling of the apartheid regime. Guess who held out until the bitter end to defend that obnoxious regime? The United States and Britain, the same countries that are effectively giving licence to Israel to continue with its atrocities now. Be brave and do what this country did with apartheid South Africa in the mid-1980s, which helped to bring down that regime, admit that Israel is an apartheid state, an uncivilised state and a barbaric state and that it should have sanctions imposed on it to end the apartheid, end the occupation and end the possibility of the sort of genocidal slaughter we have seen for the past four months.	spk_9

Long before the current horrific escalation of violence, Israel was indicted for war crimes and crimes against humanity for its occupation, apartheid and ethnic cleansing, which has been going on for decades. The world did not sanction Israel. This Government refused to even use the word ""apartheid"" when it is blatantly an apartheid regime, it is blatant that the siege of Gaza was collective punishment of 2 million people and it is blatant that the Israeli Government is engaged in an ongoing campaign of ethnic cleansing. Impunity was granted and that has given Netanyahu and the crazed, bloodthirsty Ministers in his government, who are his lieutenants, the confidence to believe that they can continue with this massacre. We have to impose sanctions on this regime and admit it is not a normal state and it is an apartheid, colonial, brutal regime, and that if we want to see peace, as we do, it has to mean the end of that apartheid regime and there can be equality between Jews, Muslims, Christians and people of no religion who can share the land of Palestine as equals.We would not accept anything less anywhere else.

We have 190,000 children at risk of poverty in this country. One of the most damning facts is that child homelessness has gone through the roof and we now have 4,105 children and 2,000 families living in emergency accommodation. Child homelessness has gone up from October 2021, when there were 2,300 children in emergency accommodation, to over 4,100 now. It is shameful. The trauma, stigma and mental health impact on children are utterly unacceptable. What I want to know is what the Government is going to do about it. In every case of child homelessness that I come across, there does not seem to be a policy to stop children and their families from going into homelessness. When they are in homelessness, unless they are at the top of the housing list, they are told to find a HAP tenancy. However, the rents are so far ahead of the HAP thresholds that they have no chance of finding anywhere, so they are trapped in homelessness. In some cases, if the parents, or one of the parents, have an income that is over the threshold, they cannot even get HAP and they are totally trapped in homeless accommodation.

Richard Boyd Barrett	57	PBP	Dublin	#RichardBoydBarrett	2024-02-13	dail	33	Cabinet Committees	dbsect_10	I had a very interesting encounter with the Irish Second-Level Students Union yesterday. I spent the afternoon discussing with students from secondary schools up and down the country the issues they are concerned about. It highlighted for me the urgency of radical reform of our secondary school system and a few points should be borne in mind in that regard. One of the things they said was that there is absolutely nowhere for students to go if they are feeling anxious, worried, scared or bullied because we do not really have the necessary staff resources in schools or people who are trained to help. They were very keen on the idea that we would have psychologists in every school so that there would be somewhere to go. They were also scathing about the curriculum in the sense that most of it is rote learning out of books rather than more participatory education involving field trips, visits to museums or theatres, or meetings with people who are specialists and experts in a particular area, whereby they would feel motivated and would participate in their education, rather than just having to learn off books. That was very interesting but obviously it requires resources. They said that buses for things like that were a huge cost that most schools could not incur. They also said that when school inspections happen, the school inspectors never talk to the students about the issues affecting the school. It is all curriculum-based, rather than engaging with the students themselves about the issues affecting them.	spk_114

Following on from that, what some of the second level students said is that sometimes, teachers handpicked people to talk to inspectors but there was not engagement with the mass of students and there should be a bit more engagement on the ground. The other point they raised related to facilities in a lot of schools, which vary widely from inadequate heating systems to toilets that are completely inappropriate and do not allow for privacy and other such issues. The point about the curriculum really struck me. I take the Taoiseach's point about things becoming more interactive with technology and so on but it is a fact that while it varies, wealthier schools have more resources. When I asked about theatre trips, one student said they had been on three theatre trips while another said there was no way their school could possibly afford to go to the theatre. They would have to hire a bus which would cost a fortune and there is no way they could do it or that a lot of money would have to be raised, which would be punitive. They were all very strongly of the view that they would be able to engage far better with their education if there was more of that kind of thing – interactive field trips that made real the stuff in the books.	spk_119

Richard Boyd Barrett	57	PBP	Dublin	#RichardBoydBarrett	2024-02-13	dail	33	Departmental Programmes	dbsect_11	Child poverty and child homelessness are completely unacceptable. We have 190,000 children at risk of poverty in this country. One of the most damning facts is that child homelessness has gone through the roof and we now have 4,105 children and 2,000 families living in emergency accommodation. Child homelessness has gone up from October 2021, when there were 2,300 children in emergency accommodation, to over 4,100 now. It is shameful. The trauma, stigma and mental health impact on children are utterly unacceptable. What I want to know is what the Government is going to do about it. In every case of child homelessness that I come across, there does not seem to be a policy to stop children and their families from going into homelessness. When they are in homelessness, unless they are at the top of the housing list, they are told to find a HAP tenancy. However, the rents are so far ahead of the HAP thresholds that they have no chance of finding anywhere, so they are trapped in homelessness. In some cases, if the parents, or one of the parents, have an income that is over the threshold, they cannot even get HAP and they are totally trapped in homeless accommodation. Yet, the Government will not do anything to raise the thresholds, control the rents or increase the amount of social and affordable housing that we are getting in private developments.

That appear to be a likely outcome for hundreds of jobs, not those of the well-paid, high-profile people on obscene salaries, but those of the crew and technical people. I heard somebody describe it as an upstairs-downstairs culture. I heard in the audiovisual industry an incredible phrase referring to ""above-the-line people"" and ""below-the-line people"". The ""below-the-line people"" will end up being the ones who get it in the neck, with their jobs suppressed. That does not just affect them, but also young people, who the Minister should be concerned about, training in audiovisuals, getting degrees and going to college in all sorts of technical grades, camera work, hair and make-up and all the rest of it. Those jobs are disappearing or being outsourced and privatised. At the forum the Minister's Department organised last week and for which some of us campaigned long and hard, people working in the film industry referred over and over again to the precarity of their work and the lack of security of income and employment. In one of the places such security existed and where there were career opportunities for people qualified in technical grades in the audiovisual sector and in all the things that make television, their jobs will be suppressed. That will impact on the quality of public sector broadcasting and the range of services such broadcasting provides. Culture, arts, entertainment and music will lose out and be outsourced and privatised. Who benefits from all of this? As has been said, it is the big private digital corporations which are increasingly coming to control our media and are guilty of at least being conduits for disinformation, hate, division and all sorts of not so great things in our society. None of that means RTÉ was perfect or anything like it. We need reform but at least with a public sector broadcasting system the public has some influence on the situation. If it is all outsourced and privatised, we will have none and the Musks and the social media companies will control our media. That is why we need to scrap the licence and fund public sector broadcasting with a tax on those social media companies."	spk_205
