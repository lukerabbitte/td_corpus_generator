#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-14	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	I thank the Deputy and wish her and everyone in the House a happy St. Valentine's Day. It is very clear that we have significant problems in RTÉ. We see a culture of poor governance when decisions were not made or not made properly. We see a culture of arrogance from some of the senior people who were in charge of that organisation. We also see a wider culture of entitlement, a belief that the revenue from the licence fee should belong to RTÉ either entirely or for the greatest part. That sense of entitlement and thinking went back to the era when we had to fly Aer Lingus and had to get our electricity from the ESB. Things have moved on a lot since then. There is much more to public service broadcasting than RTÉ. I do not agree that there has been no accountability. A number of people have resigned from their posts. People have been called in before the Oireachtas committee and have accounted for their actions. Those who have not yet done so should in my view. I want to make that very clear. If any evidence of criminality or breaches of corporate law or company law are picked up in the audits, they will be referred to the Corporate Enforcement Authority. To date, that has not occurred but it may yet occur. In the meantime, the Government will decide on a new means of funding public service broadcasting. That must be a method that is fair, one that says to people who use and benefit from public service broadcasting that they should bear some of the cost. That is only fair. It also needs to say very clearly that it is not all about RTÉ. It is also about other forms of public service broadcasting, including that provided by local radio and local media, which report on council meetings and court proceedings, and also more widely supporting bursaries for journalists and encouraging international correspondents, whom we do not have enough of when we look at our news in Ireland. All that is really important because if there is one thing I have seen change dramatically over the course of the past 15 or 20 years in politics, it is how people get their information and news. More so than ever, reliable sources of information are required because people simply cannot trust news and information stories they see online. Unfortunately, many people do and that is to the detriment of our democracy, not just here but also abroad. The TV licence remains the law. The money does not all go to RTÉ; some of that goes to the public service broadcasting fund. It goes to Irish language programming, children's programming and news. Some of it helps to pay staff in RTÉ who have nothing to do with this at all and, I believe, must feel very demoralised at the moment because of all that is going on.I believe people should obey the law and pay their taxes and charges. It would be an affront and an insult to the majority of decent law-abiding citizens who have paid their TV licence fee to grant an amnesty to those who did not. It would be profoundly unfair. If we granted an amnesty to those who did not pay, we would come under pressure to provide rebates for those who did. Has the Deputy considered that? Is that also her party's policy? 	spk_79
#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-14	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	It is not. There are a number of options. One option is direct Exchequer funding but that funding might otherwise go to education, health or pensions, for example, and it would potentially give future governments undue influence over RTÉ if RTÉ was funded directly from the Exchequer. We know there is somebody in this House who might be head of the next Government and who is suing RTÉ at the moment. It would be a huge conflict of interest to have people who are suing RTÉ deciding how much money it gets paid. That is not the kind of democracy we want. It is the kind of thing we are starting to see happen in the United States and other places. I would not want that to be the case in our State. An alternative option is a household media charge collected by Revenue. That needs to be considered. Those options are under consideration by the Government and we will make a decision on that this year but it will require legislation-----	spk_81
#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-14	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	-----and it will require a system to set it up. In the meantime, the TV licence remains the law. People should obey the law, pay charges they are liable to pay and pay their taxes. That is a very simple thing. I do not believe in tax amnesties and never did. I do not think the policy the Deputy is pursuing is the right one. It is a return to left populism and is a mistake.	spk_83
#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-14	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	I cannot give a date today but we should make a decision on this in the coming weeks, and certainly in the coming months. I agree that at a time when misinformation and disinformation are rife and are undermining democracy here and around the world, it is important to fund public service media and broadcasting. That cannot just be about RTÉ for reasons I think we will all agree on. The current model is to fund it through a mixture of the Exchequer and the TV licence. We will examine the options of a full Exchequer system or a system like the Deputy proposes, which is combined Exchequer funding and a household charge. We will weigh up the options and decide how it is done. There will always need to be an element of Exchequer funding. The current TV licence exempts people on very low incomes and older people. That would have to be the case for any household charge too. The point the Deputy makes is very valid. Even if I may personally favour an Exchequer-funded model, which happens and works in some countries, I have a concern about such a model. It is that not this Government but perhaps a future government, led by the Deputy opposite, would have full control over the funding of RTÉ and public service broadcasting. There is a gross conflict of interest in somebody who is suing RTÉ deciding how much funding RTÉ would get. That would be a big problem for our democracy and we have to bear that in mind. 	spk_85
#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-14	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	The current position is the TV licence is the law. I encourage people to pay it, as I do and always have. It is not just about RTÉ; it is about Irish-language broadcasting, public service media, children's programming and the broadcasting fund, which supports many broadcasters and creators in the private sector who have their own small businesses. We need to bear that in mind when deciding whether to pay the TV licence fee.It is linked to television at the moment but that is old-fashioned. I know there are people who have suggested it be linked to having any sort of device but I do not think that is any more practical, quite frankly. The possibility of applying it to households could make sense and that is the proposal the Social Democrats as a party are making, although I think we would still need to exempt pensioners and very low-income households because it would be very regressive otherwise and I think the Deputy is agreed on that too. As any change will require legislation and will requires a system to be set up, there will not be a new system this year and the licence fee will continue to apply at least for the entirety of this year. We have to consider all of those options. In terms of a levy on social media companies, I am not sure that is a great idea. We already have a levy that is going to fund the media commission and that is due to be imposed on digital companies. We already have VAT on broadband, for example, and we have corporate profit taxes, which are being increased this year. There are already a number of taxes there and I am not sure it would be the right approach to add additional tax on top of that.	spk_87
#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-14	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	At the outset, I thank Deputy Naughten for raising this important issue and I know rare diseases are a cause the Deputy has championed for many years. I know the effect that rare diseases can have on many patients living with them and, at times, it can be difficult to assess the appropriate medicines, technologies and diagnostic tools. We made commitments in the programme for Government to ensure increased focus on rare diseases and people living with them and we are now developing a new rare diseases strategy, which will renew that focus. A rare diseases policy unit has been established in the Department of Health and a national rare diseases steering group was also established in December and has met three times since. The development of a new strategy will look to the future and the needs of those patients and families living with rare diseases and diagnoses. We expect to have the new plan ready well before the end of this year. The voices of patients and families will be central to the development of this policy and a patient forum has been established to ensure exactly that. In regard to the specific issue of the national laboratory capacity for genetic testing, we are fully committed to advancing genetic and genomic medicine in Ireland and building a national service. The central theme of the national strategy for accelerating genetic and genomic medicine in Ireland is to strengthen infrastructure and drive advances in genetics and genomics. This includes actions in regard to laboratory capacity. In particular, the National Genetics and Genomics Office is working to enhance existing laboratory infrastructure to promote the development and use of innovative technologies for testing, sample tracking and reporting. A national centre of excellence in genomic testing and bioinformatics will be established as a single entity and that will sit under the governance of the HSE. The national centre will work in collaboration with relevant clinical specialties and existing laboratory capacity in alignment with the new health regions. A genomics laboratory operating model is now being developed and, as part of this, for 2024, there is the development of a national genomic test directory for rare and inherited diseases.	spk_89
#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-14	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	I understand that some of the posts that were approved in 2023 were affected by the temporary pause on new recruitment. A new workforce plan for 2024 is being developed by the HSE and it will be able to increase its total staffing levels by between 2,000 and 3,000 over the course of this year. This will include genetic counsellors and the development of the genomic resource associate role to help patients navigate the genetic and genomic care pathway and improve the co-ordination of care. The €2.7 million provided to fund the implementation of the national strategy for genetics and genomics included the establishment of the national office of genomics and the appointment of key staff. In regard to the location of the new laboratory and whether it remains in Crumlin or not, I do not have a satisfactory answer for the Deputy today but I will discuss it with the Minister for Health and come back to him as soon as I can.	spk_91
#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-14	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta as a cuid ceisteanna. Caithfidh sos cogaidh a bheith ann anois. Tá an iomarca daoine básaithe agus gortaithe sa Phalaistín. This morning, the Spanish Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, and I wrote formally to the President of the European Commission, Ursula Von Der Leyen, expressing once again our deep concern at the deteriorating situation in Gaza and calling for an urgent assessment of whether Israel is in breach of the human rights obligations under the EU-Israel association agreement. The letter states that the expanded Israeli military operation in Rafah poses a grave and imminent threat that the international community must confront urgently. If the Commission concludes that Israel is in breach of its obligations under the agreement, then the Commission should propose a response, although suspension may well require unanimity of member states. I will set out briefly seven concrete actions the Government has taken in respect of this crisis in the Middle East. First, we were one of the first Governments in the world to call for a ceasefire. Second, we have increased our aid to the UN and UNRWA when other countries have suspended it because of allegations that some of the staff were involved in the 7 October massacre. Third, we have used our voice at the EU and the UN in support of the rights of Palestinian people. Fourth, we have sought that there be sanctions against violent settlers in the West Bank at EU level, and if we cannot get agreement with that at EU level, we will go ahead and do it with other like-minded EU member states. We have intervened in the International Criminal Court case on Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories and the Attorney General will travel personally to The Hague to make our case on 22 February. We have joined with Spain today in calling for the suspension of the EU-Israel association agreement and we are in discussions with other EU member states about recognising the state of Palestine. I want to be clear and honest with the Deputy, however, and with all Members of the House and the Irish people. None of these actions, in themselves, will bring about an end to this war. No war has ever been ended by a court order, the expulsion of an ambassador or the suspension of an agreement. To think so, frankly, is just make-believe. There are only three ways in which a war ends: military victory by one side over the other; a stalemate - a ceasefire like they have had in Korea for 75 years; or a political solution. Our focus is on the political solution and trying to work with our partners and allies, and even countries that are not our partners and allies, in the Arab world, the EU, across America and, indeed, in the global south, to bring about a ceasefire. That is what is needed - an immediate ceasefire so the killing can stop, aid can get in and hostages can be released, as they should be released, moving towards a permanent ceasefire and then a permanent political solution, which is the establishment of two states side by side, living in peace with each other.	spk_93
#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-14	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	I really hope we do not make this conflict or these terrible events that are happening in the Middle East to be in any way about us. It is not about us or the differences between the different parties here or between the Government and the Opposition. It is about the civilian population in Israel and the civilian population in the Palestinian territories. I disagree with the Deputy on two counts, even though we agree on most things. First, absolutely nothing Israel is doing at the moment is being done in our name. She has suggested that twice or three times. Absolutely nothing the state of Israel is doing is being done in our name. I want to make that very clear as the Head of Government and on behalf of the Government, at least. Second, I do not accept that we are standing idly by. In my initial response, I set out seven concrete actions we have taken already. When I meet representatives of Palestinians or the Palestinian Authority or leaders of other Arab countries, they thank us for the stance we are taking. We are seen as a country that is showing leadership on this issue, but we have to do it in a way that makes sense, is smart and allows us to continue to try to bring countries with us. At the first meeting of the European Council after this conflict started, we were in a minority in calling for a ceasefire. We are now in the clear majority and we have to ensure we are able to bring people with us - not people who already agree with us, but people who do not yet but might into the future.	spk_97
#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-14	dail	33	Ceisteanna ar Pholasaí nó ar Reachtaíocht - Questions on Policy or Legislation	dbsect_10	I will certainly look into it and see what can be done. Over the past number of years we have tried to improve the financial position of carers. We have increased the carer support grant which is not means tested. We relaxed the means test for the carer's allowance, increased it and extended free GP care to anyone in receipt of the carer's allowance. We will strive to continue on that pathway of improving things for carers. I appreciate that when it comes to respite services we have some real difficulties. Generally speaking that has been down to finding staff who are available to staff these centres. I do not know the exact situation in relation to Cavan at the moment but I will check up on that and come back to the Deputy during the week.	spk_99
#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-14	dail	33	Ceisteanna ar Pholasaí nó ar Reachtaíocht - Questions on Policy or Legislation	dbsect_10	My understanding is that the allocations are made every year based on the profile of the children in the school. For example, in any given year children with particular needs may leave the school and move on to another one or more kids with special needs may come in. It is based on the profile of the children in the school, not on the school itself. I understand that what Deputy Ó Ríordáin is saying is correct. We have 1,000 more special education teachers than we had back in 2021 and two thirds of schools will be gaining hours or having the number of hours remain the same. About one third of schools will be losing and in most cases, this loss will be less than five hours. My understanding is that this is based on the profile of the children currently in the school or due to be in the school for next year.	spk_101
#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-14	dail	33	Ceisteanna ar Pholasaí nó ar Reachtaíocht - Questions on Policy or Legislation	dbsect_10	I can guarantee that. It might not necessarily be their school of first preference but I can guarantee that everyone in Kildare and also in my own constituency of Dublin West, where this also occurs, will receive a secondary school place. That is an absolute commitment and an absolute guarantee. Figures are used from the census and also from child benefit data. When it comes to secondary schools, the number of children enrolled in primary schools determines the need for secondary school places. What we have, though, on a lot of occasions is children's names being put down for multiple schools but schools cannot share that information for data protection reasons. What happens, and it certainly happens in my constituency, is that it appears at the start that there is a huge number of children without school places. Then, when the places are allocated and accepted or not, that number becomes much smaller and very often those children are not actually in the catchment are of the school to which they have applied.	spk_103

A key issue that has been raised relates to incremental progression.

I hope by then there is already a ceasefire. Let us pray there is but either way, I will be sharing our views with our friends and colleagues in the US. It is important to say that the US, Egypt and Qatar are working together on a ceasefire proposal and it is incumbent on Israel and Hamas to accept the ceasefire proposal that is on the table.	spk_109

I have a four-page note that I could read out for the Deputy but I am not going to do that because time is limited but of course, the employer and the Government will engage with the representatives of the adult tutors with a view to coming to a resolution. If that cannot be done then, of course, there are options like the WRC or the Labour Court.	spk_111

It has been raised with me by Deputies Feighan and MacSharry as well. It was expected that patients and staff at The Rock community hospital would move to the new community hospital in Ballyshannon this week. However, it emerged that following a vote taken by the nurses' union, staff refused to move to the new facility, citing concerns over staffing levels. In the interests of maintaining good employee relations, the HSE has agreed to defer the planned move and has requested further discussions on it. The Government stands ready to intervene. That would be through both sides going to the Workplace Relations Commission, which is under the auspices of the Minister, Deputy Coveney. The opening of the new community hospital in Ballyshannon is a priority and it will be fully operational at the earliest possible date.	spk_115

I had a chance to speak to the Minister, Mr. O'Dowd, about this on my trip to Stormont last Monday. In the next week or two we should be in a position to make a revised financial commitment to the A5.

There are other projects too such as the ones in Castlemartyr and Ringaskiddy. I could name a few more such as the project linking Carrigtohill, Midleton and Youghal. We will do our best to fund as many of the projects as possible. We are certainly keen to keep them alive and keep them going.

He and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, are two of the strongest advocates in the House on these issues. There was a change in the Revised Estimate in December in which we allocated a certain amount - I cannot recall the exact amount - for new medicines. It was not specifically for rare diseases but for new medicines generally. That means the HSE can approve new medicines out of the dedicated fund and from savings in the drugs budget more widely. I agree with the Deputy that it is important, when it comes to the strategies we produce, that we provide the funding to implement them. I know it has been a source of a lot of frustration, particularly in healthcare. There are some very good strategies and models of care but not always the funds to fully implement them.	spk_137

My programme included engagements with businesses with investments or interests in Ireland. I spoke at a dinner hosted by IDA Ireland, which was attended by business leaders from the manufacturing, chemical, technology and finance sectors. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael McGrath, also attended. I met with senior representatives of multinational companies with a significant imprint in Ireland. These meetings are typically an important opportunity for company executives to update me on progress with their operations in Ireland and their future development plans. I participated in a panel discussion on the hard power of artificial intelligence, which reflected on the opportunities and challenges of AI, especially in the areas of diplomacy and defence. Developments on artificial intelligence were a focus of discussions throughout the meeting, with many policymakers and business leaders conscious of the need to balance the risks and opportunities of the technology and to regulate in a way that protects the public interest while encouraging innovation.

#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-14	dail	33	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_14	I thank Deputies for their questions. As was said earlier there are lots of conspiracy theories about Davos and the World Economic Forum, and particularly online. No big decisions are made there. In fact no decisions are made at all. If that was the case I would stay for the whole thing. As it happens I had to leave early and arrive late. I arrived late because the Chinese Prime Minister was visiting Ireland, and I had to leave early because I wanted to get to an event in Galway. I can guarantee that if the far right were correct I would not have arrived late and left early; I would have been there for the whole thing to sit in some secret room and make all these decisions they believe we make. I am a bit disappointed to hear Deputy Paul Murphy in some ways almost fuelling some of those theories by arguing that he almost understands why people believe these conspiracy theories. It is the far right and the far left working together again, which is not all that unusual. With regard to what happens there, it is a gathering of political, business and NGO leaders, along with academics and experts. It is worth attending. It is run very efficiently. There are 30-minute meeting slots, which start on time and end on time. They stick to the agenda. To organise those kinds of meetings with the people who attend - perhaps ten meetings in one day - would take weeks to organise. It is a gathering where a lot of people attend and where one can fit in a lot of meetings and get work done that otherwise would take a lot of time to organise. There are also roundtable discussions and dinners. I did not meet Hines at Davos or any asset management companies. I am not sure if they requested to meet me or not. The letter written to President von der Leyen was published this morning but we do not have a response yet. In fairness, it was only officially submitted this morning. President von der Leyen will need a bit of time to respond to it. I spoke with her by phone earlier in the week to discuss a number of different matters and I alerted her to the fact that Prime Minister Sánchez and I were writing this letter. I thought it was important she hear that from me and not from the media. Deputy McDonald asked questions around climate. We are making progress and progress is now accelerating. Emissions from Ireland are falling and while they are not falling fast enough they are falling. We are seeing a real improvement in the amount of renewable energy we are producing. We have a target of 80% renewable electricity by 2030. I think we will meet that target. If we miss it I do not think we will miss it by much. People were very sceptical about electric vehicles a few years ago when then Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, produced his climate action plan on behalf of the Government at the time but we are now in line to meet those targets, which is really encouraging. We also retrofit about 35,000 homes every year. Again that is in line or exceeding our targets for retrofit. We are also seeing emissions fall from agriculture. I thank and recognise farmers for that fact. The new forestry programme will be helpful too.	spk_154
#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-14	dail	33	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_14	I proposes to take Questions Nos. 9 to 15, inclusive, together. I welcomed Premier Li Qiang to Ireland on 17 January for a working visit which marked 45 years of diplomatic relations between Ireland and China. In addition to our bilateral meeting, there was a working lunch that included several Chinese ministers, the Governor of the Central Bank of China, the Tánaiste and the Ministers, Deputies Ryan, Foley, McConalogue and Coveney. I had a productive meeting with Premier Li and his delegation. We agreed there is more we can do economically, including boosting trade. Importantly, the Premier confirmed that the pause on beef exports to China had been lifted. This was very welcome news for farmers and food producers around the country. It is testament to the very hard work that they do in ensuring that Irish food is of the highest quality. Premier Li confirmed China’s decision to extend a visa exemption to Irish passport holders wishing to travel to China for 15 days or less. This is very good news for tourists, business people and those visiting friends or relatives, who no longer need to apply for a visa to go to China provided they are only there for 15 days or less. We discussed global issues, including the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. I was very clear that our relationship must be based on values and mutual interests. I expressed our strong commitment to a rules-based international order, based on the UN Charter and respect for fundamental rights. As we do in all our engagements with the Chinese Government, I raised human rights with Premier Li, including our concerns around the human rights situation in Xinjiang and in Hong Kong, and in the other special autonomous regions. I also mentioned the specific case of Jimmy Lai. I welcomed the resumption of the EU-China human rights dialogue to discuss these and other issues, including Tibet and the situation regarding human rights defenders. Overall, it was a very good and useful meeting, underlining the need for us to engage with China as a very important actor in the world if we are to deal effectively with the global challenges we all face.	spk_155
#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-14	dail	33	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_14	Decisions on security matters, including road closures such as, for example, in the Phoenix Park, are not made by me. They are security matters, they are dealt with by the Garda and the Defence Forces and they must, of course, remain confidential. At my meeting with the Chinese Premier, I raised our concerns about the treatment of the Uyghur population in Xinjiang. Premier Li disputed the veracity of those concerns and invited me to visit the region to see with my own eyes what the situation is there. I urged China to implement the recommendations of the recent UN report issued by Michelle Bachelet on the situation and to engage proactively with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. I also raised our concerns with regard to the human rights situation in the other special autonomous regions of Tibet and Hong Kong but we did not discuss any particular religious groups, including Falun Gong. I stressed our ongoing concerns about the national security law in Hong Kong and the clampdown there on media freedoms. We welcomed the resumption of the EU-China human rights dialogue to discuss issues including Tibet and the situation regarding human rights defenders. In June last year, the European Council set out its approach to China, shared by all EU states, which makes clear our desire to engage with the Chinese Government. The EU wants to see a balanced, reciprocal and mutually beneficial relationship with China, with a level playing field for our businesses. I am particularly pleased to see co-operation mechanisms between the EU and China advanced. It is important that China and the EU have strong and productive engagements on critical issues like climate, digital development and the sustainable development goals. It is equally important that we engage with China guided by values and interests. We welcome that the dialogue has continued. I also reaffirmed Ireland's long-standing adherence to the One China policy and our recognition of the People's Republic of China as the legitimate Government of China. We emphasised our view that any change to the current  Deputy Ó Murchú referred to the tech sector. I join him in expressing my regret at the bad news about the jobs at PayPal that will be lost in his constituency. It is important that workers get a decent redundancy package. That is normally the case when a large successful company lays off staff. Certainly, the Government will be there to make sure they get any social welfare entitlements they may need, as well as advice around job search, alternative jobs and careers, and perhaps help with going back to education, gaining a new skill or setting up their own enterprise. I know people who lost jobs in the tech sector previously who went on to set up their own businesses and have done extremely well. I wish the workers the best in that regard. The Deputy also raised the letter to President von der Leyen. We invited other countries to co-sign the letter. They declined for their own reasons and that has to remain confidential for reasons of diplomatic confidentiality. My understanding is that any decision to formally suspend the agreement would require a unanimous decision because foreign policy matters are subject to unanimity in the EU and do not fall under qualified majority voting. I would be up for that being changed. I would like to see the EU adopt common foreign policies by qualified majority voting. We would need to have a reasoned debate about that in this House and among the general public because while we would be on the winning side of most votes, we would not always be. We would have to bear in mind that this would leave us in a situation sometimes where we would be bound by foreign policy positions we do not support. That happens in other fields of EU competence but not as yet on foreign policy. We would need a proper debate about it if we were ever to go down that line.	spk_160
#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-14	dail	33	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_14	I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 to 20, inclusive, together. I visited the western Balkans from 10 to 12 January 2024. My visit to Kosovo was an opportunity, in particular, to thank the Irish members of the Defence Forces serving with the Kosovo Force, KFOR, and the Irish people serving with the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo, EULEX, for the vital work they do in contributing to peace and security in that country. My visit to three western Balkans countries, namely, Kosovo, Montenegro and North Macedonia, was also an opportunity to reiterate Ireland's long-standing and strong wish to see the countries of the western Balkans join the European Union as soon as they are ready.Ireland has long endorsed their journey towards membership, and we will continue to do so.  As I said in my meetings with leaders in all three countries, enlargement is, and must remain, merit-based. Undertaking the reforms and legal preparations necessary for membership is challenging, as it should be. However, the prize at the end of a difficult path is membership of the European Union which, as this country knows well, can be transformative in economic and social terms. I urged all leaders I met to continue to take the steps necessary. I also said that Ireland is their friend, and will continue to make the case that once a country is ready for membership, it should be allowed to join. There should be no requirement to wait until others are ready, or for internal reforms within the EU. We should not put up unnecessary or additional barriers. In Pristina, I met the Prime Minister of Kosovo, Albin Kurti, and the President, Vjosa Osmani-Sadriu. Both briefed me on efforts to de-escalate tensions between Kosovars and ethnic Serbs in the northern part of the country. I urged them to continue to do all they could to advance this and to engage in the EU-facilitated Belgrade-Pristina dialogue aimed at normalising relations between Kosovo and Serbia.  There is great interest in Kosovo in how Ireland engages with our global diaspora. As a country that has experienced considerable emigration, Kosovo was interested to know how it can maintain and strengthen relations with Kosovars around the world. I offered to share any lessons from our national experience that might be useful.  In Podgorica, I met the Prime Minister of Montenegro, Milojko Spajić. and the President, Jakov Milatović. Montenegro is further advanced in preparations for EU membership than others, and both leaders were keen to ensure that it should be able to join once ready. We also discussed ways to deepen our bilateral relations, especially in the economic sphere.  My visit to Skopje, the capital of North Macedonia, was the first to that country by a serving Irish Taoiseach. I met Prime Minister Dimitar Kovačevski and President Stevo Pendarovski. North Macedonia has faced challenges in its efforts to advance its case for EU membership, including agreeing to change the name of the country and agreeing to amend its constitution to reflect the presence of a Bulgarian minority in the country. They are, therefore, naturally keen to ensure that no new or further obstacles, other than those required of all applicants, are placed in their path. 	spk_161
#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-14	dail	33	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_14	I thank Deputies for their remarks. I do not think Deputy Boyd Barrett meant to say it but, just in case I misheard him, I do not think we should in any way equate the expansion of NATO to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. That is part of the Russian narrative and a Russian speaking point, to blame NATO expansion or use it as an excuse for what it has done in Ukraine.

#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-14	dail	33	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_14	-----in order to prevent it from joining NATO, which would be its choice, not Russia's, in my view. Whether we agree with NATO expansion or not, I think it is up to individual countries and their democratically elected governments to decide whether they want to join. It should not be decided in Russia or other places. We of course discussed NATO in our conversations. All three are members. We are not. Most of the countries that I meet in Europe are interested to know why we are not members and how we would defend ourselves in the event of a serious attack. It is fair to say that Montenegro and Macedonia feel more secure, although they are really concerned about Russian interference in their countries and democracies. Kosovo is a little bit less secure because the situation with Serbia is much more tense. The individually tailored partnership programme, ITPP, was not specifically discussed in any of my meetings. I would have said to them that we are part of the Partnership for Peace, PfP, and have been since 1999. PfP has a separate identity and is based on individual bilateral relationships between NATO and each of the PfP countries. We have no plans to join NATO. However, access to NATO training and standards through participation in PfP has been of benefit to the Defence Forces, particularly when on service with the UN and EU, where they can be interoperable. It is a tailored framework for co-operation and is completely voluntary in nature. I should say that the White Paper on Defence states that Ireland will continue to participate in NATO's PfP with a view to ensuring the Defence Forces have the necessary interoperable capabilities to participate in modern and demanding peacekeeping operations alongside other EU military forces. I do not agree that an end to the triple lock would be an end to our neutrality. Our neutrality goes back to the 1940s. The triple lock has only been around for maybe 20 or 30 years. It was done in response to some conspiracy theories about a European referendum. I do not believe the five permanent members of the UN Security Council should have a veto at all and I do not believe that any one of them should be able to veto decisions by a sovereign Irish Government to take part in a peacekeeping operation. That is why I would like to see it removed. We do not have any date for that to be done. I do not know if it will be done in the period of this Dáil. Deputies Ó Murchú and Haughey both asked about accession and enlargement. It is ten years since any country joined the European Union. The last one was Croatia. It is now in the eurozone. I do not think that anyone regrets the fact that Croatia is a member. I would like to see countries join as soon as they are ready. I think it should be done on a case-by-case basis. Not everyone on the European Council agrees that. They would like to see it as a bigger package or an enlargement of the many, linked to institutional reforms. I and the Government have a different view. Let us not forget that we were part of the first enlargement. We joined with Britain and Denmark. I would not like us to be told that we had to wait for somebody else. That would not have been fair. It is important that the one or two countries that are most ready should be allowed to join soon because if that does not happen, people will lose faith in those countries that they will ever be allowed in, then people in the countries that are further back and less ready, rather than turning to pro-European forces, pro-European parties and democratic parties, might turn to the extremes. That is a real fear that I have. It is noteworthy that Montenegro and Kosovo have already adopted the euro even though they are not in the European Union.	spk_170

My programme included engagements with businesses with investments or interests in Ireland. I spoke at a dinner hosted by IDA Ireland, which was attended by business leaders from the manufacturing, chemical, technology and finance sectors. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael McGrath, also attended. I met with senior representatives of multinational companies with a significant imprint in Ireland. These meetings are typically an important opportunity for company executives to update me on progress with their operations in Ireland and their future development plans. I participated in a panel discussion on the hard power of artificial intelligence, which reflected on the opportunities and challenges of AI, especially in the areas of diplomacy and defence. Developments on artificial intelligence were a focus of discussions throughout the meeting, with many policymakers and business leaders conscious of the need to balance the risks and opportunities of the technology and to regulate in a way that protects the public interest while encouraging innovation. This balanced approach chimes with the approach the Government is taking. I also attended a foreign policy-focused event organised by 	spk_149
#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-14	dail	33	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_15	I thank Deputies for their questions. As was said earlier there are lots of conspiracy theories about Davos and the World Economic Forum, and particularly online. No big decisions are made there. In fact no decisions are made at all. If that was the case I would stay for the whole thing. As it happens I had to leave early and arrive late. I arrived late because the Chinese Prime Minister was visiting Ireland, and I had to leave early because I wanted to get to an event in Galway. I can guarantee that if the far right were correct I would not have arrived late and left early; I would have been there for the whole thing to sit in some secret room and make all these decisions they believe we make. I am a bit disappointed to hear Deputy Paul Murphy in some ways almost fuelling some of those theories by arguing that he almost understands why people believe these conspiracy theories. It is the far right and the far left working together again, which is not all that unusual. With regard to what happens there, it is a gathering of political, business and NGO leaders, along with academics and experts. It is worth attending. It is run very efficiently. There are 30-minute meeting slots, which start on time and end on time. They stick to the agenda. To organise those kinds of meetings with the people who attend - perhaps ten meetings in one day - would take weeks to organise. It is a gathering where a lot of people attend and where one can fit in a lot of meetings and get work done that otherwise would take a lot of time to organise. There are also roundtable discussions and dinners. I did not meet Hines at Davos or any asset management companies. I am not sure if they requested to meet me or not. The letter written to President von der Leyen was published this morning but we do not have a response yet. In fairness, it was only officially submitted this morning. President von der Leyen will need a bit of time to respond to it. I spoke with her by phone earlier in the week to discuss a number of different matters and I alerted her to the fact that Prime Minister Sánchez and I were writing this letter. I thought it was important she hear that from me and not from the media. Deputy McDonald asked questions around climate. We are making progress and progress is now accelerating. Emissions from Ireland are falling and while they are not falling fast enough they are falling. We are seeing a real improvement in the amount of renewable energy we are producing. We have a target of 80% renewable electricity by 2030. I think we will meet that target. If we miss it I do not think we will miss it by much. People were very sceptical about electric vehicles a few years ago when then Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, produced his climate action plan on behalf of the Government at the time but we are now in line to meet those targets, which is really encouraging. We also retrofit about 35,000 homes every year. Again that is in line or exceeding our targets for retrofit. We are also seeing emissions fall from agriculture.

#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-13	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	The new national children's hospital will be completed later this year and will be open and treating children next year. When it is open, it will be an incredible state-of-the-art hospital. It will care for our children for the next 50 to 100 years and it will be comparable if not superior to many of the best children's hospitals in Europe and around the world.It will be our first digital public hospital, with 300 individual rooms for every child that needs to be admitted and space for their parents to sleep in the room beside them. It will have more theatres, more scanners and facilities we could not even imagine now, compared with what we have at the moment. I look forward to the hospital opening next year and seeing patients being treated there for the first time. The Cabinet today agreed to increase the maximum allocation for the hospital to €1.9 billion capital, that is, for the build, and €0.3 billion current, that is, for the commissioning, decommissioning and transition to the new hospital, which will happen next year. The total cost will be €2.2 billion, of which €1.4 billion has already been drawn down. The project has taken much longer than anyone anticipated and there will be years of dispute with the contractor about payments even when the hospital is fully open. This will not impact on other projects because the cost of this is spread out over ten to 15 years. We expect handover to occur this year and expect it to be open to patients next year. It is important when we talk about the entire cost of this project that we do not make the mistake of thinking it is just about building the very large building which we can now all see in Dublin 8 next to St. James's Hospital. It is also the satellite centre in Connolly in Blanchardstown open and treating patients and the satellite centre in Tallaght. It also involves some of the costs associated with the original Mater project and Crumlin and Temple St. hospitals have to be decommissioned too, so it is a huge project across five sites. On the Deputy's earlier remark, waiting lists in Irish hospitals are going down. We have said that nobody should wait more than ten to 12 weeks to see a consultant if he or she needs to or to get an operation if he or she needs it. While I accept they are still too long, unlike most countries in the world, including the jurisdiction north of the Border, waiting lists in Ireland have fallen for the last two years in a row. In paediatric spinal surgery, the waiting list has fallen in the past year. While that is not by close to enough, it is important that I correct misinformation because it is the norm in the Deputy's contributions here on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.	spk_2

The sum of €2.2 billion is the maximum allocation made by the Government for this project; we will not be allocating any more. Some €1.4 billion has been drawn down already and an additional €0.8 billion is available to complete the project, commission it and open it to children. That will happen next year.	spk_4
#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-13	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I share the Deputy’s distress and horror at the events that we are seeing unfold in Gaza. The ground assault on Rafah should not happen; 1.5 million people are taking refuge there, most of them already displaced from other parts of Gaza and some displaced on more than one occasion. There is a serious risk of a massacre occurring in Rafah if a ground assault were to occur, and that would be a gross violation of international law on top of all the other violations of international law for which Israel is responsible. We were among the first countries in the world and among the first parliaments in the world to call for a ceasefire. That is correct. There is now a ceasefire proposal on the table, negotiated by Egypt, Qatar and the Americans. Both Hamas and Israel should accept that ceasefire offer, in my view. It will last for three months and will allow the hostages to be released, and they should be released, the killing to stop and aid to get in to Palestinian civilians. Then there is the possibility to build on that three-month ceasefire, make it permanent, enable the removal of the Hamas leadership and fighters from Gaza and, potentially, new elections in Israel. In terms of the actions that we are taking, we have taken many actions. We have increased funding for the UN and UNRWA in Gaza and the West Bank when other countries have suspended their funding, incorrectly in my view. We have voiced our position and voted in support of the Palestinian people at the UN and the EU. We have called for the EU-Israel association agreement to be suspended, based on our view that Israel may be in violation of the human rights clause within that, and I spoke to the European Commission President on that only yesterday. It does, however, require unanimity at EU level to do so and as the Deputy is aware, there is not unanimity at EU level to do so. In relation to the International Criminal Court, the Attorney General will be in the Hague on 22 February to make our case before that court in regard to Israel's ongoing occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.We will certainly review what the Deputy mentioned in relation to the ISIF and trade. Our advice from the Attorney General, the previous Attorney General and the Attorney General before that was that trade is very clearly an EU competence and is not in the competence of this Parliament to legislate for. We all need to be realistic. These are the actions we are taking and they are considerable, and we will take more. Recognition, alongside other countries, is one of the things we are working on at the moment and discussing with other countries and EU allies. It is clear to me, though, that Israel is not listening to any country in the world. I do not even think they are listening to the Americans any more. They have become blinded by rage and are going to make their own security situation much worse in the long term by going down the path they are going.	spk_6
#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-13	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	We have taken considerable actions to date and we will take more. As I stated, the Attorney General will represent Ireland at the International Criminal Court in The Hague on 22 February to make the case against the occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. We are in discussions with other EU member states about recognising statehood and doing it in a meaningful way. Spain is the main country with which we are discussing that. It would not be fair of me to disclose the names of the other countries; it is for them to do so. Suffice to say that Belgium, which currently holds the Presidency, would not be in a position to do so while it holds the Presidency. We need to be honest about the situation we see unfolding in the Middle East. We have taken action and we will even take more action but it is clear to me that the Israeli Government does not listen to us or the rest of the world. It probably does not even listen to the Americans any more. That is what makes the situation all the more dangerous and worrying. We need to be honest with people about that, too. I am concerned that there are people who shout at us and abuse us on the streets. Maybe they do not do it to the Deputy but they certainly do it to me and my colleagues. They believe there is some action we can take that will change Benjamin Netanyahu's mind. That is incorrect and I do not think people should spread that idea. It is irresponsible, actually.	spk_8
#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-13	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	As I said earlier, there is a ceasefire proposal on the table negotiated by the Egyptians, Qataris and Americans. It is our strong view that Israel and Hamas should both accept that ceasefire proposal. It will allow the killing to stop. It will allow refugees, or at least some of them, to return to their homes and it will allow aid, which is desperately needed by Palestinian civilians, to get in. It will also facilitate the release of more than 100 Israeli hostages who have been held for more than three months now, against their will, by Hamas. If we can secure that three-month ceasefire, there is a real possibility of that becoming permanent. That will, of course, require the removal of the Hamas leadership and fighters from that territory. I echo the comments of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, earlier today. I do not believe that you respond to a massacre with more massacres and I do not believe that you can defeat a monster by behaving like a monster yourself. We will continue to work with our partners in the EU and other parts of the world to do what we can do that we believe will be effective. On trade sanctions, the Deputy will be aware that trade is an EU competence and has been since the Single European Act.	spk_10

#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-13	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	In relation to the single-state solution, I think that is naive. It is a really nice idea. It might be the kind of thing that Deputy Boyd Barrett and I would sign up to, being secular people, but it is very evident to me that the people of Israel do not want a single-state solution, they want a Jewish state, and most Palestinians, many of whom voted for Hamas in the last election, want an Islamic state. That is the reality of it. I heard what the Deputy said - that the West should impose it on them - but is that not exactly why we so many problems in the world, because the west tried to impose its solutions on other parts of the world, whether it was partition or imposing systems of government that people do not want? It is a funny form of imperialism that the Deputy is actually advocating himself, that the west should impose on people in Israel and Palestine a system or a statehood that they do not want.	spk_16
#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-13	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	As I said before and will continue to say, migration is a very sensitive issue and is abused by politicians all over the world to gain votes. Often, that is based on misinformation and hate-mongering. I will say it again - migration, in the round, has been a very good thing for Ireland. If it was not for migrants coming here to work in our health service, build our houses and look after our older people, we would not be able to provide the kind of services we provide now. Far from being the cause of our problems, migration is part of the solution to many of them, particularly when it comes to building new homes and running our health and social care services. The major companies that invest in Ireland and pay billions in tax, which allows us to run our schools, hospitals and pension system, would not be here were it not for the fact that they can attract skilled labour from all over the world. Our buses would not run, our restaurants would not operate and our shops would not be open. I will say that again and again any time anyone raises the issue of migration in this Chamber because it is important that we always acknowledge that at the start of any contribution. I hope other Members, including Opposition Members, will at least do that too. The number of people coming through Dublin Airport without documents has fallen. We have stepped up our activities in that regard.	spk_19
#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-13	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	There are now gardaí in airports in other parts of Europe working with authorities there. We increasingly check people coming off planes, not just at border control. We are liaising with airlines to make sure their staff are properly trained. There are fines which we impose on airlines if they allow people onto aircraft undocumented. We are seeing a reduction in the number of people coming through Dublin Airport undocumented. We estimate, and believe based on evidence, that the majority of people who seek international protection in Ireland come across the Border from north to south. I do not think anyone is suggesting we close the Border between the North and South. Of course, they go in the other direction too. That is the reality of the situation. The Deputy said two things that require at least a degree of correction and explanation. Some 40% of people who apply for international protection get it. That is not far off half. We need to bear in mind when people see a group of migrants coming into the country that roughly half of them are determined by our system as deserving of international protection. It is not a small minority; it is 40%, which is not far off half. That is why we need to make sure we assess everybody's application fairly. If somebody comes to an airport without documents, they are sent back. However, if they apply for international protection, in that scenario, they are allowed to have their application heard fairly. Unless the Deputy is suggesting that we leave the UN and exempt ourselves from international law and become some of a hermit kingdom, that will continue to be the case. That is just not common sense. It is not always the case that people destroy their documents. We do not find destroyed documents in bins or bathrooms. What happens is that they are trafficked into the country and the person who trafficked them takes the IDs off them at a certain point, probably while they are still on the plane. We are doing everything we can to crack down on trafficking. That is why it is so important that we are part of the EU asylum pact because we can only do that on a multilateral basis.	spk_22

#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-13	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	It is because of actions taken by the Government. If somebody enters the country through Dublin Airport without documents, one of two things happens. Either they get sent back, and that happens all the time, or alternatively, if they apply for international protection, they are entitled to have that application assessed properly and as quickly as we can. That is what we do. It is not correct to make the automatic assumption that if somebody enters the county in an undocumented manner he or she has committed a crime.	spk_31

As Taoiseach, I have a responsibility to think about the safety of our citizens and our troops on the borders of Israel. Arson is a serious crime that is punishable by up to ten years in prison. Garda investigations are under way and we expect there will be prosecutions. I agree that we need to see prosecutions and convictions. It is deeply ironic that people who oppose migration and connect migration with criminal activity are the criminals themselves who are carrying out the very serious crime of arson. While I believe that many protestors may very well be decent and good people, I do not believe that protestors who spent the entire day and night outside a building did not see anything before the building burned down. They need to be held accountable for their silence and complicity. It is our intention to have the Planning and Development Bill enacted before the summer recess. This gives us four to five months to do it. I would hope that is enough time for us in this House to deal with the matter. It is linked to the housing crisis and should be doable in that time schedule. On the query about statements, I am happy to have statements on any of the matters Deputies raised. I do not think we can have a statement on Garda strategy but we certainly could have a statement on the issue of arson and the attacks on buildings more widely.

The HSE service plan next year provides for it to hire an additional 2,000 to 3,000 staff. I do not know what the Deputy's definition of a recruitment freeze is but 8,000 extra staff last year and another 2,000 or 3,000 this year, to me, is not a recruitment freeze. However, it will not be the free-for-all we have seen in previous years. It cannot be and it should not be. As part of the plans, 400 more beds will be opened between community and acute hospitals, there will be provision for waiting lists to fall again this year, which will be third year in a row and some of the savings will come from a reduction in agency staff.	spk_59

We have clearly called for the EU-Israel Association Agreement to be on the table because we believe Israel may have breached the human rights clause.

We will make a decision on a new funding model this year. It will either be a household charge collected by the Revenue or Exchequer funding, and we will make that decision this year.

That is four times the amount when I was first appointed to Government in 2011. That is the extent to which we have ramped up investment in public infrastructure in recent years. The additional amount to be allocated is €2.25 billion over the next three years. The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, is currently in negotiations with Ministers about how that will be allocated and to which Departments. As the Deputy can imagine, Ministers have ideas and bills attached to them that run to many multiples of €2.25 billion.

Two GPs are now qualifying every year for every one who retires. I appreciate that is against the backdrop of a rising population and increased demand. There are particular challenges in disadvantaged parts of our urban areas and also in rural areas.

A number of years ago, the Department of Foreign Affairs commissioned a report on this and set out a number of actions that can be taken to assist Irish people returning home. Roughly 30,000 Irish citizens come home every year - 90,000 in the past three years. In many cases, they have not been away for long and so it can be straightforward but where they have been away for a long time, it can be much more challenging, as is often the case in moving to another country. There are things we can do that are under our control and we are working on them. Unfortunately, others are more complicated, particularly regarding banking records and so on. We are keen to assist our citizens to move back home should they wish to and they are returning home in very big numbers.	spk_77

Sometimes restoration and maintenance of existing roads and funding for new local and regional roads get mixed up in the one pot which can create the appearance of a cut. For example, in County Kildare, which the Ceann Comhairle will know very well, the fact that the Athy bypass is now open and running means Kildare does not get money for that new road again, which is separate from regional and local roads.

#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-13	dail	33	Cabinet Committees	dbsect_10	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 7, inclusive, together. The work of the child poverty and well-being programme office is to prioritise action across government in areas that will have the greatest effect for children and families experiencing poverty. From Poverty to Potential: A Programme Plan for Child Well-being 2023-2025 was published last year and is the initial programme plan for the child poverty and well-being programme office in the Department. The programme builds on six focus areas identified by Government which have the potential to bring about significant change for families and children. The role of the Department of the Taoiseach is to co-ordinate and focus Government action. To facilitate this, the office has established a cross-government network on child poverty and well-being. The network has met twice to date, with a further meeting scheduled for quarter 1 of 2024. The programme also envisages a national child poverty and well-being summit in 2024. This will be a pivotal moment to take stock of progress and shape the agenda for future action on child poverty. As well as driving implementation of commitments on the six focus areas, the office will also undertake strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing the efficiency and efficacy of cross-government responses. The first of these was a commitment to assisting children and their families, with a particular focus on those who are experiencing poverty, in budget 2024. The programme office applied a cross-government approach that culminated in the development of the report, Breaking the Cycle: New Measures in Budget 2024 to Reduce Child Poverty and Promote Well-being, which was published on 14 November. The report captures new and increased budget spending by 12 Government Departments and reveals how the new budget focus is accelerating and deepening our collective ambition for children.	spk_105
#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-13	dail	33	Cabinet Committees	dbsect_10	Deputy Boyd Barrett raised the issue of child and family homelessness. Assisting individuals and families facing homelessness is a major focus for the Government and increasing the supply of housing, particularly social housing, is critical in responding to homelessness. We are now seeing record levels of investment being provided through Housing for All. In 2024, more than €5 billion is being provided for the provision of housing and we anticipate more social housing will be provided this year than in any year since the 1970s. Budget 2024 also allocated €242 million specifically for homeless services, including prevention. It will help with provision of emergency accommodation for those who need it, as well as increased prevention activity. Local authorities and their service delivery providers will work closely with all households in emergency accommodation to help them secure an exit to a tenancy. Local authorities have been sanctioned to acquire 1,500 social homes, mainly focused on acquiring properties where a social housing tenant has received a notice of termination and is at risk of homelessness. For private tenants at risk of homelessness who are not in receipt of social housing and do not qualify for it, the cost-rental tenant  Deputy Barry raised an issue relating to a particular childcare service in Cork city. I do not have information to hand on that but I will make inquiries with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman. Deputy McAuliffe referred to the fact that the Cabinet today approved the establishment of the area intervention task force for the Ballymun area. I am delighted that John Costello, formerly of the Dublin county board, has agreed to take that on. It is a really good choice and I am delighted he has agreed to take on the role. I was in touch with him about it today. A dedicated capital budget is being provided to co-fund the task force by central and local government. I agree with the Deputy. I expect public servants and public bodies, whether that is the council, An Garda Síochána, Tusla or others, to engage fully with this body. It has worked well in Drogheda and the north-east inner city. It requires people to come to the table in a meaningful way. They cannot just show up at the meetings but, rather, must show up and then act on what happens at the meetings. We will monitor that closely and make sure it happens in Ballymun. I recognise the Deputy in particular for raising this issue and advocating for the area consistently in the Chamber for the past four years. I am glad this task force is now up and running. I hope it will demonstrate good results on the ground. We are keen to have an enterprise focus to it as well. It is an area of great social deprivation and relatively high unemployment, yet it is surrounded by an area in which there is a huge amount of employment and jobs available. It is important that we have an enterprise focus to this too. Deputy Murnane O'Connor referred to funding for food banks. I think the Department of Social Protection and the fund for European aid to the most deprived, FEAD, which is an EU programme, provides funding for that. I will certainly check that. There are different models, however. Crosscare used to provide a food bank in my area of Blanchardstown but it has gone to a very different model. I met the organisation before Christmas and I was really impressed. It has moved away from the model where people queue up for or come in to receive food or food parcels to a model where it delivers the parcels to the house. That is destigmatising. It also sits down to work individually with each household and that has enabled it to find out in many cases that people have entitlements they have not been claiming or, in some cases, all they needed was help with a particular bill or issue. Once that is done, they are able to go back to buying their groceries and other shopping in the shops, just as we all do. It is important that we have models that enable people to avoid becoming dependent on charity provision. That is a very good model to be considered in other areas too. I echo the Deputy's comments on the need to continue to improve our public services to cope with the rising needs of our society and population. I did not catch everything Deputy Ó Murchú said, but I trust the Garda to make the right decisions on such matters and trust social workers and Tusla to make the right decisions with regard to child protection. Often, they are the only ones who really know what is going on within a family situation and whether taking a child away from a family is the right thing to do. That is always a very big decision to make.	spk_111

Three of those four citizens’ assemblies have now concluded their work and submitted their reports to the Oireachtas. The Dublin Citizens' Assembly concluded its meetings in October 2022 and submitted its report to the Oireachtas in December just gone by. The Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage published its response to the report in December. The Citizens' Assembly on Biodiversity Loss concluded its meetings in January 2023 and submitted its report to the Oireachtas in March 2023. The Oireachtas Committee on the Environment and Climate Action published its response to the report in December 2023. The Minister and officials in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage are now leading on the preparation of a whole-of-government response to the recommendations of both the Dublin Citizens' Assembly and the Citizens' Assembly on Biodiversity Loss, and these responses will be published in due course, once they have been finalised. The Citizens’ Assembly on Drugs Use concluded its meetings in October and submitted its report to the Oireachtas in December. The report was published on 25 January and the Dáil and Seanad will now refer the report to an Oireachtas committee for consideration. I recently met with Paul Reid, the chairman of that assembly, who briefed me on the work done. I thank him and, indeed, all those who took part in the citizens’ assembly and the secretariat for their participation and commitment to the task. The Government will consider the question of further citizens’ assemblies in due course. However, there is an extant commitment for a citizens' assembly on education to begin its work this year.	spk_112
#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-13	dail	33	Cabinet Committees	dbsect_10	I thank the Deputies for their questions. In response to Deputy Ó Murchú, I understand what he is saying about complex and chaotic cases. I have come across them myself but as every case is different, it is difficult to comment without knowing the circumstances. I know the Deputy appreciates that. A number of Deputies raised the Citizens' Assembly on Drugs Use which was discussed at Cabinet today. The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, brought a memo to Cabinet establishing a dedicated committee, which will be made up, if I remember correctly, of 14 members, both Senators and TDs. The Independent Members will be asked to nominate a chairperson because it is their turn in the rotation. We expect it to be up and running next month or certainly no later than April. There are some technicalities around that. The committee is being given seven months to carry out its work and produce a report, but it does not have to take seven months. It could be done more quickly. It was pointed out to me by my staff who were involved in the citizens' assembly and by the chairman, Paul Reid, that because all of the different interest groups and experts appeared before the assembly, it is not necessarily the case that the special committee should have to do that all over again. Ultimately, it is going to be a decision for the members and the Chair as to whether they want to have everyone come in again or whether they would be happy enough to get it done in one day. That is their call, not ours. What I would say in relation to the three takeaways from the report is that the chairman, Paul Reid, was very clear on these things. He said that we should have a dedicated committee and not just refer the report to the health or justice committee because it is about health and justice and a lot more. That is why we decided to go ahead with a dedicated committee. Another takeaway is that we should develop an Irish model that works for Irish circumstances and not try to copy a model from any other jurisdiction. He was also very keen to point out that while the citizens' assembly recommended decriminalisation and a health-led approach, it made many other recommendations as well. He was keen that this not just be about the issue of decriminalisation, how that works and what it would mean, important as that is. Deputy Boyd Barrett spoke about children who are in difficulty needing someone to go to and I know from my visits to schools and from talking to young people in primary and secondary schools that many schools have a school chaplain. In the past, that would have been a religious person but that is now normally not the case; it is a teacher with special training. We have increased the number of guidance counsellors too. I had a chance to visit Foróige services and Jigsaw services which are really good services, where they exist, but I appreciate that it may not be the case that every student in every school has access to the supports he or she needs. On school visits, I do a lot of them too and I have to say when I visit primary and secondary schools around the country I am so impressed with how much education has evolved and now much more interactive it is now than it was when I was in school. There is so much more technology and engagement now. Technology being available to schools is really of huge and crucial importance. I do not know if inspectors talk to students as part of carrying out inspections but I think they should do. If it is not done, it sounds like a good idea. Any time one inspects a service, one would often ask the service users what they think so if that is not done as a matter of course, I would agree with the Deputy that it ought to be done because it is really important to hear the voice of students when it comes to the quality of their education. It is their education in the end. Finally, in response to Deputy O'Sullivan's question on the citizens' assembly on the future of education, we have not taken a decision on the timing of that yet but it is intended that it be done this year.I think we need to have it set up, ideally by the middle of the year. Citizens' assemblies do not fall when the Oireachtas falls, so the election date is not a determinant in that regard, but we would like to have it set up this year. The Minister, Deputy Foley, is working on the terms of reference for that.	spk_117
#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-13	dail	33	Cabinet Committees	dbsect_10	I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 to 25, inclusive, together. The Cabinet committee on children and education oversees the implementation of commitments in the programme for Government in the area of children and education, including further and higher education, with a specific focus on child poverty and well-being. The Cabinet committee provides for a greater focus on improving the lives of all children in Ireland and giving them the best start possible, ensuring every child has the opportunity to fulfil their potential. The Cabinet committee on children and education met twice in 2023 and it is due to meet again shortly.	spk_118
#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-13	dail	33	Cabinet Committees	dbsect_10	I thank Deputies for their questions and contributions. I think we can all agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett that the quality of school buildings varies hugely. I have the privilege from time to time of opening new schools. I am really impressed with the quality of building and facilities but that reminds me how much we need to do to bring the older ones up to standard. Some of our schools are very old indeed. The budget for school building is now more than €1 billion a year. It has increased dramatically but it is clear we will need to increase it some more given rising building costs in particular. I know the Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, are working on that at the moment. I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett on the benefits of additional field trips by students. Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned a number of school projects in County Cork and specifically brought our attention to ASD provision and the need to do more of that, with which I firmly agree. Both Deputies Moynihan and O'Sullivan mentioned the new special schools in Glamire and Carrigaline. There is a relatively new one in my constituency, Danu Community Special School. The Government's preference is still very much for mainstreaming but special schools are needed in certain circumstances. Home tuition is also an option in other circumstances. I agree that we need to prioritise the whole issue of special needs and having a dedicated Minister with a dedicated budget was a good innovation on behalf of this Government, which I hope will continue into the next one. Deputy Dillon raised the issue of special education teacher allocations. I am advised that schools were advised of their allocations on 6 February. There will be 14,600 special education teachers in the forthcoming school year. That is an increase of 1,000 on 2021 and the highest number ever of special education teachers. The allocation model has been in place since 2017. I am told a limited change was made to the method following consultation with unions, management bodies and schools to hear their views on the strengths and shortcomings of the allocation model. It distributes the total available number of posts in line with the school's profile. Of all schools, 67% saw their allocation increase or retained their previous allocation. Of those who saw a decrease, in almost all cases, it was five hours or less. I appreciate that nobody will welcome or want a decrease for the kids attending their school. Deputy Barry raised the industrial relations dispute regarding tutors. This is an industrial relations dispute. I am sure it will be resolved - they always are - if not by negotiation, there is always the option of a referral to the WRC or Labour Court where all arguments can be heard and it can make a recommendation. Deputy Durkan raised the issue of school places in County Kildare, an area that has seen a huge increase in population in recent years. I am advised that in County Kildare, there are 3,500 junior infant pupils and that 4,000 first enrol every year. Enrolment pressures can be driven in some cases by duplication of applications, applications from outside the area and parental or student choice. In the majority of areas, including across most of County Kildare, there are sufficient places available to meet the needs of children in the area. The Government has invested more than €250 million in new school infrastructure in County Kildare. While some applicants may not have received an offer of a school place yet for 2024-25, families can be assured that all children in an area who require a school place will be provided with one. The Government and the Minister are happy to give the assurance to the Deputy that will be the case. We are working with schools and patrons to ensure there are sufficient places available and that everyone has a place for September next year.	spk_133
#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-13	dail	33	Departmental Programmes	dbsect_11	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 7, inclusive, together. The work of the child poverty and well-being programme office is to prioritise action across government in areas that will have the greatest effect for children and families experiencing poverty. From Poverty to Potential: A Programme Plan for Child Well-being 2023-2025 was published last year and is the initial programme plan for the child poverty and well-being programme office in the Department. The programme builds on six focus areas identified by Government which have the potential to bring about significant change for families and children. The role of the Department of the Taoiseach is to co-ordinate and focus Government action. To facilitate this, the office has established a cross-government network on child poverty and well-being. The network has met twice to date, with a further meeting scheduled for quarter 1 of 2024. The programme also envisages a national child poverty and well-being summit in 2024. This will be a pivotal moment to take stock of progress and shape the agenda for future action on child poverty. As well as driving implementation of commitments on the six focus areas, the office will also undertake strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing the efficiency and efficacy of cross-government responses. The first of these was a commitment to assisting children and their families, with a particular focus on those who are experiencing poverty, in budget 2024. The programme office applied a cross-government approach that culminated in the development of the report, Breaking the Cycle: New Measures in Budget 2024 to Reduce Child Poverty and Promote Well-being, which was published on 14 November. The report captures new and increased budget spending by 12 Government Departments and reveals how the new budget focus is accelerating and deepening our collective ambition for children.	spk_105
#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-13	dail	33	Departmental Programmes	dbsect_11	Deputy Boyd Barrett raised the issue of child and family homelessness. Assisting individuals and families facing homelessness is a major focus for the Government and increasing the supply of housing, particularly social housing, is critical in responding to homelessness. We are now seeing record levels of investment being provided through Housing for All. In 2024, more than €5 billion is being provided for the provision of housing and we anticipate more social housing will be provided this year than in any year since the 1970s. Budget 2024 also allocated €242 million specifically for homeless services, including prevention. It will help with provision of emergency accommodation for those who need it, as well as increased prevention activity. Local authorities and their service delivery providers will work closely with all households in emergency accommodation to help them secure an exit to a tenancy. Local authorities have been sanctioned to acquire 1,500 social homes, mainly focused on acquiring properties where a social housing tenant has received a notice of termination and is at risk of homelessness. For private tenants at risk of homelessness who are not in receipt of social housing and do not qualify for it, the cost-rental tenant  Deputy Barry raised an issue relating to a particular childcare service in Cork city. I do not have information to hand on that but I will make inquiries with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman. Deputy McAuliffe referred to the fact that the Cabinet today approved the establishment of the area intervention task force for the Ballymun area. I am delighted that John Costello, formerly of the Dublin county board, has agreed to take that on. It is a really good choice and I am delighted he has agreed to take on the role. I was in touch with him about it today. A dedicated capital budget is being provided to co-fund the task force by central and local government. I agree with the Deputy. I expect public servants and public bodies, whether that is the council, An Garda Síochána, Tusla or others, to engage fully with this body. It has worked well in Drogheda and the north-east inner city. It requires people to come to the table in a meaningful way. They cannot just show up at the meetings but, rather, must show up and then act on what happens at the meetings. We will monitor that closely and make sure it happens in Ballymun. I recognise the Deputy in particular for raising this issue and advocating for the area consistently in the Chamber for the past four years. I am glad this task force is now up and running. I hope it will demonstrate good results on the ground. We are keen to have an enterprise focus to it as well. It is an area of great social deprivation and relatively high unemployment, yet it is surrounded by an area in which there is a huge amount of employment and jobs available. It is important that we have an enterprise focus to this too. Deputy Murnane O'Connor referred to funding for food banks. I think the Department of Social Protection and the fund for European aid to the most deprived, FEAD, which is an EU programme, provides funding for that. I will certainly check that. There are different models, however. Crosscare used to provide a food bank in my area of Blanchardstown but it has gone to a very different model. I met the organisation before Christmas and I was really impressed. It has moved away from the model where people queue up for or come in to receive food or food parcels to a model where it delivers the parcels to the house. That is destigmatising. It also sits down to work individually with each household and that has enabled it to find out in many cases that people have entitlements they have not been claiming or, in some cases, all they needed was help with a particular bill or issue. Once that is done, they are able to go back to buying their groceries and other shopping in the shops, just as we all do. It is important that we have models that enable people to avoid becoming dependent on charity provision. That is a very good model to be considered in other areas too. I echo the Deputy's comments on the need to continue to improve our public services to cope with the rising needs of our society and population. I did not catch everything Deputy Ó Murchú said, but I trust the Garda to make the right decisions on such matters and trust social workers and Tusla to make the right decisions with regard to child protection. Often, they are the only ones who really know what is going on within a family situation and whether taking a child away from a family is the right thing to do. That is always a very big decision to make.	spk_111

#LeoVaradkar	2024-02-07	dail	33	Death of Former Taoiseach: Expressions of Sympathy	dbsect_3	"A Cheann Comhairle, mar Thaoiseach agus mar Cheannaire Fhine Gael, déanaim comhbhrón ó chroí le teaghlach, cairde agus comhghleacaithe John Bruton. Molaim tírghráthóir a chaith saol seirbhíse poiblí iontach. Chuir sé go buan lenár dtír agus d'fhág sé oidhreacht shuntasach. As Taoiseach and as leader of Fine Gael, I extend my deepest sympathy to the family, friends and colleagues of John Bruton. I pay tribute to a modern patriot who led a life of extraordinary public service. He made lasting contributions to our country and leaves a remarkable legacy. John Bruton was somebody who inspired me to enter politics and to join Fine Gael. I was struck by his incredible belief in young people and his unshakeable faith that they could make a difference. He never forgot what it was like to enter this House as a young man, only 22 years old at the time, full of hope and idealism. He was still hopeful and idealistic 35 years later when he left Irish political life so he could make a vital contribution on the world stage as EU ambassador to the United States. In the years in between, he helped to make this country a better place. He had a vision of how to fix problems and he brought a long-term plan for the nation perspective to his work as a TD, a Parliamentary Secretary, a Minister in some of the toughest Departments and especially as Taoiseach. As Minister for Finance in the 1980s, he started the difficult job of repairing our public finances. As Minister for Industry and Energy, he overhauled Irish company law and provided the means for economic growth by enacting new industrial development legislation. As Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism, he created new opportunities for Irish business and helped to open our country and economy to the world. But as Taoiseach, John Bruton changed our country forever and for the better. His knowledge, understanding and deep love of history shone through and helped to guide him as he worked to create a fairer, more peaceful and more prosperous future for us all. As Taoiseach between 1994 and 1997, John Bruton led a partnership Government – a rainbow coalition with Labour and Democratic Left – that set our country on a path to peace and prosperity. Before he took office, economic growth was slow and stuttered. Thanks to the policies of the rainbow Government, it took off spectacularly in a strong and sustainable way. I believe he helped to lay the foundations for much of the economic prosperity we enjoy today. It is probably no surprise to those of us who knew him well that he called his collections of essays and articles  He met with then Prince Charles, now King Charles III, in Dublin, the first official visit of a member of the British royal family since independence. Some people mocked that and others boycotted it. In later years that followed, they followed his lead. It was an important act of reconciliation and helped pave the way for the official visit of Queen Elizabeth some 16 years later. John Bruton had faith in politics and faith in people and was a man of deep personal faith and conviction. He made a crucial radio address to the Irish people in the days leading up to the divorce referendum in 1995 calling for a ""Yes"" vote. I remember it well. He spoke from the heart as he reminded listeners that ""the essence of Christianity ... is the virtue of charity"". It was precisely because of his faith that he understood the power of forgiveness and the importance of compassion, and that shone through. I believe it convinced many people who were wavering to vote ""Yes"", and I think the country might not be the modern society it is today had that referendum been lost. I genuinely believe that the sincerity of his appeal, from someone whose sincerity could never be doubted, was crucial that week. In September 1996, John Bruton was invited to speak before a joint session of the US Congress, a rare honour for European Heads of Government. He made a powerful plea for peace and reconciliation on our island. ""Never again"", he said, a sentiment which continues to inspire all of us today. The solution to the Troubles and so many other problems on our island, he believed, was learning to live with difference. John Bruton helped teach us the importance of living with difference, whether it was with those who had a different religion or political viewpoint or those with different personal circumstances and beliefs. He was a Christian Democrat in the European tradition, who led with compassion and, in doing so, helped to make Ireland a better and fairer place. I believe the rainbow coalition of 1994 to 1997 was one of our finest governments, but, as we know, it was not returned in the general election. Fine Gael increased its number of seats by nine but it was not enough to form a coalition. John remained on as leader of the party for another four years but he was never Taoiseach again. Despite the way things ended, however, he never lost his faith in politics. While his public persona was often intellectual and serious, as a person he was always good company, funny, witty, gregarious, sociable, self-deprecating, and with a distinctive and infectious laugh. He continued to radiate optimism and confidence and continued to inspire those around him as he worked to improve the lives of others. As vice-president of the European People's Party, he spoke around the world on European and Irish economic and political developments. He also helped draft the proposed European constitution which was signed in Rome in October 2004. I remember well meeting him when I was a youth delegate to that convention. He was a respected voice on the world stage and was asked later that year to leave politics in Ireland to become the European Union's ambassador to the United States. He accepted because he knew he could make a difference and he always had more to offer. He helped explain to everyone, from the President, to Congress, to local school groups and students, the importance of free trade, free enterprise and multilateralism for all our countries, as well as the Euro-Atlantic partnership. I will never forget having dinner with him and Finola in his residence in Washington DC, nor the fact that he found time to do so with two young councillors who happened to be visiting town. Always persuasive, he showed how the EU benefited the US economy and security and was good for American jobs, and it was a hugely successful five-year term. When he came back to Ireland, he continued to be an influential and courageous voice on subjects that meant the most to him, whether that was historical commemorations or the threat posed by Brexit. He put people before politics and principle before party. A few months after the Brexit referendum, he joined with former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and spoke before the House of Lords committee in Britain about the impact Brexit could have on Ireland and how dangerous it was that Northern Ireland had not been considered properly when the matter was being voted on. He was active to the end, a patriot who was guided by a love of country, not fear or hatred of others. He wanted the best for Ireland and he did so much to make this a better country. My condolences to his beloved wife, Finola, their children, Juliana, Emily, Mary-Elizabeth and Matthew, their grandchildren and all their family and friends.Special mention must be made of his brother, Richard, and sister, Mary. For a family to contribute one remarkable politician to Irish politics is impressive, but to contribute two is extraordinary. In many ways, the Bruton family exemplify all that is best about Irish politics. Their belief in public service and ideas in making a difference is as great a legacy as all they contributed in terms of policy and legislation. John Bruton will always be remembered for his service to our country. He had faith in politics to make a difference, and he was right. Today we let his family know that his faith was not misplaced. All of us, on all political sides, will continue to fight for what we believe is just and right, even if we do not always agree. We will work to make Ireland a better, more prosperous and fairer place, seek to advance the cause of peace and reconciliation on our island and keep Ireland's place at the heart of Europe. That is the legacy of John Bruton, and we will make it ours, too. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam uasal agus dílis. Slán agus beannacht, a sheanchara."	spk_4
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-30	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I do not have those numbers available yet but I think they will be available in the next couple of weeks. I want to acknowledge that rents are very high for far too many people in this country and that a lot of people are waiting far too long to be in a position to buy their own home. This is something that the Government is helping with. The rent credit, for example, is worth €750 per renter per year, this year. It was worth €500 per year last year. Many people are claiming that and it is helping them with the rent. We also have the new form of cost-rental housing. This is a form of public housing that allows people to rent at more affordable rates. That is really taking off now and is proving to be very popular. We will see a lot more of that being built around the country in the coming years. When it comes to first-time buyers, we are helping them with schemes that the Deputy wants to abolish, like the help-to-buy scheme, and the first home scheme. That is making a huge difference. We saw figures come out only in the last couple of days, which show that the number of first-time buyers drawing down their first mortgage is at its highest level since 2007. That is an extraordinary change from where we were only a few years ago. In 2007, I was in my 20s. We are actually back to that now. Those are the kind of numbers that we are now seeing of people buying their first homes, which is really encouraging. We have also seen a big uptick in the number of new homes being built. More than 33,000 new homes were built last year. That does not include derelict homes brought back into use or student accommodation. We are now seeing numbers that we have not seen in 15 years, in terms of new homes being built, and first-time buyers at a level that I have not seen since I was in my late 20s. That is really encouraging but of course I acknowledge that we are catching up on a period where that was not the case and we have a big deficit yet to close against the backdrop of a rising population. I do need to mention two things the Deputy said because it is important in this House that we are honest and accurate on the issue of housing. This a sensitive issue and many people are hurting. They do not need misinformation from the Opposition or from any other quarter. The Deputy said that a couple must earn €127,00 per year to buy a new house in Dublin. That creates a false impression. First, the particular survey the Deputy referred to refers three-bedroom homes only and to new homes only. Most first-time buyers do not buy new homes. They buy second-hand homes for the obvious reason that they are less expensive. Many first-time buyers buy two-bed homes, not three-bed. The Deputy is picking a particular example with three different caveats and then trying to make out that is the case for everyone when he knows it is not. The survey also made the assumption that people can only borrow 3.3 times their income. The Deputy knows that is not the case anymore. It also did not take into account the Government's first home scheme, which closes the affordability gap for so many people. The Deputy created a false impression and he should not do so. Quite frankly, he should not have to do so.  The Deputy pushed the narrative that enormous numbers of young Irish people are leaving Ireland to go overseas because of the housing crisis and that this is a one-way street. We know of course that is not a one-way street. While 80,000 Irish citizens left to live abroad for many different reasons in the past three years, 90,000 came back. We know that if we look at places like Australia and cities like Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra, the ratios of house prices to income are much the same as they are in Ireland.	spk_2
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-30	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	The statement the Deputy made earlier was not correct because he did not take account of the first home scheme. The whole point of the scheme established by the Government is to close the affordability gap, where there is a gap between what a new house costs to buy and what a person can get in a mortgage. If we take into account the first home scheme, which thousands of people are now using and which Sinn Féin wants to abolish, it is possible for couple on an income below €127,000 to buy those homes mentioned by the Deputy. It is even there in the survey if he chooses to read it. There is a little asterisk that notes it does not take account of the first home scheme. People all over the country are now using the scheme to buy new homes and it is wrong that Sinn Féin and the left want to abolish it and take that opportunity away from first-time buyers. On our housing targets, more than 30,000 new homes were built last year, the highest number in 15 years. Some 500 first-time buyers are drawing down mortgages per week, the most we have seen since I was in my late 20s. That is what we are seeing in the market. There is more social housing than in any year since the 1970s. We do not have exact figures for cost-rental and affordable houses yet but we will and I am sure there will be more of them than in the previous year.	spk_5
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-30	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I join Deputies Bacik and Doherty in welcoming the news earlier this morning that the DUP is willing to re-enter power-sharing in Northern Ireland. This paves the way for democratic and devolved government to be restored, for the assembly to function and for the executive to meet and make decisions for Northern Ireland. Crucially, it will also allow the North-South bodies, including the North-South Ministerial Council, to work again. Many of the problems people face in Northern Ireland are very similar to those we face here and it is important that they have a democratic and devolved government up and running to deal with those very real issues. I had a chance to speak with the UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak earlier today. He briefed me on the situation and we agreed to continue to work together on issues of mutual interest and mutual concern such as this. It is hoped that we can have the institutions up and running and the necessary legislation passed in Westminster before 8 February. It is very positive that as we enter the spring, there is new hope that the Good Friday Agreement can work again. I think we will all agree that this would be very desirable. Once again, I appreciate that a lot of people are suffering because of the housing crisis and that this manifests itself in different ways, including renters paying rents that are too high or having a bad experience with their landlords, but we are making progress and we are helping. As I mentioned earlier, 33,000 new homes were built last year, which is the highest number in 15 years, and 500 first-time buyers are drawing down their first mortgage every week. We have not seen this since 2007 when I was in my late twenties. That is how much it has changed in the past couple of years and how much progress we are making. We are also seeing dereliction and vacancy rates falling, in part because of the actions this Government has taken.  Regarding the matters raised by the Deputy, for obvious reasons, I do not want to go into individual cases when I do not know all the details and I do not want to say anything that might jeopardise prosecutions or enforcement actions that are under way. In terms of what we can do to help renters, we have brought in the rent tax credit, which is putting a month's rent back into the pockets of average renters. We have brought in new laws to extend the terms people are given such as the notice to quit time period so people can have more time to find a new home if they need to. We are also dramatically expanding cost rental, which is a new form of affordable housing and a new form of public housing where the Government in partnership with others provides properties that people can rent at affordable rates where they do not qualify for social housing. We are going to continue to build on that in the years ahead. We are always open to considering ideas and recommendations from other parties as to how we can strengthen renters' rights but we need to make sure that we get the balance right.	spk_8
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-30	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	We are always happy to consider proposals for new laws and regulations but any time we consider a new law or regulation, we must always consider the unintended consequences.We have seen that play out so many times. When renters are surveyed, as the Deputy will know from the recently published survey, approximately 80% say they have a favourable experience. That still leaves 20% with a bad experience. That is a lot of people when you consider the number of people who are renting. What we want to do with the RTB, in particular, is make sure it is better at enforcing the laws that already exist. That works both ways. I meet lots of renters who are annoyed with the RTB for not enforcing the laws that exist already. I also meet landlords who have not received rent for months, whose properties have been damaged and who do not believe the RTB is working in their favour. We need to make sure that organisation is properly resourced and staffed and has the right IT systems so it can enforce existing laws. That is something I know the Minister is working hard on.	spk_10
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-30	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I thank Deputy Nolan for raising this important issue. Everyone in the House can agree that we need to do all we can to ensure people with disabilities have independence and freedom and can take up employment, use a car, travel and do all of things we and they need to do. I do not have an up-to-date note on the primary medical certificate, but I will get more information for the Deputy as soon as I can. I know the Minister of Finance is seized of the matter. He has appointed new board members, as the Deputy mentioned, and is trying to get through the backlog of cases that need to be considered.Of course, we can review the criteria to see if we can include more people. It is never an easy thing to do because no matter what the criteria or the rules are, there will always be people who do not qualify, no matter what scheme we set up. I take the Deputy's point that in some cases the rules are too harsh and perhaps being enforced too strictly. I will certainly discuss that with the Minister, Deputy McGrath.	spk_12

#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-30	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. I know he has raised it before in the Dáil. It is a very distressing situation for people living and earning their livelihood around Lough Funshinagh. I have not had the chance to visit but am familiar with the area and it has been raised with me personally by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, and Senator Dolan. The Minister of State, the OPW and Roscommon County Council are working to find a resolution to the issue. Temporary defences will be deployed in the interim. The Minister of State plans to meet with the Lough Funshinagh flood crisis committee on Thursday. Since the beginning of January, the level of the lough has risen by about 300 mm, giving an average daily rate of rise of about 1 cm. The level of the lough is presently 325 mm below the road level in some areas. The lough, if it continues to rise at this rate, could overtop the road and inundate properties in less than a month's time. To mitigate the risk of that, Roscommon County Council plans to employ temporary defences along the top of the road. This work will likely need to commence in the next one to two weeks. In advance of the work starting, it will be necessary for the families in at least two properties to vacate their homes until such time as the lake levels are lower. The timescale is difficult to predict but could be of the order of four months. Officials from the council have already engaged with these families and will help them in any way they can.	spk_16

On many of these issues, such as housing affordability and gardaí, we regularly have discussions in the House. We would be happy to have statements on Northern Ireland, perhaps next week when the position is more clear and the documentation is published. The Whip will be happy to organise that. The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, is willing to have statements and a question-and-answer session on the fishing negotiations once that can be scheduled. I would be happy to find some time for statements on Dublin as well, but these are best scheduled by the Business Committee rather than here on the floor of the House.

#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-30	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	Ireland welcomes the decision by the International Court of Justice to order provisional measures in the South Africa versus Israel case. The court’s order is significant, that Israel must ensure that its military does not commit actions prohibited under the Genocide Convention and takes immediate and effective measures to enable basic services and humanitarian assistance in Gaza. The court’s order is legally binding and final and Israel must urgently implement all provisional measures. We have also called for humanitarian access and the protection of civilians since the start of the conflict. It is important to point out that the court did not made any findings of genocide against Israel but did say that South Africa has a relevant case that can be considered. We are now taking a rigorous analysis of this matter. Our understanding from our initial legal advice is that the term “join” is not the correct one to use. We can make an intervention, either a section 62 intervention or a section 63 intervention and these are different matters but we cannot actually do so until South Africa has submitted its main case, or memorial, and it has told us it will not be doing that for three to four months.	spk_46
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-30	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputy. To be clear, as a Government we will not accept any displacement of the Palestinian people from Gaza or any attempts to resettle Gaza or the permanent reoccupation of Gaza. What we are now working towards with our international partners is a ceasefire; one that can allow humanitarian aid in, that can allow the hostages to be released, which is crucial, that can allow the killing to stop and that, crucially, can allow us to talk about the day after in Gaza when Hamas is no longer in charge and when we can begin the reconstruction of that territory.	spk_48
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-30	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputy. I am not in favour of tax amnesties and I am surprised to hear him advocating them. I thought it was something he was against. The law is clear. People have to pay the TV licence and I encourage people to pay the TV licence, not just because of the law but because of funds. It is really important to have public service broadcasting including the news, current affairs, children's programmes and Irish-language programming. While most of the money goes to RTÉ, it does not all go to RTÉ as it goes to other media outlets as well. That said, it is an outdated charge. It belongs to a different time and I am keen that we agree this year on a new mechanism to fund public service broadcasting, provide for that this year and have it in place for 2025.	spk_52

#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-30	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	It is a very serious matter. Even if it is a small number of staff in a very big agency, it is shocking to think that UN staff could be involved in any form of terrorist attack. It does need to be investigated thoroughly. We have taken the decision, however, not to suspend our funding to the agency. The people of Palestine need humanitarian aid, healthcare, and education and it would be a disproportionate response to suspend our funding. For that reason, we are among a number of countries, perhaps even one of the first countries, to say that we will continue to fund the agency. We are providing €36 million this year to help Palestinians, of which €18 million goes to UNRWA. We have confidence in Philippe Lazzarini to immediately terminate the contracts of the small number of employees suspected of involvement in terrorism.	spk_64

#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-30	dail	33	Cabinet Committees	dbsect_5	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 12, inclusive, together. The Cabinet committee on health last met on 7 December 2023 and is currently scheduled to next meet on 12 February of this year. The committee oversees the programme for Government commitments relating to health and receives detailed reports on identified policy areas. It considers the progress of health reforms, including Sláintecare and the reform of disability services. The committee also maintains an overview of public health. In addition to the meetings of the full Cabinet and Cabinet committees, I meet Ministers from time to time on an individual basis to focus on different issues. I meet regularly with the Minister for Health to discuss progress and challenges in health, including the Sláintecare reform programme. Sláintecare, which is happening with the support and oversight of the Department of the Taoiseach through the Cabinet committee on health, is about four main issues: making healthcare more affordable; making it more accessible; ensuring better outcomes for patients; and reforming our health service. We are committed to expanding the core capacity of our acute hospitals, with more health professionals and more acute hospital beds.We have added more than 1,000 permanent beds in our acute hospitals since 2020 and 1,000 more consultants. We have increased the total public health sector workforce by more than 26,000 since the start of 2020. That includes an extra 8,000 nurses and midwives, an extra 4,000 social care professionals and almost 3,000 extra doctors and dentists. There is a strong pipeline of capital projects, including several new hospital projects and significant new facilities for existing hospitals. Our multi-annual approach to waiting lists resulted in an overall reduction in the number of patients waiting more than ten to 12 weeks by 27% since the numbers peaked after the pandemic. Waiting lists fell last year for the second year in a row. We are determined to make sure they fall for the third year in a row this year. The figures that matter most are the number of patients waiting the longest, that is, those waiting longer than the ten to 12 weeks recommended by the Sláintecare report. The target of achieving a 10% reduction in patients waiting longer than ten to 12 weeks was met, with an 11% reduction achieved. This covers inpatients, day cases, outpatients and patients undergoing gastrointestinal, GI, scopes, and equates to 57,000 fewer people waiting more than ten to 12 weeks. The enhanced community care programme continues to improve healthcare at a more local level and to alleviate pressure on major hospitals. The majority of community healthcare networks, community intervention teams and community support teams are now in place and providing care closer to home. Work is ongoing on the reconfiguration of the HSE organisational structures into six new health regions and the establishment of elective care centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway, as well as surgical hubs in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford in the interim. At a time when the cost-of-living crisis is affecting everyone, we are making healthcare more affordable through the removal of hospital charges, widened eligibility for the GP card and a reduced drug payment scheme threshold, among other measures. We have allocated more than €22.8 billion for health services in 2024. That will facilitate the continued provision and expansion of quality, affordable healthcare services. Separately, significant funding is also being invested in disability services. Budget 2024 will provide for the further expansion of free contraception provision to include women aged 31; just under €3 million for the development of child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, with the creation of 68 new posts; the first full-year programme of publicly funded assisted human reproduction services, including IVF; more than €20 million for residential placements for children and adults; €15 million for respite services, €18.2 million for day services; and €8.5 million for developments in children's services, including new therapy assistant positions. Our health service has its challenges but it is responding and it has expanded dramatically in recent years. We are treating more people with better outcomes than ever before. Our life expectancy is continuing to increase and is now well above international averages, being in the top five in the European Union. We continue to reduce mortality rates for stroke and certain cancers and to report ever-increasing positive trends in preventative health.	spk_96
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-30	dail	33	Cabinet Committees	dbsect_5	I thank the Deputies for their questions. Deputy Durkan raised the operation and layout of emergency departments. I very much agree with him that staff work very hard in emergency departments and are often subject to abuse and even violence from a minority of patients and their visitors and that is never acceptable. The NTPF is used to commission private healthcare for public patients and it generally works very well. However, patients do have the right to seek healthcare in Northern Ireland or in the EU and have the costs reimbursed. Ultimately, it is their choice. It would be better to use the capacity we have here in our private sector rather than people going abroad but they have that right under EU law. We also have an arrangement with Northern Ireland and people avail of that, particularly for cataracts. Regarding the recruitment freeze and embargo, provision has been made for the HSE to increase its staff this year. It can hire an additional 2,000 staff. Since 2020, we have seen a recruitment surge. We have 8,000 more nurses and midwives than we had in 2020 and there are 3,000 more doctors and dentists. The HSE can hire an additional 2,000 staff but it needs to be done in a proper way. Deputies Moynihan and Murphy asked about drugs policy. I met the chairman of the Citizens' Assembly on Drug Use last week. There were three takeaways for me from what he said. The first is that we need an Irish model; we should not just try to copy models in other countries. The assembly has made a lot of recommendations and it is not just about decriminalisation. He does not want all the focus to be on that. If it is going to be examined by an Oireachtas committee, it should be a special committee, not the health or justice committees because it is relevant to both areas and indeed other areas like education. Our intention is to refer the report to a special Oireachtas committee. The Minister, Deputy Naughton, will bring a memo to Cabinet about that next week. One of the issues the special Oireachtas committee will have to tease is what decriminalisation really means in Ireland in a legal context. Does it mean that is not an offence at all? Does it meant that it is a non-indictable offence? Does it mean that it is an offence without a penalty? Is there something like penalty points or does it actually mean that a certain amount of each particular substance would not be illegal to possess? All of this has to be teased out by the committee. It was not teased out by the assembly. In fairness to the members, they are not legal experts or legislators. With that in mind, we are proposing a timed amendment of nine months to the Private Members' Bill. Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned a particular medication or cream that I am not familiar with. I do not know why it was taken off the GMS and the DPS. There may well be a good reason and there may not be. If the Deputy can pass me a note with the name of the medicine, I will check up on it because I am sure the issue will come up again. Deputy Tóibín asked about access to GP services. We have increased the number of training places dramatically. There are now more doctors qualifying as GPs than there are retiring. It does not take six, seven or eight years. If people train as a GP, in their third year of training they are in practice almost full time, seeing patients. We are seeing those people come through already. We are allowing GPs to come in from other jurisdictions and South Africa in particular. This is because it is an international labour market and people come and go. We are also investing in more practice nurses because in Ireland there is a very low ratio of nurses to GPs. In an Irish general practice, there might be one nurse to four doctors. In a general practice in Holland, there will usually be four nurses and four doctors. That model works very well, so they are the things we are doing. Ozempic is a medicine used both for diabetes and obesity. We should not forget that obesity is a disease. It is good that treatments are now available for it. However, there is a shortfall of supply internationally and for that reason, and rightly so, diabetic patients are being prioritised. The company, Novo Nordisk, is scaling up production, but thinks that it will be the latter part of the year before enough is being produced to meet demand. Finally, to Deputy O'Sullivan's question, I will check up on the heel prick test. I do not know what the current status of the review is. I know we test for many more things than we used to. It used to be just four and now it is approximately 60. I am not exactly sure where we are on that but I will follow up on it. I also want to recognise Deputy's advocacy when it comes to new medicines and rare diseases. As part of the Revised Estimates Volume just before Christmas, we set aside dedicated funding for new medicines for this year. Hopefully, that will see more new medicines and more new uses being approved throughout 2024.	spk_105

The committee works to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the implementation of Housing for All and programme for Government commitments regarding housing and related matters. Our latest update on progress achieved under Housing for All was published last Thursday. Despite considerable challenges in the external environment, we are making real progress with new homes and apartments being built all over the country.  Last week, data released by the CSO confirmed that more houses were built last year than in any year since 2008. That is a 15-year high. With more than 32,000 new homes, our target for 2023 has been exceeded. We are confident that this strong momentum will continue, with building under way on almost 33,000 new homes last year, which is up 20% on the previous year. Planning permission data also indicates a strong pipeline, with permission granted for more than 37,600 new homes in the year to the end of September 2023.  Affordability initiatives are having a real impact in helping people to achieve home ownership, with more than 500 first-time buyers or couples drawing down their mortgage each week. This is the highest since 2007.Almost 2,500 couples and individuals availed of the first home scheme in 2023, while in the 11 months to the end of November 2003, almost 7,000 claimed the help-to-buy scheme to assist with the deposit needed to purchase or build a new home. These schemes will assist thousands more to buy this year. We are also seeing the benefit of recent measures to bring vacant and derelict homes back into use, with just over 3,000 applications approved for the vacant property refurbishment grant. On State lands, building started on a number of sites during the final months of 2023. This includes almost 2,000 new homes in the Dublin City Council area and over 200 new social and affordable homes at the former Devoy Barracks in Naas. We are also committed to improving the rental market by providing greater security, affordability and viability to tenants and landlords into the future. In addition to the increased rent tax credit, recent measures to bring about more homes to rent include further reform of the fair deal scheme and the Government's new policy to develop more on-campus student accommodation. Housing for All is working. We are building more homes and we need to press ahead with implementation and maintain this strong momentum into 2024 and beyond.	spk_108
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-30	dail	33	Cabinet Committees	dbsect_5	Deputy Durkan raised the issue of institutional investors. The Government recognises the need for protections to prevent institutional investors displacing owner occupiers. For this reason, we introduced tax and planning changes to protect traditional family houses from bulk purchase. These include changes introduced in May 2021 to the rate of stamp duty on bulk purchases. A 10% stamp duty levy was introduced by Government for the cumulative purchase of ten or more residential houses in a 12-month period. Section 28 guidelines for planning authorities provide for an owner occupier guarantee preventing multiple units being sold to a single buyer in new estates, although, of course, this does not apply retrospectively to permissions granted before 2021. About 40,000 homes have received planning permission with conditions attached prohibiting bulk purchase or multiple sale to a single purchaser since that law was brought in and we are considering further measures. We believe the role of institutional investors is to finance new housing developments that otherwise would not be built, not to buy up existing ones when people have a legitimate expectation that they may be able to buy them themselves. Deputy Dillon raised the issue of affordable housing schemes in Mayo. I agree that we need a mix of affordable housing schemes and social housing schemes. It should not just be social housing. The argument made in the past was that counties where affordability is better than others do not need these schemes. I do not agree with that view. I think every county should have at least one scheme but I would also point out that there are ways other than affordable housing schemes to achieve affordability. Help to buy does it by helping people to afford a deposit and the first home scheme can close the gap between what somebody gets in terms of mortgage approval and the cost of building a new home. There are lots of ways we can achieve affordability. Social housing is clearly one way. As I said before, it benefits everyone. It takes people off the housing list, frees up properties for other people to rent and has a downward dampening effect on house prices. That is why we are building more social housing now than at any point since the 1970s. The Deputy may be interested to know that if we compare the 2022 census with the census ten years ago, we find that there are 40,000 more families on social housing than was the case back in 2011 and the percentage of people living in social housing is now higher than it was ten years ago. That shows how committed this Government and previous Governments in the past ten years have been to social housing. We are also trying to reduce the cost of building homes by waiving development levies, servicing more land, reducing the cost of finance and focusing on vacancy and help to buy. Let us never forget what help to buy is. This is tax that people have already paid. It is their own tax they are getting back and they can put it towards their deposit. It would be terrible if that was taken away. Regarding the Vienna model, Vienna is a great city. I have been there many times and I love the place but there are merits and demerits to its housing model. One of the things people in Vienna tell me is that because there is such a focus on public housing, it is very hard to own your own home in Vienna. Home ownership rates in Austria are among the lowest in Europe and are lower than they are in Ireland. I am not sure if that is the model people want in Ireland, one where people are less likely to own their own home and are in public housing for life no matter how good and secure it may be. I think we all appreciate that there will always be some level of vacancy but there is still too much of it. It is still too common even though vacancy rates are falling. I agree with Deputy Barry that local authorities need to be more assertive and proactive in what they do regarding vacancy. Some are better than others. Waterford is a very good example of a local authority that is particularly active when it comes to vacancy and other local authorities could learn from that. The Government is adopting a carrot-and-stick approach. A figure of €150 million is available to local authorities to purchase derelict properties and bring them back into use. They can buy the property, sell it on and use the money again to buy another property. I am really encouraging local authorities to do that. They have compulsory purchase order powers that are not used enough. There is the derelict site levy, which they are often too slow to impose, and there is the vacant property tax. Grants are now available to individuals to renovate properties and bring them back into use. Over 3,000 of those have been approved and the drawdown is picking up. Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan raised the issue of a social housing passport. I will have to come back to him on that issue. It is a good idea, particularly where people are moving back to their own county, that they would carry their years with them. One thing we would need to guard against is people being on multiple lists because it could create all sorts of difficulties if people are on housing lists in several different local authorities. I do not have any information for Deputy Tóibín regarding the issue he raised concerning the Land Registry. There are, however, lots of options available to people who are still in financial distress from the crash 12 or 13 years ago. Mortgage to rent is one option while personal insolvency is another option. I would say to anyone to get good legal and financial advice on their options. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, made a statement on the housing adaptation grant earlier in the Dáil today. That is probably a more up-to-date response than I can give.	spk_117
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-30	dail	33	Cabinet Committees	dbsect_5	I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 to 27, inclusive, together. The Government has established ten Cabinet committees. These are Brexit and Northern Ireland, children and education, economy and investment, environment and climate change, EU and international affairs, Government co-ordination, health, housing, humanitarian response to Ukraine, and social affairs and public services. I am a member of all committees, as are the Tánaiste and the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ryan. That is an awful lot of committees, so if anybody has a new committee or task force they think I should chair, I would appreciate suggestions on ones I should stop chairing.	spk_118
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-30	dail	33	Cabinet Committees	dbsect_5	On the St. Patrick's Day events in the White House, I have not yet received an invitation. If I am invited, I will accept and, as always, use it as an opportunity to speak to the US President and Administration about matters of interest and concern to the Irish people. Those conversations are not always pleasant ones. While we agree on the majority of things, we do not agree on everything. I point out that the President of Palestine, Mahmoud Abbas, has met President Biden in the past few months, and certainly more recently than I have met him. I do not think the President of Palestine would refuse an invitation to go to the White House to discuss matters happening in Gaza and elsewhere. I do not see why we would do so, on that basis. With regard to the International Court of Justice, we support and accept the rulings it has made in recent weeks. We believe Israel must now implement those and protect civilian life. It is important to clarify that the ICJ has not found that Israel has committed genocide, nor has it called for ceasefire - we have. It has found that South Africa has a valid and plausible case to make. South Africa informs us it is preparing the case. It could be between three and four months before that case is ready to submit. At that point, it will be possible for us to make an intervention, either under section 62 or section 63. These are different types of intervention. It is not a matter of joining the case. That is a misnomer. It is not like signing a petition or liking a tweet. It is much more complicated than that. We would have to look at it carefully and in detail. We also need to bear in mind that there is no guarantee that the ICJ will find Israel guilty of genocide in two or three years' time. We need to make sure we are not on the wrong side of the law and the facts on this.	spk_123
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-30	dail	33	Cabinet Committees	dbsect_5	Of course. We are getting our own legal advice.	spk_125
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-30	dail	33	Cabinet Committees	dbsect_6	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 12, inclusive, together. The Cabinet committee on health last met on 7 December 2023 and is currently scheduled to next meet on 12 February of this year. The committee oversees the programme for Government commitments relating to health and receives detailed reports on identified policy areas. It considers the progress of health reforms, including Sláintecare and the reform of disability services. The committee also maintains an overview of public health. In addition to the meetings of the full Cabinet and Cabinet committees, I meet Ministers from time to time on an individual basis to focus on different issues. I meet regularly with the Minister for Health to discuss progress and challenges in health, including the Sláintecare reform programme. Sláintecare, which is happening with the support and oversight of the Department of the Taoiseach through the Cabinet committee on health, is about four main issues: making healthcare more affordable; making it more accessible; ensuring better outcomes for patients; and reforming our health service. We are committed to expanding the core capacity of our acute hospitals, with more health professionals and more acute hospital beds.We have added more than 1,000 permanent beds in our acute hospitals since 2020 and 1,000 more consultants. We have increased the total public health sector workforce by more than 26,000 since the start of 2020. That includes an extra 8,000 nurses and midwives, an extra 4,000 social care professionals and almost 3,000 extra doctors and dentists. There is a strong pipeline of capital projects, including several new hospital projects and significant new facilities for existing hospitals. Our multi-annual approach to waiting lists resulted in an overall reduction in the number of patients waiting more than ten to 12 weeks by 27% since the numbers peaked after the pandemic. Waiting lists fell last year for the second year in a row. We are determined to make sure they fall for the third year in a row this year. The figures that matter most are the number of patients waiting the longest, that is, those waiting longer than the ten to 12 weeks recommended by the Sláintecare report. The target of achieving a 10% reduction in patients waiting longer than ten to 12 weeks was met, with an 11% reduction achieved. This covers inpatients, day cases, outpatients and patients undergoing gastrointestinal, GI, scopes, and equates to 57,000 fewer people waiting more than ten to 12 weeks. The enhanced community care programme continues to improve healthcare at a more local level and to alleviate pressure on major hospitals. The majority of community healthcare networks, community intervention teams and community support teams are now in place and providing care closer to home. Work is ongoing on the reconfiguration of the HSE organisational structures into six new health regions and the establishment of elective care centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway, as well as surgical hubs in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford in the interim. At a time when the cost-of-living crisis is affecting everyone, we are making healthcare more affordable through the removal of hospital charges, widened eligibility for the GP card and a reduced drug payment scheme threshold, among other measures. We have allocated more than €22.8 billion for health services in 2024. That will facilitate the continued provision and expansion of quality, affordable healthcare services. Separately, significant funding is also being invested in disability services. Budget 2024 will provide for the further expansion of free contraception provision to include women aged 31; just under €3 million for the development of child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, with the creation of 68 new posts; the first full-year programme of publicly funded assisted human reproduction services, including IVF; more than €20 million for residential placements for children and adults; €15 million for respite services, €18.2 million for day services; and €8.5 million for developments in children's services, including new therapy assistant positions. Our health service has its challenges but it is responding and it has expanded dramatically in recent years. We are treating more people with better outcomes than ever before. Our life expectancy is continuing to increase and is now well above international averages, being in the top five in the European Union. We continue to reduce mortality rates for stroke and certain cancers and to report ever-increasing positive trends in preventative health.	spk_96
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-30	dail	33	Cabinet Committees	dbsect_6	I thank the Deputies for their questions. Deputy Durkan raised the operation and layout of emergency departments. I very much agree with him that staff work very hard in emergency departments and are often subject to abuse and even violence from a minority of patients and their visitors and that is never acceptable. The NTPF is used to commission private healthcare for public patients and it generally works very well. However, patients do have the right to seek healthcare in Northern Ireland or in the EU and have the costs reimbursed. Ultimately, it is their choice. It would be better to use the capacity we have here in our private sector rather than people going abroad but they have that right under EU law. We also have an arrangement with Northern Ireland and people avail of that, particularly for cataracts. Regarding the recruitment freeze and embargo, provision has been made for the HSE to increase its staff this year. It can hire an additional 2,000 staff. Since 2020, we have seen a recruitment surge. We have 8,000 more nurses and midwives than we had in 2020 and there are 3,000 more doctors and dentists. The HSE can hire an additional 2,000 staff but it needs to be done in a proper way. Deputies Moynihan and Murphy asked about drugs policy. I met the chairman of the Citizens' Assembly on Drug Use last week. There were three takeaways for me from what he said. The first is that we need an Irish model; we should not just try to copy models in other countries. The assembly has made a lot of recommendations and it is not just about decriminalisation. He does not want all the focus to be on that. If it is going to be examined by an Oireachtas committee, it should be a special committee, not the health or justice committees because it is relevant to both areas and indeed other areas like education. Our intention is to refer the report to a special Oireachtas committee. The Minister, Deputy Naughton, will bring a memo to Cabinet about that next week. One of the issues the special Oireachtas committee will have to tease is what decriminalisation really means in Ireland in a legal context. Does it mean that is not an offence at all? Does it meant that it is a non-indictable offence? Does it mean that it is an offence without a penalty? Is there something like penalty points or does it actually mean that a certain amount of each particular substance would not be illegal to possess? All of this has to be teased out by the committee. It was not teased out by the assembly. In fairness to the members, they are not legal experts or legislators. With that in mind, we are proposing a timed amendment of nine months to the Private Members' Bill. Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned a particular medication or cream that I am not familiar with. I do not know why it was taken off the GMS and the DPS. There may well be a good reason and there may not be. If the Deputy can pass me a note with the name of the medicine, I will check up on it because I am sure the issue will come up again. Deputy Tóibín asked about access to GP services. We have increased the number of training places dramatically. There are now more doctors qualifying as GPs than there are retiring. It does not take six, seven or eight years. If people train as a GP, in their third year of training they are in practice almost full time, seeing patients. We are seeing those people come through already. We are allowing GPs to come in from other jurisdictions and South Africa in particular. This is because it is an international labour market and people come and go. We are also investing in more practice nurses because in Ireland there is a very low ratio of nurses to GPs. In an Irish general practice, there might be one nurse to four doctors. In a general practice in Holland, there will usually be four nurses and four doctors. That model works very well, so they are the things we are doing. Ozempic is a medicine used both for diabetes and obesity. We should not forget that obesity is a disease. It is good that treatments are now available for it. However, there is a shortfall of supply internationally and for that reason, and rightly so, diabetic patients are being prioritised. The company, Novo Nordisk, is scaling up production, but thinks that it will be the latter part of the year before enough is being produced to meet demand. Finally, to Deputy O'Sullivan's question, I will check up on the heel prick test. I do not know what the current status of the review is. I know we test for many more things than we used to. It used to be just four and now it is approximately 60. I am not exactly sure where we are on that but I will follow up on it. I also want to recognise Deputy's advocacy when it comes to new medicines and rare diseases. As part of the Revised Estimates Volume just before Christmas, we set aside dedicated funding for new medicines for this year. Hopefully, that will see more new medicines and more new uses being approved throughout 2024.	spk_105

#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-24	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	I thank the Deputy. As I said yesterday, the Government does not want to see investment funds buying up family homes that could be bought by individual families for their own use. That is why we changed the law in 2021 in respect of new planning permissions. This particular development got planning permission in 2019 and therefore does not fall under the law we changed in 2021. That is why this particular case has arisen. We have also put a supertax, a stamp duty of 10%, on the bulk purchase of homes. I hear what Sinn Féin is saying, which is that it wants that rate to be increased to 17%. I believe the Social Democrats have proposed 100% while other parties in the Opposition have proposed an outright ban, so even the Opposition is not united on the solution to this issue. We know when it comes to planning permissions granted after 2021 that we have already resolved the issue. What arises is developments that got planning permission before 2021. If we are going to make any changes to stamp duty, we need to examine them carefully to make sure any increase would be effective and that it would not have any unintended consequences. The fact the Opposition is divided three or four ways on this shows it is not a simple matter. While others in the Opposition might vote with Sinn Féin tonight, they do not actually agree with it, which tells a story in itself. I would like to check out the numbers the Deputy has mentioned if she would supply me with them. Quite frankly, it is a higher number than I would have expected, but it may be the case that some of those bulk purchases were for social housing, which is quite different, or that some of them were not family homes. We have made a distinction between apartments and houses and family homes. I would like to interrogate those figures if the Deputy would be good enough to supply them to me. The Deputy said that not one red cent in tax is paid in tax. That is misinformation and is not correct. Tax is paid in the form of stamp duty when the properties are bulk purchased and, when dividends are paid out to shareholders, capital acquisitions tax applies. That was misinformation.	spk_45

If I remember correctly, it was changed in the course of the year, so what would be particularly interesting to see are the numbers for 2022 and 2023 because that is when the change would have had an effect.	spk_49
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-24	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	As I say, I would like to see them and interrogate them. To come back to what the Deputy said in respect of tax, companies and people are taxed differently. If you are an individual, such as a landlord, you pay income tax. Companies do not pay income tax. They never have. Companies pay corporation profit tax and when they issue a dividend to their shareholders, those shareholders pay capital acquisitions tax. That is how they are taxed. To say they do not pay a red cent in tax is misinformation.	spk_51
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-24	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. At the outset, I want to acknowledge that there are far too many people in Ireland waiting far too long to see a specialist or get the operation they need, and that our emergency departments are very busy at the moment and that is putting staff under a lot of pressure. I am really sorry that Mr. Sheehan's grandfather had the experience that he did. It is not acceptable that should be the case. It is important, though, to put on the record of the House that there has been phenomenal additional investment in health services under this Government. Since 2020, only four years ago, we have recruited 20,000 more staff, with 1,000 more consultants. We are now in the top five in terms of practising nurses per head of population in the OECD. That investment is making a difference. We see significant overcrowding in our hospitals this January but it is not as bad as we saw in previous years. That is, at least in part, down to the extra beds, extra doctors, extra nurses and extra staff. We saw last year that waiting times for patients fell. For two years in a row, we have seen waiting lists fall. They peaked after the pandemic, but have been falling since then. I believe this year will be the third year in a row in which we will see the number of people waiting more than ten to 12 weeks fall. That is a not insignificant achievement. North of the Border, across the water in the UK and in most developed countries in the world they are seeing waiting lists rising, yet for Ireland waiting lists have fallen for two years in a row and will fall this year for the third year in a row. That is down to the phenomenal work of the people who work in our health service and also the massive additional Government investment that has been put into the health service in the past three or four years. With regard to the recruitment embargo, it is important to say what that actually means. What it actually means is that the HSE can hire an additional 2,000 staff this year. We have had a big increase in the number of staff in the HSE and it can hire an extra 2,000 staff this year. What we cannot have is what we have seen in the past, that is, the HSE getting approval for one group of staff but not hiring them and hiring a different group of staff instead. We have to put some decent control on this. The recruitment embargo, as it is described, actually means the HSE can hire 2,000 extra people this year, however. Of course, it does not apply to graduate nurses and midwives, for example, or to consultants or GPs.	spk_54
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-24	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	Again, for the information of the House, we hired an extra - and I mean extra - 1,019 medical and dental staff last year. We hired an extra 2,100 nurses and midwives last year and an extra 929 health and social care professionals. Yes, there are lots of people coming and going - we have an international labour market when it comes to healthcare - but we are doing pretty well in terms of recruiting extra staff for the health service. The HSE will be allowed to hire an extra 2,000 staff overall over the course of this year. People describe that as a recruitment freeze. Having laid out the facts, people can decide for themselves whether that is an appropriate term to use. With regard to Limerick, 150 extra beds have been added in the mid-west under this Government, most of them in Limerick. Another 96 are under construction and will come into commission in the new year. Also, a new private hospital is under construction, which will help in terms of the bigger picture, and there is investment in Ennis, Nenagh and St. John's hospitals and community services to take the pressure off the main hospital in Dooradoyle. As we know from Waterford hospital, Connolly Hospital in my constituency, which is a great hospital, St. Vincent's Hospital and hospitals all over the country, it is not just about additional resources, staff and beds; you need good clinical leadership and sharp management too.	spk_56
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-24	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	"I thank the Deputy for his interest and knowledge on this matter. It goes without saying that the greatest drug of use and misuse in this State is alcohol and it is legal. It is associated with public order offences, child abuse and violence against women. It is associated with acute disease and chronic disease. It makes mental health worse. It is associated with suicide, public order offences and major road traffic accidents, yet we would never consider criminalising alcohol in Ireland because we know it would not work. People would not obey the law and alcohol would be driven into the hands of a criminal industry. People would be killed by impure alcohol, as was the case during prohibition periods in Ireland. That is something we all need to be honest about. In my view, drug use and misuse by individuals should be seen primarily as a public health issue and not a criminal justice matter. That is very different from drug dealing, for example, and the production of illegal medicines and drugs. I certainly think that blaming, shaming and criminalising people is not an effective policy and has largely been rejected by the public, particularly younger people. If it was the case that that approach, the war on drugs and ""just say no"" was a successful policy, it would have been successful 40 years ago. It has not worked. We all need to admit that. Certainly that is what the citizens' assembly admitted in its report. In terms of where we go from here, I am going to have a chance to meet with Paul Reid tomorrow. He is going to present the report to me. I am keen to hear his reflections, not just what is written down in the report. He is going to meet with the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, as well, who has responsibility for this area. We will publish the report formally. It is important that we have an opportunity for the Oireachtas to consider it. That is the usual process for a citizens' assembly. We will set out the details as to how that can be done, most likely tomorrow after the meeting with Paul Reid."	spk_58
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-24	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	I used to be a sceptic of citizens' assemblies, but over the past five or ten years I have become a fan of them. They can be really effective. We do not always accept the recommendations, nor do we have to, but we always consider them. When you put in front of 100 citizens all of the evidence, all the experts and all the advice, sometimes they come up with very good recommendations. As I say, we do not always accept them although we often do. We are the Legislature. We are the ones who actually make the decisions in the end and that should never change. We will have to give careful consideration to any kind of legal change. That is our job. That is going to take a bit of work and a bit of advice. I have asked the Garda about this on a number of occasions and they say to me that they rarely prosecute people for possession. Where they do prosecute people for possession, it is because they suspect they have been doing more than possession - that they have been dealing, promoting or selling - but that is the charge they can get them on. There are complexities like that that we need to figure out. Tomorrow we will set out how we best think this report can be taken forward.	spk_60
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-24	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	I have to be honest - I am quite disappointed in the question the Deputy asked. I can see the faces of many people around this House, who I think agree with me. I think the killing and the death of Ashling Murphy was one of those events that really touched the nation. I remember it so well. I remember the outpouring of grief for that young woman who was killed in the way she was. I remember the anniversary only a few weeks ago. I really think that to connect that to a debate about international protection and migration is really wrong.	spk_62
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-24	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	It is really wrong. The evil person who killed poor Ashling Murphy was an EU citizen who had been in the country for the best part of ten years, working and paying taxes. That is how he acquired his rights to social welfare and other things. Sadly, he turned on that girl, for whatever reason he did, and killed her. To connect that to international protection and refugees coming to this country, whether they are genuine or not, is really wrong. Really, Deputy, do not bring our country down into that spiral. Please do not.	spk_64

It has a significant impact on their patient experience and also makes things very difficult for staff. Thankfully, most of those patients will be in beds by this evening. The level of overcrowding we have seen in our hospitals this January, thankfully, is considerably lower than was the case in previous Januarys, in part because of the additional resources provided by the Government, including beds and staff. The budget for the health service has increased substantially for this year. The HSE will be able to hire 2,000 extra staff on top of the number of staff it had last year.	spk_86

#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-24	dail	33	Ceisteanna ar Pholasaí nó ar Reachtaíocht - Questions on Policy or Legislation	dbsect_10	The cost of doing business in Ireland is very high and it is rising. We acknowledge that. Some of that is down to increased labour costs, increased energy costs, the increased cost of supplies and also the withdrawal of some temporary supports for businesses that simply cannot go on forever.There are things the Government can do to help. We will inject over €250 million in the form of grants into small businesses between now and 31 March to help them with cashflow. We are also looking at what we can do around tax warehousing to give businesses a little more time to pay their taxes. They do have to pay their taxes, but this is to give them a little more time to do so. The Deputy makes a very valid point. Where a business may be the only café in a town or small village, is more than just a business competing with other businesses and has a particular social value, we need to look at our social enterprise model there in order to make sure we can help those businesses in a different way. It is a different story if it is three or four pubs competing in a town and one closes. When there an enterprise is the only enterprise in the town and is a gathering point and a community hub, that is quite different.	spk_92

I know this is a major issue around the country, particularly in August, when TDs from all over the country get on to me about it. I will look again into the issue of drivers not being allowed to continue driving up to the age of 72. We allow people to be GPs and do all sorts of other things until they are 72, so I am not sure why that is not the case for drivers if they are medically fit. I do not have a good answer to that question but I will look into it again.	spk_96

I know this is not the first time it has been raised in the House. What has been suggested might be part of the solution to the driver shortage. If I remember correctly, the last time I looked into the matter, I discovered it is not actually a Government rule but a CIÉ rule linked to terms and conditions within that agency, which might then be linked to pensions issues and so on. When it gets into that, it gets very complicated. However, I do promise to take it up again and see if we can make it part of the solution.	spk_98

I know there are cases that were litigated and it was found the existing article did offer very little protection to women in the home. The main purpose, however, of the change we are making is to recognise care in our Constitution. At the moment, care is not recognised. The duty of women in the home is recognised in our Constitution but carers, male and female, within the family do not have recognition and do not have protection. Regardless of the answer to the question in that regard, it is still going to be a positive change because we are extending a gender-specific right that only applies to women in the home to carers who are male or female within the wider family, and that will require the Government to strive to support them.	spk_101

There are better ways to spend €3 million of the education budget than by sending out payslips to teachers and staff.

This is something the Minister, Deputy Foley, will want to engage with the teachers' unions on.	spk_104

As we know from the hospices, we have successfully brought a number of hospices from section 39 to section 38 status. When you do that, it turns out to be much more complicated than people think. While some people may have lesser terms and conditions, others will have better terms and conditions. There are also different pension arrangements. It is never quite as straightforward as it may seem. Removing the autonomy from those bodies and requiring them to apply public service pay scales and pension rules means that there are winners and losers.

Additional consultants are being hired too. I will ask the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, to come back to the Deputy with a more detailed reply setting out the position.	spk_117

That is not means tested. The carer's allowance is means tested. We have relaxed the means test and are changing the pension rules in order that carers who are in receipt of the allowance can receive the full State pension. We are going in the right direction. The referendum, if passed, will protect all of that because there will be constitutional protection for carers for the first time. It will also put an onus on the Government to continue to climb the ladder and make improvements for carers. That is another very good reason why they are calling for a ""Yes"" vote. It is important to put on the record of the House that carer's allowance is a social welfare payment for people who would otherwise not qualify for jobseeker's allowance because they cannot engage in full-time work. If it were to become an employment payment, that would become a very different thing. There would have to be qualifications, regulations and an application process for people to get payment.

That is due to a number of factors, namely, higher labour costs, the energy crisis, the costs of supplies and materials and the withdrawal of temporary Government supports. The latter have to be withdrawn at some point and cannot go on forever. Businesses are closing, but others are also opening. The closure rate, at about 50 per 10,000, is around the long-term average. We have to monitor this very closely, particularly to see whether employment levels may fall in any sector. That would be a very serious alarm bell. Notwithstanding that, we are going to help. Businesses will receive €250 million in grants between now and the end of March. That will help significantly with cashflow. We are going to make some changes to tax warehousing in order to give businesses more time to pay their taxes, but they do have to pay those taxes. Energy prices are coming down.

The next meeting of the committee is scheduled for 15 February 2024. Membership of the committee comprises: the Taoiseach; the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and for Defence; the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, who is also Minister for Transport; and the Ministers for Finance, Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. Other Ministers or Ministers of State are invited to participate as required. The committee oversees the implementation of the programme for Government commitments aimed at sustainable economic recovery, investment and job creation, including Harnessing Digital, our national digital strategy. We continue to see good domestic economic performance, more people are at work than ever before, and female participation is at an all-time high. Our economic model continues to be founded on a well-established and successful pro-enterprise policy framework, providing a stable and sustainable regulatory and tax environment, with sound management of the public finances and significant investment in the infrastructure and skills required to ensure our competitiveness.

#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-24	dail	33	Departmental Bodies	dbsect_11	I thank the Deputies for their questions. I join Deputy Dillon in complimenting the IDA on its success in securing investment and good jobs for Ireland. Again, over half the investment is occurring outside Dublin. I would like to see that figure rise further in the coming years and I have said that to the IDA board. I will follow up about the Castlebar advance building solution with the CEO of the IDA. I understand there has been a difficulty securing an appropriate site. That was the last update, but I will seek another one. I am very keen to see another investment in Castlebar similar to that of Meissner, which was a good boost for the town economically. Deputy McDonald spoke about corporate insolvencies having gone up, and that is correct. It is important to point out, though, that the number of corporate insolvencies was extremely low for the past couple of years, due in large part to the Government’s unprecedented financial supports for business, which cannot go on forever. We are still seeing that insolvencies are below the long-term average of about 50 per 10,000 per year. As for what we can do to help businesses with their costs, which we are doing, the new increased cost of business scheme will provide relief to small businesses affected by rising costs. Under the scheme, in excess of €250 million is being set aside to assist businesses and we will ensure it is all paid out. Approximately 150,000 small businesses, which is 95% of all rateable businesses, are expected to benefit, with each eligible business receiving up to €5,000 from the State in early 2024. The funds will provide immediate financial aid to small businesses in the face of current economic challenges. A new national enterprise hub will be fully operational early this year and it will have a dedicated team of expert advisers specifically trained to help guide business owners through the range of grants, loans and vouchers that are now available and, where necessary, put the business owner in direct contact with the relevant agency. We have also allocated an extra €9 million to the LEOs to assist small businesses. That boost in funding will allow them to provide essential assistance and resources to local business. We have also increased the research and development tax credit from 25% to 30% as well as increasing the upfront payment from €25,000 to €50,000, which will especially benefit small businesses. We have increased the VAT registration threshold for microbusinesses to €40,000 for services and €80,000 for goods. That reflects the Government’s commitment to bolstering small business and acknowledging its role local communities. The debt warehousing scheme is set to expire on 1 May. There has been a significant reduction in warehoused tax debt being paid from a peak of €3.2 billion to €1.76 billion, and the number of businesses that owe tax has fallen from 110,000 to just 57,000. However, we recognise cash flow is very tight for some businesses, especially at this time of year, and we want them to continue to trade so they can pay those back taxes. The Minister, Deputy McGrath, is actively engaged with the Revenue Commissioners on the scheme. Building on undertakings already in place, a proposal is being developed and it should be finalised in the next two weeks. There are several benefits already in place for businesses engaging early on the repayment of warehoused debt. On the audiovisual stakeholders' forum, I had not heard that it had been established, but if that is the case, I am glad to hear that is happening. It is something I have encouraged the Minister, Deputy Martin, to do. I recognise the very high number of Irish people, businesses, producers and artists who have been nominated for Oscars, particularly Element Pictures. Theirs is an extraordinary achievement and I congratulate them on the work they do and on their creativity. Back in 2017, we announced we would double Government funding for the arts and culture by 2024. We have honoured that commitment and I hope the additional Government support has, in some way, contributed to the success of Irish literature, art and film in the past couple of years. In response to Deputy Barry's question, I am reluctant to comment on any individual contract or any individual enterprise. We in this House set down the minimum conditions when it comes to all forms of leave and businesses have to apply them. It is up to businesses to decide to offer better terms and conditions if they so choose or if they are negotiating with a trade union, but what we stand over are the minimum terms and conditions we set in these Houses. On housing, we will be publishing our progress report on Housing For All on Thursday, including the house building statistics from the CSO. I do not know what they are yet but it is my expectation that, last year, we will have built more than 30,000 new homes in Ireland, the highest in 15 years, which is no small example of progress. Homelessness and people living in State accommodation is a much more complex issue driven by lots of different factors that are not necessarily under our control. Where it happens, we try to make sure homelessness is rare, short lived and not repeated. A very large number of the people who have to experience homelessness, almost half, do so for less than six months and the majority, thankfully, for less than a year, but I totally appreciate that is a very long time in the life of a child, in particular.	spk_138
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-24	dail	33	Departmental Bodies	dbsect_11	I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 8, inclusive, together. I participated in the western Balkans summit which took place on 13 December in Brussels. The meeting brought together EU leaders with their counterparts from six countries in the western Balkans, namely, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Albania, Montenegro, and Serbia. On conclusion of the summit, the EU and the leaders of the six western Balkan countries signed the Brussels Declaration. This reaffirms the EU membership perspective of the countries of the western Balkans and the commitment of the countries involved to continue to undertake the political and economic reforms required for EU accession, including in the area of the rule of law. The declaration also underlines the importance of economic development in the region, especially for building security, and welcomed the new growth plan for the western Balkans under which the European Union will provide substantial funding to the countries of the western Balkans. On 14 and 15 December, I attended a meeting of the European Council. Leaders discussed their continued solidarity with Ukraine, the situation in the Middle East, enlargement, the mid-term review of the EU’s multi-annual budget for 2021 to 2027, security and defence, migration, hybrid attacks, the fight against antisemitism, racism and xenophobia, and the EU strategic agenda for 2024 to 2029. EU leaders restated their condemnation of Russia’s war on Ukraine and reaffirmed their unwavering solidarity with Ukraine and its people. Overall assistance made available to Ukraine from the EU since the start of the war has reached approximately €85 billion. Leaders stressed the importance of consistent and predictable solidarity with Ukraine through the European Peace Facility, the EU military assistance mission and direct bilateral assistance from member states. We welcomed the agreement on the 12th package of sanctions and stressed the need to ensure compliance to avoid circumvention. Most significantly, in line with the recommendation of the Commission, we agreed to open EU accession negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova and to grant candidate status to Georgia. I have long said that Ukraine’s future belongs within the EU family, and this is another important step in making that a reality. Given the need to ensure sustainable financial assistance to Ukraine, it was disappointing we were unable to reach a consensus on the mid-term review of the multi-annual financial framework, which includes a new facility for Ukraine of up to €50 billion in grants and loans over four years. The package of an additional €64.6 billion in total, which includes additional funding for areas like migration, had the endorsement of 26 member states but was blocked by Hungary. The European Council will therefore return to the matter at a further meeting in Brussels next week on 1 February, and I hope it will be possible to reach agreement. We also had a strategic debate on the Middle East, but given our very different perspectives, it was not possible to agree conclusions on the very serious situation in Gaza. In our discussion, I was joined by a majority of leaders in calling for an immediate ceasefire to allow much-needed humanitarian access and to enable the release of the remaining hostages. Leaders resumed our discussion on the European Council’s strategic agenda for the period 2024 to 2029, which will provide guidance for the next institutional cycle, including in the area of enlargement and reforms. It is set to be adopted by the summer of 2024.	spk_139
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-24	dail	33	Departmental Bodies	dbsect_11	I thank the Deputies for their questions. Prime Minister Orbán of Hungary did not use his veto to block talks with Ukraine on membership. In fairness to him, he made his case and made it very strongly. He could have vetoed it but chose not to. It is unfair to mischaracterise him because by not using the veto he allowed European countries to proceed with the majority decision. He was not willing to do that as regards the budget. I hope we can come to a solution on 1 February. If we have to, there is a workaround. The other 26 member states could provide the financial package to Ukraine anyway on a multilateral or bilateral basis. What we would then lose out on, however, is the other aspect of the package, although it is a smaller one, which is about innovation, migration, helping to secure the external borders of the European Union, and investments in the western Balkans. It would be a shame to lose the package and only be able to proceed with the Ukraine element. For that reason, I hope we can come to a solution. No conclusions were agreed on Gaza for a very simple reason. The majority of EU member states, including Ireland, wanted a specific call for a ceasefire. That was blocked by a minority of states, which take the view that the call for a ceasefire would not be adhered to by Hamas and would restrict Israel in anti-terrorist activities. We do not agree with that assessment but that is the reason they gave. On Palestine, I reaffirm the Government's firm support for Palestinian statehood. It is not a gift to be given by Israel. The people of Palestine have a right to secure a homeland. We need to redouble our efforts at all levels to make sure that happens. We also respect Israel's right to defend itself, not just against other countries that attack it but terrorist organisations supported by other countries that attack it. However, the response in Gaza has been disproportionate and is in breach of international humanitarian law. On the Genocide Convention, I restate that the Government supports the work of the ICJ and the ICC. We recognise their judgments and we provide those courts with funding. They have a very important role to play when it comes to accountability and deterrents. However, we have to be clear and honest with people on this. The ICJ did not stop the war in Ukraine and will not be able to stop the war in Gaza. I am not aware of any war that has ever been stopped by a court order. Wars end in one of three ways: military victory by one side over the other; an armistice or frozen conflict such as that in Korea; or a political and diplomatic settlement. We are putting our efforts into a political and diplomatic settlement, including a humanitarian ceasefire to allow aid to get in, the killing to stop and hostages to be released, followed by a permanent ceasefire, which would involve Hamas fighters and leaders leaving Gaza-----	spk_145
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-24	dail	33	Departmental Bodies	dbsect_11	-----allowing the Palestinian Authority to take over Gaza with international support. That would then lead to talks not just on a two-state solution but on wider mutual security for the region. If we are serious about stopping this conflict and ending this 75-year cycle of violence and terrorism, that has to be our priority. However, we will of course take our role under the various international conventions seriously. The Attorney General will be in the Hague in person on 22 February to give Ireland's intervention regarding an ICJ case on the occupation of Palestine. We will consider South Africa's case when it is lodged, which it has not yet been. That is exactly the approach we took in respect of the Russia-Ukraine case. I have taken an interest in the EU directive on violence against women. I spoke about it to Frances Fitzgerald, who is the rapporteur, and the Minister, Deputy McEntee. Ireland believes the definition of rape should be based on consent and not on force. Other countries have different views on that. We want to make sure anything agreed does not water down our own laws in any way because it is about consent and not force. There is now a risk that there will not be an EU directive at all because it has to get through in the next couple of weeks. The most important thing is that we get the directive through. I am a great believer in incremental progress. We might not get everything we want in it, but if we can get our first EU directive on this issue passed and through, we can then build on it into the future. On the US Administration, I shared my views with the US ambassador and other members of the Administration on the situation in the Middle East. We have had the chance to meet casually at international meetings in the past couple of weeks. I look forward to having the opportunity to discuss the issue with President Biden in March should I be invited to attend the White House, which I have not been yet.	spk_147
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-24	dail	33	Departmental Bodies	dbsect_11	I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 to 11, inclusive, together. Through the shared island initiative, the Government is engaging with all communities to build a consensus around a shared future, underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement. The Government has so far allocated almost €250 million from the shared island fund. This includes contributing to the expansion of higher education infrastructure in the north west, with funding for a new teaching building at Ulster University in Derry, and progressing the Ulster Canal restoration in the central Border region. The Government has also introduced new programmes that bring people together throughout the island, including through the community climate action scheme, the Creative Ireland programme and the shared island civic society fund.I will open the third annual shared island forum on 8 February in Dublin Castle and will set out then the Government’s priorities for the initiative in the year ahead. I met with members of the shared island youth forum in Dublin on 7 December. Since September, the forum has been bringing together 80 young people aged 18 to 25, who are meeting regularly over the course of a year to develop and to set out their vision and values for a shared future on the island. The forum members were all born after the Good Friday Agreement was signed in 1998. They are dedicated to using the forum as an opportunity to give voice to their generation, and to help to influence how we share the island of Ireland into the future. I look forward to the forum’s outcome statement later this year. The shared island dialogue series is continuing with more than 3,300 citizens and civic representatives having participated in the past three years. The Tánaiste spoke at the most recent event in October on the theme of accommodating national identities. The shared island research programme is also continuing, with 30 publications so far examining the island in economic, cultural, social and political terms. The next ESRI shared island report examines housing supply factors and will be launched on 31 January. Finally, I want to recognise the serious challenges for the people of Northern Ireland and for the Good Friday Agreement with the continuing absence of the power-sharing institutions for almost two years now. The Government will continue to work to see the return of the power-sharing institutions. Under all scenarios we will also continue to develop opportunities to take forward all-island investment and co-operation and to deepen both North-South and east-west relationships, in accordance with the objectives and commitments of the Good Friday Agreement.	spk_148
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-24	dail	33	Departmental Bodies	dbsect_11	I thank Deputy Farrell for raising the shared island youth forum. It has been really good success. I had a chance to meet with them in Dublin a few months ago. It brings together 80 young people between the ages of 18 and 25 who are meeting over the course of a year to set out their vision and values for a shared future. There are 40 young people from the North and 40 from the South, and there is balance in terms of gender, ethnicity, community, faith and other identity diversities. The forum focuses on five themes of sustainability, opportunity, well-being, equality and cultural identity. There have been five meetings so far, both North and South, and the next meeting will be on Friday in the Aviva Stadium in Dublin. The forum is organised by the shared island unit in partnership with the National Youth Council of Ireland and Youth Action Northern Ireland. When I had a chance to meet with the forum members, they certainly shared with me their various views on the particular political impasse occurring in the North but we have not made it a focus of the forum really because we want them to think long term rather than about the current political difficulties. Deputy Smith spoke about the geopark, which I had a chance to visit as Minister for tourism a long time ago. It is really great to see that develop. It will be a fabulous asset and amenity. Indeed, it already is. I agree with Deputy Smith's comments on PEACEPLUS and its predecessor programmes and the billions of euro that have been invested in Northern Ireland and the Border counties. The Deputy encouraged us to reach out to the hard-to-reach groups, areas and communities. I totally agree with that. It can be difficult to do this with any government funding scheme, be it sports capital or a community scheme, not just in Northern Ireland and the Border areas. Better organised, better equipped and better skilled volunteer groups find it easier to apply for money and then find it easier to draw it down. That does not make it okay. It actually puts an additional obligation on us, as the people in office, and on our civil servants and assistants to reach out to those communities that may not have the skills or stability, or who struggle with the governance issues, to make sure that money goes to where it is needed most. This, of course, is easier said than done. On the issue of eBay and the potential redundancies there, I have not had any personal contact with the company. That relationship would be managed by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and by IDA Ireland. If they have not been in contact, I am sure they will. Obviously we need to make sure that any redundancies are minimised, that they are voluntary rather than compulsory if possible, and that a package is put in place for any staff who lose their jobs. With regard to the situation in Northern Ireland, we have ongoing engagement with the five major political parties in the North. Certainly when it comes to the issue of the Executive and the Assembly being re-established, the DUP would strongly believe it is very much a strand 1 issue in which the Irish Government has no role. We respect that view even if we do not agree with it. It is the establishment of the Executive and the Assembly that will allow the North-South ministerial bodies to function. Strand 2 is dependent on strand 1 operating.We are very keen to be of assistance in any way we can. If the assembly and the Executive are re-established we want to make sure they are successful and sustainable. This is why we are willing to help in any way that we can.	spk_152
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-24	dail	33	Cabinet Committees	dbsect_12	I propose to take question Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together. The Cabinet committee on the economy and investment was re-established in January 2023. It met twice last year, most recently on 16 November. The next meeting of the committee is scheduled for 15 February 2024. Membership of the committee comprises: the Taoiseach; the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and for Defence; the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, who is also Minister for Transport; and the Ministers for Finance, Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. Other Ministers or Ministers of State are invited to participate as required. The committee oversees the implementation of the programme for Government commitments aimed at sustainable economic recovery, investment and job creation, including Harnessing Digital, our national digital strategy. We continue to see good domestic economic performance, more people are at work than ever before, and female participation is at an all-time high. Our economic model continues to be founded on a well-established and successful pro-enterprise policy framework, providing a stable and sustainable regulatory and tax environment, with sound management of the public finances and significant investment in the infrastructure and skills required to ensure our competitiveness. As with all policy areas, economic issues are regularly discussed at full meetings of the Government, where all formal decisions are made.	spk_130
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-24	dail	33	Cabinet Committees	dbsect_12	I thank the Deputies for their questions. I join Deputy Dillon in complimenting the IDA on its success in securing investment and good jobs for Ireland. Again, over half the investment is occurring outside Dublin. I would like to see that figure rise further in the coming years and I have said that to the IDA board. I will follow up about the Castlebar advance building solution with the CEO of the IDA. I understand there has been a difficulty securing an appropriate site. That was the last update, but I will seek another one. I am very keen to see another investment in Castlebar similar to that of Meissner, which was a good boost for the town economically. Deputy McDonald spoke about corporate insolvencies having gone up, and that is correct. It is important to point out, though, that the number of corporate insolvencies was extremely low for the past couple of years, due in large part to the Government’s unprecedented financial supports for business, which cannot go on forever. We are still seeing that insolvencies are below the long-term average of about 50 per 10,000 per year. As for what we can do to help businesses with their costs, which we are doing, the new increased cost of business scheme will provide relief to small businesses affected by rising costs. Under the scheme, in excess of €250 million is being set aside to assist businesses and we will ensure it is all paid out. Approximately 150,000 small businesses, which is 95% of all rateable businesses, are expected to benefit, with each eligible business receiving up to €5,000 from the State in early 2024. The funds will provide immediate financial aid to small businesses in the face of current economic challenges. A new national enterprise hub will be fully operational early this year and it will have a dedicated team of expert advisers specifically trained to help guide business owners through the range of grants, loans and vouchers that are now available and, where necessary, put the business owner in direct contact with the relevant agency. We have also allocated an extra €9 million to the LEOs to assist small businesses. That boost in funding will allow them to provide essential assistance and resources to local business. We have also increased the research and development tax credit from 25% to 30% as well as increasing the upfront payment from €25,000 to €50,000, which will especially benefit small businesses. We have increased the VAT registration threshold for microbusinesses to €40,000 for services and €80,000 for goods. That reflects the Government’s commitment to bolstering small business and acknowledging its role local communities. The debt warehousing scheme is set to expire on 1 May. There has been a significant reduction in warehoused tax debt being paid from a peak of €3.2 billion to €1.76 billion, and the number of businesses that owe tax has fallen from 110,000 to just 57,000. However, we recognise cash flow is very tight for some businesses, especially at this time of year, and we want them to continue to trade so they can pay those back taxes. The Minister, Deputy McGrath, is actively engaged with the Revenue Commissioners on the scheme. Building on undertakings already in place, a proposal is being developed and it should be finalised in the next two weeks. There are several benefits already in place for businesses engaging early on the repayment of warehoused debt. On the audiovisual stakeholders' forum, I had not heard that it had been established, but if that is the case, I am glad to hear that is happening. It is something I have encouraged the Minister, Deputy Martin, to do. I recognise the very high number of Irish people, businesses, producers and artists who have been nominated for Oscars, particularly Element Pictures. Theirs is an extraordinary achievement and I congratulate them on the work they do and on their creativity. Back in 2017, we announced we would double Government funding for the arts and culture by 2024. We have honoured that commitment and I hope the additional Government support has, in some way, contributed to the success of Irish literature, art and film in the past couple of years. In response to Deputy Barry's question, I am reluctant to comment on any individual contract or any individual enterprise. We in this House set down the minimum conditions when it comes to all forms of leave and businesses have to apply them. It is up to businesses to decide to offer better terms and conditions if they so choose or if they are negotiating with a trade union, but what we stand over are the minimum terms and conditions we set in these Houses. On housing, we will be publishing our progress report on Housing For All on Thursday, including the house building statistics from the CSO. I do not know what they are yet but it is my expectation that, last year, we will have built more than 30,000 new homes in Ireland, the highest in 15 years, which is no small example of progress. Homelessness and people living in State accommodation is a much more complex issue driven by lots of different factors that are not necessarily under our control. Where it happens, we try to make sure homelessness is rare, short lived and not repeated. A very large number of the people who have to experience homelessness, almost half, do so for less than six months and the majority, thankfully, for less than a year, but I totally appreciate that is a very long time in the life of a child, in particular.	spk_138
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-24	dail	33	European Council	dbsect_13	I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 8, inclusive, together.

The declaration also underlines the importance of economic development in the region, especially for building security, and welcomed the new growth plan for the western Balkans under which the European Union will provide substantial funding to the countries of the western Balkans. On 14 and 15 December, I attended a meeting of the European Council. Leaders discussed their continued solidarity with Ukraine, the situation in the Middle East, enlargement, the mid-term review of the EU’s multi-annual budget for 2021 to 2027, security and defence, migration, hybrid attacks, the fight against antisemitism, racism and xenophobia, and the EU strategic agenda for 2024 to 2029.

Obviously we need to make sure that any redundancies are minimised, that they are voluntary rather than compulsory if possible, and that a package is put in place for any staff who lose their jobs. With regard to the situation in Northern Ireland, we have ongoing engagement with the five major political parties in the North. Certainly when it comes to the issue of the Executive and the Assembly being re-established, the DUP would strongly believe it is very much a strand 1 issue in which the Irish Government has no role. We respect that view even if we do not agree with it. It is the establishment of the Executive and the Assembly that will allow the North-South ministerial bodies to function. Strand 2 is dependent on strand 1 operating.We are very keen to be of assistance in any way we can. If the assembly and the Executive are re-established we want to make sure they are successful and sustainable. This is why we are willing to help in any way that we can.	spk_152
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-24	dail	33	Post-European Council Meeting: Statements	dbsect_16	I attended a meeting of the European Council on 14 and 15 December in Brussels. The agenda covered the Middle East, Ukraine, EU enlargement, the multi-annual financial framework, security and defence, migration, COP28, EU-Türkiye relations, the fight against antisemitism, racism and xenophobia, and the EU strategic agenda. In his contribution to today's debate, the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, will provide further detail on enlargement, security and defence and migration. I will deal with all other issues. At our meeting, leaders discussed the devastating situation in Gaza. With others, I argued for an immediate ceasefire to prevent the loss of further innocent civilian lives, to allow access for urgently needed humanitarian assistance and to facilitate the release of hostages held by Hamas and other terrorist groups for far too long. This position was supported by a strong majority of member states on this occasion. However, a number of countries disagreed with the call for an immediate ceasefire, and as a result it was not possible to reach consensus on substantive conclusions. It was their view that a ceasefire would prevent Israel from anti-terror actions against Hamas. We do not agree with this assessment. The Government will continue to press our position within the EU, at the UN, and in our international engagements. This conflict must stop. The killing must end. We have already seen horrific loss of human life, including the deaths of thousands of children. UN agencies and NGOs on the ground are warning of an imminent risk of extreme hunger and even famine. We have seen the wholesale destruction of homes and of vital civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, universities and the displacement of most of Gaza’s population. Civil society is on the brink of collapse, as people compete for desperately scarce resources as the weather gets colder. Tá cúrsaí dofhulaingthe agus is scannal don domhan é. Leanfaidh Éire ag obair ar son sos cogaidh láithreach. This situation is intolerable and a scandal to the world. Ireland will continue to work for an immediate ceasefire and a permanent peace. We will also work to ensure accountability for breaches of international humanitarian law on both sides. The House is aware that South Africa is bringing an action against Israel under the genocide convention at the International Court of Justice. These proceedings deserve to be treated with the utmost seriousness. Genocide is the gravest of crimes, as it involves the intentional destruction of an entire people, in whole or in part. The court is expected to make its decision on provisional measures sought by South Africa in the near future. In doing so it will indicate whether it considers that there is any basis under the genocide convention to limit or suspend Israel’s military operations. Its decisions are final and binding. We will support and respect any ruling. As this is a complex case, a ruling on the substantial issue, on whether or not Israel has breached the convention, could take many years. To date the hearings have involved only the two parties to the case, namely, Israel and South Africa. Other states that are party to the convention, including Ireland, can subsequently choose to intervene. This is something that the Government will consider very seriously indeed. If we decide that an intervention is warranted, we will submit one, as we have done previously, including in the case Ukraine is taking against Russia. Ultimately, however, any decision the court might make would not be binding on Hamas as it is not a party to the convention. We will, therefore, continue to pursue all possible diplomatic, political and humanitarian channels to alleviate the situation for the people of Gaza. Only a ceasefire on all sides can create the space for a political solution. The worsening situation in the West Bank is also a serious concern. At the meeting of the European Council, I argued for sanctions against violent settlers who are attacking and displacing Palestinian communities. We want to see this agreed rapidly, and I really hope that we can see progress on this in the coming weeks. The Tánaiste in particular is working very hard on this. As the House knows, there can be no lasting and just peace and security for the people of Israel and Palestine without a sustainable political agreement, based on a two-state solution with the two states both viable and secure. The Government will continue to do anything that we can to bring this about. The European Council also discussed Russia's full-scale war on Ukraine which has now been going on for almost two years. At our meeting we made the historic decision to open accession negotiations with Ukraine, recognising the remarkable progress Ukraine has made in undertaking essential reforms in the most difficult of circumstances. Our decision was an important signal of our ongoing commitment to Ukraine, and our firm belief that its peoples' future belongs within our Union. Ireland will continue to do all we can to help it progress along its European path. Ireland also fully supports the Commission's proposal for a Ukraine Facility, to put our financial support for Ukraine on a stable and reliable footing for the next four years. I was disappointed that an agreement could not be reached at the December European Council. I am hopeful that it will be possible to reach agreement at the special meeting of the European Council on 1 February. Ukraine urgently needs this funding in order to maintain financial stability and continue to provide essential services. The European Council also discussed long-term military support for Ukraine and reiterated its commitment to providing assistance through the European Peace Facility, the EU Military Assistance Mission for Ukraine and bilateral assistance by member states, and to contribute to future security commitments over the longer term. The European Council returned in December to the proposed revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027. The proposed revision covers sustainable multi-annual funding for Ukraine, migration and external action, investments in strategically important technologies, and technical adjustments to cover higher interest costs on next generation EU borrowings. The negotiating box presented by President Michel to guide our discussions provided for an additional financial envelope of €64.6 billion, including €50 billion for the Ukraine Facility, comprising €17 billion in grants and €33 billion in loans; €9.6 billion for migration; and €1.5 billion for STEP, which is the strategic technologies for Europe platform. President Michel’s proposal reduced the amount of new moneys needed to €21 billion by reprioritising and reallocating €10.6 billion already in the budget. This was a significant reduction from the almost €66 billion extra originally proposed by the Commission. President Michel’s proposal was acceptable to 26 countries, including Ireland. However, Hungary was not prepared to agree. In the period since our meeting discussions have continued and, as I have said, I hope it will be possible for us to sign off on the package when we meet on 1 February. At our meeting in December, President Michel also updated us on the work to prepare the European Council’s strategic agenda for the period from 2024 to 2029. This will guide the work of the European Council over the coming five years. President Michel wrote to leaders in June 2023, setting out proposed priorities. These are EU external relations, security and defence, energy, our economic and social base, migration, and the protection and promotion of EU values. Work was launched at the informal meeting of members of the European Council in Granada in October and continued via a series of smaller meetings in Berlin, Copenhagen, Zagreb and Paris in November. I attended the small meeting in Copenhagen. Having heard from leaders in December, President Michel will now begin to formulate proposals, to be considered at a further round of consultations, before the work is concluded by the European Council in June.Ireland will continue to reflect on our priorities as a fully engaged and enthusiastic member of the European Union and we will feed into the development of the strategic agenda in the months ahead. I will continue to keep the House informed of progress on this and other strands of the European Council’s work in the period ahead.	spk_154
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-23	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I do not like to see investment funds buying up family homes  On stamp duty, stamp duty is set at 10%. We are not ruling out an increase, as the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, has made clear, but it is something that has to be considered carefully because any change to tax can have unforeseen impacts and such changes sometimes do not work. We therefore need to make sure that if there is any change, it is thought through and teased out correctly. However, to be very clear, we have changed the law in this area. This could not happen in respect of any development granted planning permission from 2021 onwards. This is an old outstanding planning permission and that is why it was possible in this case. With regard to the sale of family homes to bulk buyers, I do not have the exact figures in front of me but I think it was something like 600 or 680 out of 50,000 transactions last year, equating to perhaps 1,000 out of 100,000 transactions. It is not minimal or inconsiderable but it would not be accurate to create the impression that this is happening in great numbers.	spk_3
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-23	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I have not seen the detail of the advice to the Minister, Deputy McGrath. I expect that when I see it, I will find out that Deputy McDonald has not told the full story or given the full picture to the Irish people and that she has engaged in a degree of misrepresentation and misleading behaviour. I suspect that the advice will also say that the number of family homes bought up by investment funds might have been something like 1% or 2% of total sales-----	spk_5
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-23	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	-----but I will double-check that. As I said earlier, the Government does not want to see family homes being bought up by investment funds. That is not the case at all. It is something we think is undesirable socially and economically. That is why we changed the law in 2021 to stop this happening. It does not apply to old permissions. This is an old permission from 2019. The Deputy's contention is that increasing stamp duty to 17% will solve the problem but she does not know that. A rate of 17% might not be enough or it might have other unintended consequences that she has not thought about and that would do harm to people and businesses. That is why it is important to give very careful consideration to any tax changes.	spk_7
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-23	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	Like everyone in the House, I am appalled at the ongoing violence that is occurring in Gaza and, indeed, in the West Bank and Israel, where millions of people have been displaced and tens of thousands killed, mostly women and children. We should not forget there are two sides to this conflict. It is the case that many more Palestinians have died than Israelis and many more Palestinians have been displaced than Israelis but there have been Israelis killed and Palestinians and Israelis displaced too. It is important that should be acknowledged, perhaps in the Deputy's next remarks. In terms of what we are doing as a Government, we are working at EU level, UN level and bilateral level to do anything we practically can do to bring about a ceasefire. We were among the first countries in the world to call for a humanitarian ceasefire. That is the way we voted at UN and EU levels and we will continue to look for that because we need a ceasefire so that humanitarian aid can get in, the killing can stop and the hostages who are still being held in Gaza can be released. What happens at the ICJ and the International Criminal Court is really important. We are very big supporters of these institutions but I am sad to say I do not believe an order from the ICJ will bring about an end to this conflict. It did not do so in Ukraine. It may be four years before the case is finally decided. This conflict will be brought to an end by diplomacy and politics.That is why we are focusing on diplomacy and politics. What the Government is asking the House to agree to tonight is to recognise that our overwhelming priority is exactly that, namely, trying to achieve a ceasefire on both sides and an end to the violence by way of diplomacy and politics. We are also demanding unhindered humanitarian access to Gaza, and we are supporting the UN in its work in that regard. We are also committing to support any decision of the ICJ on preliminary measures. These will be final and binding on the parties concerned, and we will urge all parties to the genocide convention to do so. We are also committing to considering an intervention in the case of South Africa  On ICJ cases, the Attorney General will travel to The Hague on 22 February to make Ireland's intervention in respect of the situation in Israel and Palestine in person. That relates to an existing case before the ICJ regarding Israel's actions in Palestine and the West Bank. I hope that proves we are taking this seriously and that we are taking the ICJ seriously. We want to do this properly, just as we have with that case and just as we did in relation to Ukraine.	spk_9
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-23	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	As I mentioned earlier, the Attorney General will travel to the ICJ in The Hague on 22 February and will make Ireland's intervention in respect of the case relating to Israel and Palestine and the actions happening in that regard in person. This demonstrates that we take these matters seriously and that we take the ICJ seriously. On the genocide convention case, we will adopt the same approach that we did in respect of Russia and Ukraine. We will wait until South Africa files its memorial - its main case. We will consider it and at that point we will decide on the nature of any intervention. We do agree that South Africa's case is valid. The motion put down by the Deputy's party is good in parts, but I think it is flawed. I would like the party to consider amending it. The motion does not condemn Hamas. It does not call for the release of the hostages, and I think that is wrong. It does not call for Hamas to cease fire or to disarm. Hamas is a terrorist organisation, and terrorist organisations should disarm. The only real mention of Hamas and the events of 7 October is to say that they do not justify Israel's actions. I do not think that is good enough.	spk_11
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-23	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	There has been considerable investment in University Hospital Waterford under this Government. Just since 2019, there has been a 40% increase in staffing at the hospital. The hospital's budget is now approximately €270 million. There has been a 33% increase in the budget since 2019. There has been considerable investment in Waterford. That includes the second cath lab, which people in the region campaigned very hard for over a long period. That is open now, and we want to extend the hours to weekends as soon as possible. There is a new outpatient unit. There is also the Dunmore wing, which I have had the pleasure to visit, and the new palliative care unit. I assure the Deputy that I do not think that investment in University Hospital Waterford has been adequate either. That is why there needs to be more. Among the future investments coming is the new surgical hub, which will help people to get operations they need much more quickly, and the replacement of the adult mental health unit with a 50 single-bed unit, which I think will be a considerable improvement too. Of course, we need to examine future capacity at the hospital. It is a hospital that performs very well and that experiences very little emergency department overcrowding. It really helped out when the fire happened in Wexford hospital. Hospitals that perform well should be rewarded. That is why I want to see more investment happening in Waterford University Hospital in the coming years. The Deputy can be sure that is going to happen.	spk_14
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-23	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	In terms of clarifying the record, I think I have done that already by correspondence. Like a lot of things, investment depends on how you count it, that is, whether you count the spend when it is actually spent, which often happens after the building has been built, or when it is announced or when it is under construction. What the Deputy and I do not disagree on is that Waterford and the south east need more investment, and I can guarantee him that so long as this Government remains in office, and so long as there is no fundamental change in our economic and foreign policy, that will continue to be possible. That is why it is important this Government should remain in office. There has been considerable IDA investment in Waterford and the south east. As the Deputy pointed out, we established the long-promised university for the south east and that includes the purchase of the Waterford Crystal site in Waterford, which is very welcome. We will get the engineering building done, but the Deputy will be aware there are complications in the negotiations there. Work has begun on the north quays development, which will transform the city of Waterford, opening up a whole new quarter. It even involves the moving of the train station, so it is a huge investment. There has also been considerable road investment in the south east, such as the New Ross bypass and in Enniscorthy. In respect of Waterford Airport, we are keen to invest in that. The Minister, Deputy McGrath, visited it not too long ago. We made a commitment on funding. It turns out it is not enough. A further business case has been submitted for more funding and we are examining it with due haste.	spk_16
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-23	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. I know many Deputies have done so, in Government parties and Opposition parties alike. We are a Government that supports enterprise and wants to make work pay. We believe it is possible to reward enterprise and reward work. However, there are interplays and balances that have to be struck, and we have to strike them right. I acknowledge that the cost of doing business is very high and is rising. Some of that is down to pay. Much of it is down to energy. Some of it is down to the cost of supplies and materials. Some of it is Government-influenced, but the Government has no influence over much of it. We are helping businesses. More than a quarter of a billion euro will be injected into small businesses in the form of grants by the end of March. That is designed to help businesses with cash flow, particularly at this very difficult time. We are now seeing energy prices falling, which is very encouraging. I hope we will see interest rates falling throughout the course of this year as well. The increase in the minimum wage was recommended by the Low Pay Commission, and our plan is to bring the minimum wage up to the level of the living wage, which is approximately 60% of median earnings. We want to do that as soon as we possibly can. We acknowledge, however, that we have to monitor how this works out on the ground, because we have seen very big increases in the minimum wage in recent years. While it is not double, it is much higher than it was ten or 11 years ago. Despite a very big increase in the minimum wage, we have not seen unemployment rising. In fact, the reverse has happened. There are more people at work than ever before. While businesses are opening and closing all the time, the number of closures at the moment is below the long-term average of 50 per 10,000. However, this is something we will have to monitor very closely, because there is no point in putting up somebody’s wages if they then lose their job or have their hours cut. This is something we will have to monitor over the next couple of months and take account of when the Low Pay Commission makes its recommendation for next year, because there are other employment-related costs that are going to rise, such as pension contributions under auto-enrolment and the 0.1% increase in PRSI. I take very seriously what businesses are saying. We acknowledge that the cost of doing business is high. We are helping, particularly with the quarter of a billion euro we will inject into small businesses over the next couple of months. The key thing we need to monitor is whether there is a fall-off in employment as a consequence of this increase and whether we will see businesses closing at a faster rate than they would on the long-term average. We are not seeing that yet, but we do need to look out for it.	spk_18

The sad reality is that there are a number of businesses in the State which have only got by in the past couple of years because of that State support and some of those are not viable. That is a sad truth but one no Government can simply subsidise forever. On the story the Deputy tells about somebody emigrating to set up their lives abroad, of course that happens. It happens all the time for all sorts of different reasons. Let us not forget that in each of the past seven years, the number of Irish citizens leaving has been less than the number of Irish citizens returning or has been roughly the same. There is this narrative that huge numbers of Irish people are abandoning the country for better lives abroad, but the truth is different.	spk_22

#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-23	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	The issue of immigration and asylum is a very sensitive topic and one that needs to be dealt with sensitively in this House, so I reiterate my view and that of the Government that migration in the round has been a good thing for Ireland. We would not be able to run most of our public services without migrant workers. Many of the big companies that are here that pay billions in tax would not be here if it were not for access to talent from all over the world, and of course people coming from other parts of the world help to enrich our culture as a modern state. On the particular issue of accommodating IP applicants, we are in an emergency situation. The number of people on the move in the world is at its highest level since the Second World War and the number of asylum seekers coming to Ireland is about the EU average. In previous years it was well below the EU average, but certainly it is not disproportionate to what other EU countries are facing. So far this year there have been more than 1,000 people who came here to seek international protection alone, and it is only 23 January, and about 600 have no accommodation at all. In this emergency scenario we are doing the best we can to find any accommodation we can, with preference being given to women and children. The medium-term plan is to reduce the number of arrivals by enforcing our rules, but we need to be realistic about the difference that will make. It might not be huge, but we need to enforce our rules and demonstrate they are being enforced. We will have bigger centres. There will be a small number around the country that people can be accommodated in while a decision on their case can be made more quickly.We will provide additional support for communities that have welcomed large numbers of Ukrainians and international protection applicants	spk_53

We are considering the judgment, which is about 160 pages in length. I should point out that the judgment was made on equality grounds. Sadly, the court confirmed that it does not see Mr. O'Meara's family as a family under our Constitution and nor can the State. That is another reason why we need to change the Constitution. I want to acknowledge the loss and bereavement he has suffered and I know that no payment from the State can make up for that loss but we will make the payment, provide refunds to others and change the practice going forward. That will require legislation and amendments to the Social Welfare Acts to recognise other cohabiting couples but that will not be straight forward. We will have to decide on things like how long the person is cohabiting, whether we treat cohabiting people with children differently and all of those complicated things. We will have to do it and work it out but it is all the more reason to pass the referendum. On small businesses, we will be happy to have a debate on that next week during Private Member's time.

Damp, mould and cold living conditions are not acceptable, particularly when it is State-provided accommodation. In relation to Oliver Bond, I am informed that Dublin City Council is working on a design in preparation for a Part 8 planning application for the regeneration of Oliver Bond flats, including blocks L, M and N. In the meantime, the council is making a number of interventions including the installation of mechanical ventilation units and the upgrading of windows. I agree with the Deputy strongly on one point, that regeneration in the Dublin City Council area is far too slow. Senator Mary Seery Kearney has drawn my particular attention to a number of projects in Dublin 8 alongside Oliver Bond flats, for example Dolphin House and Donore Avenue flats, which are taking far too long. It was a specific item of discussion at the last Cabinet subcommittee on housing and it is something I intend to speak to the new city manager about.	spk_61
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-23	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	My understanding is that early pregnancy loss and fertility treatments can be covered under the statutory sick pay scheme, which is new. It just requires a doctor's cert to that effect. However, I appreciate and am sympathetic to the calls for dedicated leave for the reasons outlined. Some employers offer it on a voluntary basis. To pick up on what many Deputies said earlier about rising costs and the rising difficulties businesses are having, the Government has introduced a lot of additional leave, including an extra public holiday, statutory sick pay, extended parental leave and domestic violence leave. Employers are saying to us, and it is not unreasonable for them to do so, that this is a significant amount of leave. They have to cover the cost of that and the replacement member of staff. We need to do the research and look at this in the round. I stand over the reforms made by the Government, including increasing the living wage, bringing in extra forms of leave and all of those things, but we have to make sure it does not impact negatively on employment.	spk_63

I do not believe this is just about electricity prices, which as the Deputy will know are now falling and falling rapidly for businesses. It is also about lead and zinc prices, which ultimately determine how much the company gets for what it produces. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Simon Coveney and his team, alongside our enterprise agencies, have been engaging with the company to see what financial and other support the Government could put in place for the company to reopen the mine, which is the objective we want to achieve, and then to consider the Tara deep resource, which would give the mine sustainability for decades. The supports that are available to the workers are those that are available for anyone who has lost their job. They include training and education, help setting up a business, and social welfare. We are improving those. The Deputy will be aware of the plans of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, to bring in pay-related benefits precisely to recognise people like the Tara Mines workers who have been paying into the PRSI system for years and should get a higher level of jobseeker's benefit if they need it.	spk_69

Straightforward cases should not take that long. If somebody comes to the country legally and is working, making a contribution and paying their taxes, usually that person's case can be decided within months, and certainly less than 19 months in my experience. Sometimes there can be complicating factors because it is necessary to check with the country a person has come from. There are also other checks that have to be carried out. Perhaps there is a reason for the delay in this case, and perhaps it is not a good one. If the Deputy passes me on the details, I will follow up on the matter.	spk_77

It is, of course, a matter for Dublin City Council primarily, but it is not happening fast enough. It is not just the Oliver Bond complex. It is also Dolphin House, Donore Avenue and so many other projects that seem to take an inordinate amount of time to progress. Even the O'Devaney Gardens project, which at least is now happening, is happening much slower than anyone would have anticipated. This is something we discussed at the housing subcommittee and it is something that I know the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, will raise directly with the new CEO of Dublin City Council.	spk_95
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-23	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputy. I know this is a priority for the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers. From talking to my own Deputies and going around the country, I know the delays in getting a driver test are hugely frustrating, especially for young people and those who need the car to get to work or to college. We are hiring more testers and we believe this will help us to get on top of the backlog and improve the situation. I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, to come back directly to the Deputy with some more information on this matter.	spk_99
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-23	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputy. As I think I said earlier in reply to another Deputy, the Government appreciates that a lot of businesses are under pressure from rising costs, particularly those in the hospitality sector. There is help on the way in terms of a €250 million in grants that the Government will be pumping into small businesses before the end of March to help with bills and cash flow. The debt warehousing scheme remains in place. Also, we are seeing energy prices falling for business, which is encouraging too. But I do need to be straight about this. We have a lot of businesses that in the last three or four years have become largely dependent on Government support, whether that was in the context of Covid-19 when we helped to pay the wages and the overheads, the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, when we helped to pay the energy bills or the temporary low VAT rate of 9%. These things cannot go on forever. We are going to monitor the situation very carefully because we will have to see if there is a fall in employment, which we will have to respond to, or if the number of business closures is above the long-term trend average, which is 50 per 10,000.	spk_104
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-23	dail	33	Church-State Relations	dbsect_5	I propose to take Questions Nos 1 to 7, inclusive, together. The National Competitiveness and Productivity Council published its annual competitiveness challenge report in September 2023. The council's report outlined 19 priority recommendations across a broad range of areas for Government consideration. These include enabling stronger productivity growth through research, development and innovation; reducing the cost of doing business in Ireland; accelerating progress on the usage and generation of energy in line with our climate targets; and significantly improving planning, development and the delivery of infrastructure. On 29 November last year, the Government published a comprehensive formal response to the council's recommendations. This is the fourth year in which a formal response was issued by the Government to the competitiveness challenge report. This response was co-ordinated by my Department, drawing together material from all relevant Departments. In its response, the Government welcomed the advice and views of the council and agreed on the importance and relevance of its recommendations to Ireland's continuing competitiveness. The response outlines specific actions underway across different Departments in answer to each of the recommendations of the council. These include, for example, a national industrial strategy for offshore wind to be published in the first half of the year; more efficiency and certainty in the planning system through the enactment of the Planning and Development Bill 2023; the provision of additional resources to An Bord Pleanála and local authorities; greater use of modern methods of construction, MMC, in the construction of housing; an updated Pathways to Work strategy to be published shortly reflecting current labour market challenges; and stronger pathways from schools into further education and training and apprenticeships. These are just a few examples of actions the Government is taking to ensure continued improvements in the competitiveness and productivity of the Irish economy in the years ahead.	spk_106
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-23	dail	33	Church-State Relations	dbsect_5	I thank the Deputies for their questions. Deputy Boyd Barrett is quite right to say that wealth is generated by workers, but there are different forms of workers and different forms of wealth. A lot of wealth is generated by innovation and creating new things. We need to always bear that in mind. There is a lot of research showing that 75% of all new global growth in recent decades has been driven by innovation, new inventions and entrepreneurship, that is, not by people doing the same things, but by people doing new things. On the issue of skilled people leaving the country, Deputy Boyd Barrett is absolutely correct; there are skilled people leaving the country for lots of different reasons. There are way more skilled people coming into the country every year. There is net migration of skilled people into Ireland and that has been the case for a very long time. As I pointed out earlier, even if it is narrowed down to just Irish citizens, 80,000 left in the past three years but 90,000 returned. Notwithstanding the high cost of housing and the high cost of living, skilled people are pouring into this country because of the jobs that are available and more Irish citizens are returning to the country than are leaving. These are just the facts. On what we can do to make housing more affordable, increasing incomes is a big part. It is the ratio of incomes to house prices that matters the most. The help-to-buy scheme helps great numbers of people to get their deposit for their first home. The derelict properties grants help a lot too. It is good to see dereliction now falling. The first home scheme makes a big difference in closing the affordability gap. There is also the construction of much more social housing because social housing benefits everyone, not just those who are taken off the housing list as a result of getting homes. It also helps to bring down the cost of housing generally and makes more places available to rent. I took a look at the SCSI report that is being reported on today. Unfortunately, I believe its findings have been misreported. I can understand why people misunderstood it. The SCSI specifically states that the first home scheme is not included in its calculations.That would close the affordability gap. Indeed, it would eliminate it in many cases. It only applies to three-bedroom new semi-detached homes. Most people do not buy three-bedroom new semi-detached homes. Most people buy homes that are not new and most first-time buyers tend to buy two-bedroom, rather than three-bedroom, properties. As is often the case with these reports, it has been incorrectly reported by elements of the media and then incorrectly quoted by politicians, which is regrettable but happens very regularly. As regards Deputy Murphy's comments, we are not planning to introduce an Internet tax. That was one option of many considered by the working group. The disadvantages were clear. It would not just be a 1% or 2% levy, but would have to be €10 or €15 a month, which would be too high, and there would be huge difficulties in applying exemptions, which we currently apply to people on very low incomes and to pensioners, for example. It did not jump out of the report as a good option. Rather, it jumped out of the report as a not-very-good option, but it is always important to consider all options. As regards Deputy Moynihan's comments, as I acknowledged earlier, the cost of doing business is very high and it is rising, particularly for the hospitality sector and very labour-intensive sectors, such as retail, for example. We are seeing many cafés and restaurants closing. There are many of them opening, too, and a lot that are very difficult to get into, have a lot of business and are very busy. We are not seeing any evidence yet of employment levels falling in the hospitality sector but we need to monitor and watch out for that very closely. As I have said before, there is no point putting up people's wages if the net result is they lose their job or have their hours cut. We are not seeing much evidence of that yet. In terms of businesses struggling, help is on the way. A quarter of a million euro will be injected into small businesses between now and the end of March to help them with their costs. The tax warehousing scheme remains in place, but tax cannot be withheld forever. Businesses do have to pay their taxes. Members should bear in mind that some of that tax is PAYE, money that people earned a year or two ago that has not yet been paid to Revenue. In addition, we are seeing energy costs falling, which is encouraging. As regards VAT rates, for most of the past 30 years the VAT rate for hospitality has been between 12.5% and 13.5%. On a temporary basis, it was reduced to 9% after the financial crash and during Covid. In the run-up to the budget, we considered separating accommodation from food service. That is technically possible. It would take time to implement but the cost, unfortunately, ran into hundreds of millions of euro and, for that reason, a decision was made not to proceed with it. As regards Belcamp Manor, just like Deputy O'Callaghan and everybody else in the House, I do not like to see investment funds buying up family homes. We changed the law in 2021 to prevent that from happening. This particular permission was granted in 2019, two years before the law changed. Stamp duty is currently 10%. Clearly that did not deter the investment fund in this case from buying these homes. Sinn Féin is saying it should be 17% and the Social Democrats are saying 100%. That is not the way you do tax policy. We need to examine this properly-----	spk_115

Artificial intelligence is a really important topic to which we need to give a lot of consideration. It was the main topic of discussion in Davos last week. It is a powerful technology with potentially enormous benefits for society and the economy, but one that has some risks too. My only regret is that it is described as artificial intelligence. That gives people the impression it is something it is not. It is not anything approaching human intelligence. These are machines that can do calculations very fast.	spk_117

#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-23	dail	33	Church-State Relations	dbsect_5	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 to 10, inclusive, together. A comprehensive evaluation of how the country managed Covid-19 will provide an opportunity to learn lessons from our experiences in dealing with the pandemic. It will include a review of the whole-of-government response to the pandemic and how we might do better and be in a stronger position if another pandemic or other similar event were to occur. It will include a consideration of the health service response, covering hospitals, the community and nursing homes, along with the wider economic and social response. It is intended to have a public element to hear the lived experiences of all of society. The review should be undertaken by those independent of the national response and with relevant expertise. A consultation with Opposition parties has been scheduled for this week and I intend to bring the terms of reference to Government shortly thereafter.	spk_120
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-23	dail	33	Church-State Relations	dbsect_5	On Deputy Tóibín's questions, look, I was there in government both as Taoiseach and Tánaiste for that very dark period which was the pandemic. These were very difficult decisions to make. Everyone can be an expert in hindsight. We can only make decisions based on the information available and the advice that was put to us by experts. I have no doubt that the lockdowns saved lives. I am absolutely certain that the vaccine programme saved a lot of lives. We see that from the most recent OECD report, which shows that Ireland is one of only a handful of countries in which there were no excess deaths during that period, with only New Zealand, Iceland and Norway outperforming us. Of course the lockdowns had negative effects. I was among many people in government who were very clear about my concerns about the negative effects of lockdowns, not just on people's jobs and businesses but also delayed and deferred diagnoses, which the Deputy raised, which did happen. In housing construction we lost thousands of houses because of the housing construction lockdown.	spk_126
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-23	dail	33	Church-State Relations	dbsect_5	Even for something like Garda numbers, if we had not closed Templemore there would be 1,000 more gardaí today. These things have real consequences but they were difficult decisions. It was never a case of choosing between the right option and the wrong option. It was choosing between options A, B and C, all of which had pros and cons.	spk_128
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-23	dail	33	Church-State Relations	dbsect_5	Often those decisions were finely balanced. The public health advice more often than not was for deeper, longer, stricter lockdowns. That was often the view of the Opposition, too, indeed some even flirted with the bizarre zero Covid policy which has proven to be among the worst options when we see the effects that occurred, or certainly not a sustainable option as it was abandoned by all the countries that attempted it. In respect of Deputy Ó Murchú's questions about the terms of reference of the Covid inquiry, I am going to consult with Opposition leaders this week. I had hoped to do so in December but my diary just was not able to do it because of the amount of other obligations I have, particularly in relation to foreign travel. I hope that can go ahead this week. We will share the draft terms of reference with Opposition parties and discuss their views on the composition of them. Unfortunately I am not going to be in a position to engage personally with all of the different individual groups and stakeholders. We would never get this commission up and running. If it was possible to schedule that many meetings I would but I just cannot. We will find a mechanism to consult interested groups and stakeholders. On health service capacity, I agree that our health service needs more capacity, not least because of our rising population, our aging population and the development of new treatments. What Deputy Boyd Barrett did not acknowledge is that this is exactly what this Government has been doing since 2020, in the three or four years since we have been in office. We have 20,000 more staff in our health service now than we had in 2020. Yes, there are people leaving but there are way more people joining, 20,000 more in fact. We have 1,000 more consultants than we had in 2020. We have 1,000 more hospital beds than we had in 2020. We have more ICU beds and the Deputy is right that we are going to need a lot more. In terms of nurses we are now in the top five in the western world when it comes to practising nurses per head, even higher when it is practising nurses per bed. For the first time that I can remember, in the most recent statistics we are now around average in terms of the number of doctors that we have. We had been below average previously. There have been pay increases and we are in negotiations with public service unions about further pay increases. We would have liked to have that agreed back in October or November but it has not been possible. I do think that the utopian system, or perhaps the ideal system, to be fair, that Deputy Boyd Barrett describes sounds very like the NHS. It might have been a model that would have worked 50 or 100 years ago but it does not work in the modern world. What do we see in the NHS? We see longer waiting lists and waiting times for patients, lower life expectancy, worse outcomes when it comes to stroke and heart attack and lower pay for the staff.	spk_130
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-23	dail	33	Church-State Relations	dbsect_5	That is definitely not a model that we will be following. In the election we will be encouraging people not to vote for Sinn Féin or for left wing parties precisely because that is what they want to do in Ireland. It is not a good thing. On long Covid, early in the pandemic the HSE identified a need for a national service for long Covid and to set up a multidisciplinary team to develop a model of care under the auspices of the chief clinical officer. The model of care is now being implemented building on existing service provision in addition to establishing new services across GP and community services and acute hospitals, to ensure a national service is in place for those who need it. Funding for the model of care has been increased to €6.6 million this year. At present there are six long Covid clinics and seven post-acute Covid clinics that are operating nationally. The clinics currently operate at St. Vincent's and Beaumont and the post-acute Covid clinics operating under the new model of care will be in the Mater and Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown. In addition, Tallaght, St. James's Hospital, CUH, UHG and Limerick hospitals are operating combined post-acute and long Covid clinics. The HSE is working with Letterkenny to have a more definitive timeline around their anticipated launch date. Recruitment, which includes consultants in the areas of infectious disease, respiratory medicine, psychiatry, neurology and allied health professionals, clinical psychologists and administrators, is under way. To date 66 WTE primary notification numbers have been issued across all of the post-acute and long Covid clinics. As of 8 September last year, 46 whole-time equivalent posts had been followed. Deputies will appreciate that long Covid is an emerging area of medicine and expertise. There is still so much that we do not know about it.	spk_132

#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-23	dail	33	Church-State Relations	dbsect_5	Like public representatives generally, I meet church leaders informally from time to time in the course of attending official or public events. The most recent formal meeting between the Office of the Taoiseach and the church leaders took place on 15 April 2021, when the now Tánaiste met the leaders of all the Christian churches, including the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian Church, the Methodist Church and the Irish Council of Churches. I had the opportunity to meet the papal nuncio shortly before Christmas. I understand that discussions at these forums covered the contribution to peace-building and the work churches undertake on an ongoing basis at community level in Northern Ireland in particular.	spk_136
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-23	dail	33	Church-State Relations	dbsect_5	I thank the Deputies for their questions. On Deputy Tóibín's question, I put on the record that the Government is very grateful for and recognises the work done by the religious in Ireland and all over the world. Given the scandals that have affected churches and religious bodies and given the existence of religious extremism in the world, sometimes that can be forgotten, but it should not be forgotten. We will all know of people - nuns, priests and other religious people - who have made an enormous contribution to society and have given their lives, essentially, to help others. We have see that in healthcare, education, housing, addiction services and poverty alleviation, for example. It is easily forgotten that when the State was founded 100 years ago, we did not have a Department of social welfare and we did not have a Department of Health. Most people at the time did not consider these things to be matters for the State. It was often left to voluntary and religious bodies to fill that gap. Of course, things have changed so much since then. We intend to get the safe access zones Bill enacted this year. I have not had any engagement with religious leaders on it specifically, although the last meeting I participated in was in 2021 and that was quite some time ago at this stage. It certainly was not raised with me by the papal nuncio or by the Archbishop of Dublin. I am going to have to seek an update from the Minister on Saint John of God. I am aware of some of the issues facing the organisation, but I am not fully up to date.I am sure these things will be resolved by negotiation - they always are - but I will seek an update from the Minister on it today, given the Deputies have raised it. In respect of education about trans people, trans people exist. They have always existed. Now they can be more open about it, which is a good thing, but we have a long way to go. It is my view that it is right that children should learn about people who are transgender and what that means. I would prefer it if children learned about these things from their teachers in their schools rather than in the schoolyard, and from their loving parents rather than the Internet. If we do not have education in schools, I think we are letting children down in that regard. Trans healthcare is a new and evolving area of medicine. It is controversial and there is a lot of disagreement within the profession about what the right treatments, diagnoses and investigations should be. There is so much we do not know about it; we are still learning. It is very important that NGOs should be consulted but, as with any area of healthcare, it has to be based on science and not on politics. It has to be led by science. I say that as somebody who is an LGBT advocate and a member of the LGBT community. Really, healthcare has to be led by science, not by politics.	spk_142

On health service capacity, I agree that our health service needs more capacity, not least because of our rising population, our aging population and the development of new treatments. What Deputy Boyd Barrett did not acknowledge is that this is exactly what this Government has been doing since 2020, in the three or four years since we have been in office. We have 20,000 more staff in our health service now than we had in 2020. Yes, there are people leaving but there are way more people joining, 20,000 more in fact. We have 1,000 more consultants than we had in 2020. We have 1,000 more hospital beds than we had in 2020. We have more ICU beds and the Deputy is right that we are going to need a lot more. In terms of nurses we are now in the top five in the western world when it comes to practising nurses per head, even higher when it is practising nurses per bed. For the first time that I can remember, in the most recent statistics we are now around average in terms of the number of doctors that we have. We had been below average previously. There have been pay increases and we are in negotiations with public service unions about further pay increases. We would have liked to have that agreed back in October or November but it has not been possible. I do think that the utopian system, or perhaps the ideal system, to be fair, that Deputy Boyd Barrett describes sounds very like the NHS. It might have been a model that would have worked 50 or 100 years ago but it does not work in the modern world. What do we see in the NHS? We see longer waiting lists and waiting times for patients, lower life expectancy, worse outcomes when it comes to stroke and heart attack and lower pay for the staff.	spk_130
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-23	dail	33	Covid-19 Pandemic	dbsect_7	That is definitely not a model that we will be following. In the election we will be encouraging people not to vote for Sinn Féin or for left wing parties precisely because that is what they want to do in Ireland. It is not a good thing. On long Covid, early in the pandemic the HSE identified a need for a national service for long Covid and to set up a multidisciplinary team to develop a model of care under the auspices of the chief clinical officer. The model of care is now being implemented building on existing service provision in addition to establishing new services across GP and community services and acute hospitals, to ensure a national service is in place for those who need it. Funding for the model of care has been increased to €6.6 million this year. At present there are six long Covid clinics and seven post-acute Covid clinics that are operating nationally. The clinics currently operate at St. Vincent's and Beaumont and the post-acute Covid clinics operating under the new model of care will be in the Mater and Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown. In addition, Tallaght, St. James's Hospital, CUH, UHG and Limerick hospitals are operating combined post-acute and long Covid clinics. The HSE is working with Letterkenny to have a more definitive timeline around their anticipated launch date. Recruitment, which includes consultants in the areas of infectious disease, respiratory medicine, psychiatry, neurology and allied health professionals, clinical psychologists and administrators, is under way. To date 66 WTE primary notification numbers have been issued across all of the post-acute and long Covid clinics. As of 8 September last year, 46 whole-time equivalent posts had been followed. Deputies will appreciate that long Covid is an emerging area of medicine and expertise. There is still so much that we do not know about it.	spk_132

#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-23	dail	33	Church-State Relations	dbsect_8	Like public representatives generally, I meet church leaders informally from time to time in the course of attending official or public events. The most recent formal meeting between the Office of the Taoiseach and the church leaders took place on 15 April 2021, when the now Tánaiste met the leaders of all the Christian churches, including the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian Church, the Methodist Church and the Irish Council of Churches. I had the opportunity to meet the papal nuncio shortly before Christmas. I understand that discussions at these forums covered the contribution to peace-building and the work churches undertake on an ongoing basis at community level in Northern Ireland in particular.	spk_136
#LeoVaradkar	2024-01-23	dail	33	Church-State Relations	dbsect_8	I thank the Deputies for their questions. On Deputy Tóibín's question, I put on the record that the Government is very grateful for and recognises the work done by the religious in Ireland and all over the world. Given the scandals that have affected churches and religious bodies and given the existence of religious extremism in the world, sometimes that can be forgotten, but it should not be forgotten. We will all know of people - nuns, priests and other religious people - who have made an enormous contribution to society and have given their lives, essentially, to help others. We have see that in healthcare, education, housing, addiction services and poverty alleviation, for example. It is easily forgotten that when the State was founded 100 years ago, we did not have a Department of social welfare and we did not have a Department of Health. Most people at the time did not consider these things to be matters for the State. It was often left to voluntary and religious bodies to fill that gap. Of course, things have changed so much since then. We intend to get the safe access zones Bill enacted this year. I have not had any engagement with religious leaders on it specifically, although the last meeting I participated in was in 2021 and that was quite some time ago at this stage. It certainly was not raised with me by the papal nuncio or by the Archbishop of Dublin. I am going to have to seek an update from the Minister on Saint John of God. I am aware of some of the issues facing the organisation, but I am not fully up to date.I am sure these things will be resolved by negotiation - they always are - but I will seek an update from the Minister on it today, given the Deputies have raised it. In respect of education about trans people, trans people exist. They have always existed. Now they can be more open about it, which is a good thing, but we have a long way to go. It is my view that it is right that children should learn about people who are transgender and what that means. I would prefer it if children learned about these things from their teachers in their schools rather than in the schoolyard, and from their loving parents rather than the Internet. If we do not have education in schools, I think we are letting children down in that regard. Trans healthcare is a new and evolving area of medicine. It is controversial and there is a lot of disagreement within the profession about what the right treatments, diagnoses and investigations should be. There is so much we do not know about it; we are still learning. It is very important that NGOs should be consulted but, as with any area of healthcare, it has to be based on science and not on politics. It has to be led by science. I say that as somebody who is an LGBT advocate and a member of the LGBT community. Really, healthcare has to be led by science, not by politics.	spk_142
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-13	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_12	I thank the Deputy for her question. As this is my last time to speak in the Chamber this year, I also want to thank the Ceann Comhairle, all colleagues in the House and particularly the staff of the Oireachtas, the members of the Press Gallery and others for all of the work they have done this year. I look forward to seeing everybody in the new year after a well-earned break. I would like to confirm that Santa Claus has permission to enter Irish airspace and to our cross our borders on December 24 through December 25. I want to thank the IAA, INIS, the Department of agriculture and the Revenue Commissioners for allowing the necessary exemptions to occur. While Christmas is a great time for most people, I appreciate that it is very stressful for many, not least those who will spend Christmas in emergency accommodation. There are about 13,000 people, including almost 4,000 children, in such circumstances at present. However, I do not believe the solution the Deputy is putting forward is the correct one. The Sinn Féin proposal is for a temporary eviction ban to run until March. I do not think this is a good idea because all that will happen is that we will end up with a glut of evictions in April, May and June, which will be even harder to deal with. We do not want that to be the case. We know from the last temporary eviction ban - one that I voted for and introduced as Tánaiste at the time - is that the number of people in emergency accommodation did not fall. It continued to rise during that period. Once the ban was removed, we had the glut of evictions which I referred to. I do not think the Deputy's solution is the right one. The right one is to continue to ramp up investment in social housing and cost rental so that people have secure tenancies. This is exactly what we are doing. In the early part of her remarks, the Deputy mentioned that many people have a very bad experience with the private rental sector. Of course, this is true. Many people face high rents, are in substandard accommodation or may not have good landlords. However, it is very important in this House that we have evidenced-based debates, which are measured and balanced. What may be the lived experience for a lot of people or some people is not necessarily the lived experience for most people or the majority of people. The Deputy mentioned the RTB survey in her remarks. I wonder if she has actually read the survey, which is a detailed survey of renters and landlords. It shows that 80% of private renters said that they are positive or very positive about renting their current property. They said that the median amount of rent they spend is 30% of their net income after tax. Academics say that the affordability threshold is 35%, so it is well under that figure. This has been unchanged since 2019 or 2020. This indicates that affordability has been stable since then. In addition, it shows that the median rent in 2022 was €1,350, which means that half pay more than that and half pay less. The median rent in the country is roughly €1,350. Two people sharing pay just under €700 each. Perhaps most interestingly of all, of the more than 2,000 people who took part in an independent survey, 70% said their current rent was the same or lower than when they first moved into the property. That is what is happening on the ground. I do not deny for second that many people may have a lived experience that is different, but it is important the Deputy should acknowledge that survey because that is the reality for the majority of people.	spk_70
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-13	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_12	I do not dispute for a second that it is a sad reality that over 13,000 people will spend Christmas in emergency accommodation; in fact, I said so in my opening remarks. I cannot understand why the Deputy would try to claim I was saying otherwise because I did not. I also said what I thought was the solution, which is ramping up social housing, ramping up cost-rental housing and standing up to those who in their constituencies oppose things, particularly those such as Deputy McDonald who oppose one-bed apartments in their constituencies, because that is actually the area where the greatest shortages are when it comes to housing in this city. I appreciate the stories that she mentioned are real. They reflect people's lived experience. However, the survey I mentioned, which the Deputy mentioned earlier, reflects real stories - over 2,000 real stories.	spk_78

#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-13	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_12	The current situation in Gaza is intolerable. It is unacceptable that over 18,000 people have been killed so far, many of them children, and that the majority of the population of Gaza, about 2 million people, have been displaced. The death toll is shocking, and the relentless bombings and killing of innocent civilians must end. That is why I will continue to make the case in Brussels and elsewhere for an immediate and lasting ceasefire in order that humanitarian aid can get into Gaza, hostages can be released and citizens of third countries who want to leave are able to do so. I will continue to make the case that Europe needs to change its position on Israel and Palestine, to be less passive and to push for and demand a two-state solution in a way that we have not done in the past. I will be making that case strongly with colleagues on Thursday and Friday. The political and legal advice is clear that trade is an exclusive competence of the European Union and that decisions made on trade and sanctions can only be made on the basis of consensus or unanimity. As long as even one or two EU countries do not want to impose trade sanctions, it is not open to us to do so. That is the clear political fact for anyone who reads the treaties but also the legal advice for anyone who wishes to interrogate the matter. The UN vote yesterday is significant. We welcome it. Of nearly 200 countries in the world, over 150 voted for a ceasefire yesterday in New York. Only ten countries are now siding with Israel. What we are seeing unfolding in Gaza is an absolute disaster for the Palestinian people and they are experiencing terrible suffering. I do not mean the Hamas terrorists, I mean the civilians. The majority of people being killed are civilians and the majority of them are women and children. I also think it is a disaster for Israel because this will not bring them security and it will not bring them peace. It is very quickly losing support and sympathy all around the world. Even its closest ally, the United States, is, I believe, beginning to have second thoughts about what is unfolding in Gaza.That is a strategic disaster for Israel. The Israelis are making a huge mistake. It is not just about the humanitarian suffering that is being imposed on the people in Palestine; what the Israeli Government is doing is jeopardising the long- and medium-term security of the Israeli people.	spk_89
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-13	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_12	"The answer is ""Yes"". The legal advice is that trade is an EU competence. Suspending the EU-Israel Association Agreement and imposing any form of trade sanctions can only be done on a Europe-wide basis. That requires a consensus and unanimity among all 27 member states. That is the position. It is a political fact, and it is also the legal advice. I am happy to clarify that again in this Chamber. I am not sure quite how many times I have done so now. We believe the time has come for sanctions to be taken with regard to activities, particularly in the West Bank. The Tánaiste has been liaising with his counterparts in a number of other member states on this matter.

#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-13	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_12	I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. He is right to remember and recall the 700 people who were killed by the British Army in Northern Ireland and, indeed, those who were killed by loyalist terrorists. However, I want to be very clear; legacy should not be seen as a sectarian issue, because it is not one. It should not be couched in the terms of orange and green, or unionist versus nationalist. Let us not forget that nearly 3,000 people were killed by republican terrorists in Northern Ireland. I refer to the actions of the IRA and the INLA. I include in that the last Member of the Oireachtas to be killed, the late Senator Billy Fox, who was a member of my party. That is why unionists and unionist parties are also against the legacy Act. They do not believe these people should be allowed off the hook. They believe that if war crimes were committed in Northern Ireland or in this State, they should be prosecuted and those criminals should be punished, not honoured. In relation to the legacy Act, we will make a decision on this before the deadline in mid-January. The Government and all the main parties in Northern Ireland, victims and their representatives, church leaders and civic society have been consistently opposed to the legislation since it was first introduced. We are aware that many have called on us to initiate an inter-state case before the European Court of Human Rights in relation to the Northern Ireland legacy Act. The Government has received detailed and comprehensive legal advice from the Attorney General. This is an essential contribution to our consideration of the next steps. We are fully aware that the initiation of an interstate case would be a significant step that would have to be done on solid grounds. The Government is fully aware of the relevant timelines the Deputy has mentioned and of the fact that we need to take a timely decision on this matter before this House resumes sitting in the new year. We will continue to be guided by the best interests of victims and their families. It has been suggested that there is no alternative to the legacy Act. However, this ignores the 2014 Stormont House Agreement, which would have established a legacy framework that was supported by the Irish and British Governments, the main parties in Northern Ireland - with the exception of one - and civil society. In contrast, the legacy Act was introduced without meaningful consultation with those most affected, namely, the victims, civil society and the Northern Ireland parties. In addition, there was no genuine engagement with the Irish Government. This is very much out of keeping with the spirit of partnership that we believe underpins the Good Friday Agreement.	spk_102
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-13	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_12	We did try the diplomatic approach of persuasion and dissuasion-----	spk_104
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-13	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_12	-----as well as trying to encourage, cajole and convince the UK Government not to proceed with that legislation. I stand over that approach because if we have to take a harder line, we can at least demonstrate that we exhausted all other options before taking that line. That was the right approach for lots of different reasons. We will have to make a decision on whether or not we will take an interstate case before 15 January. The Attorney General's advice was clear on that. We will make that decision before 15 January.The Tánaiste and I have had some meetings with the Attorney General and others to work out the next steps but, obviously, any decision has to go to Cabinet before it can be announced in the House. One thing I would say to the Deputy, which is a sad truth, is that he may believe that by taking an interstate case the UK Government will back down. I am not sure if that is the case and it might in fact play into the hands of people in British politics who would see this as another reason for them to withdraw entirely from the European Convention on Human Rights and we have to bear that in mind too.	spk_106
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-13	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_12	I thank the the Deputy very much for that question. I am afraid to say that this is a problem all over the country and all of us have had this experience in representing our constituents, in meeting parents whose children are waiting far too long for the assessments they need and then, after that, the therapies they need. It might vary from area to area, or one community healthcare organisation, CHO, to another but it is a problem across the country and has been for quite some time now. There are a number of aspects to it. Part of it is the difficulty in recruiting sufficient skilled staff to meet the enormous need which exists. In response to that we have dramatically increased the number of training places so that more people are trained to take up positions, particularly as therapists and psychologists. It may take a little time for that to come on stream but it will happen. We have also introduced new assistant grades and have changed work profiles, for example, to bring more people into the service. There is a real difficulty with the assessment of need because there is a legal right not to therapies but to an assessment of need. While that was well-intentioned, it has had some unintended consequences. The courts have determined that an assessment of need is a very long process taking over 30 hours per child. That means resources that would otherwise be used to provide therapies to children is used in carrying out very long assessments of need that may not actually be necessary. That is a real problem which we have to try to work out in some way in consultation with the different NGOs and representative groups because if a child needs a particular therapy or treatment, it is often very obvious and it would be much better if they could get that right away rather than having to wait for an assessment of need which takes two or three days' work for an individual therapist.	spk_108
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-13	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_12	I do not think that parents having to pay for therapies or assessments is the solution but I understand why many parents have to do that because they are waiting so long. There is a mechanism now by which the HSE can refund part of the cost of doing that and we want to expand that during the year but I do not think that is the solution on its own. It might help in some cases but it is something we are willing to do, which is to refund some or all of the costs where parents are effectively forced to go privately because they cannot get the assessment or therapy they need. On the UN convention, the last Government which I had the honour to lead, ratified the UN United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It is the intention of this Government to ratify the optional protocol and we will do that. Getting back to what I said earlier, it is a mistake to think that the legal rights or UN conventions build houses or provide therapies. They do not. They become another basis for litigation and very often that ties up the staff resources and budget of the State in defending litigation and paying damages. We need to be frank with each other and with people about that. Creating legal and constitutional rights does not train nurses or build houses. It does not mean that there are ten therapists there where there used to be five and, in fact, it can actually backfire sometimes. That is because time and resources then get diverted into managing litigation, in paying lawyers and damages, rather than being spent on services.	spk_110
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-12	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I thank the Deputy. At the outset, I want to say I am proud that we have welcomed 100,000 Ukrainians to Ireland. That has been done at a time when their country is being attacked and invaded. All 27 countries of the European Union, including Ireland, opened their doors to people from Ukraine. Some of us opened our houses to people from Ukraine. Roughly 100,000 people have fled Ukraine and come to Ireland, of whom we think approximately 80,000 are still here. Of course, they continue to come. I want to say clearly that Ukrainians who are fleeing the war in Ukraine will remain welcome in Ireland, just as they are welcome in every member state, all 27 countries, of the European Union. That is not going to change. However, we have decided to bring what we offer Ukrainians fleeing here into line with what is offered in other western European countries, very often countries that have not welcomed as many Ukrainians as we have per head of population. That will require legislative change. The legislation will be published in January and, with the help of these Houses, will be enacted by the end of January. Those changes will come into effect at that point. At this stage, the changes to which I refer have been well flagged and well discussed for several months. People know these changes are on the way. Under the new arrangements, anybody arriving from Ukraine and seeking temporary protection will be provided with State accommodation, just as they are now. However, we can only guarantee up to 90 days. During that 90-day period, people here will be paid €38.80 per week as a subsistence allowance. There will be an additional €29.80 per child per week.This is in recognition of the fact that accommodation is being provided, as well as heat and light. This is money that being provided for daily expenses, and that will be for 90 days. During that period, we will work with them, with NGOs and others to assist them to find their own accommodation. Many different possibilities arise, including: taking up employment, where possible, which many Ukrainians have done and have provided their own accommodation; pledged accommodation; or staying with people they know in networks. Any solution we can find for them, we will. Once the 90 days are up and if people move out then, or even before then, they will be assessed for social welfare as Irish citizen would be or any EU citizen who satisfies the habitual residence clause. This includes eligibility for rent allowance but not for not the housing assistance payment or social housing. As we all appreciate, this is a very difficult situation. This is the biggest movement of people that has happened in Europe since the Second World War. Between 6 million and 7 million people have left Ukraine. A proportion of those, approximately 100,000, have come to Ireland and we have been able to accommodate them. There are over 10,000 Ukrainian children in our schools and over 10,000 Ukrainians working in our economy, with about 70,000 of them in some form of State-provided accommodation. However, accommodation is scarce and the numbers coming in remain very high. We are making this change with that in mind, recognising that other European countries have acted similarly and have changed what they offer over the course of the past two years. We are now following suit.	spk_2
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-12	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	We are confident that we will be able to provide that State accommodation for the 90 initial days to give people who come here from Ukraine a chance to establish themselves and a chance to find their own accommodation and their own employment - whatever they can manage to do. Some of that accommodation already exists across the system. As I mentioned already, people from Ukraine who have moved into State accommodation do not always stay there. Some have moved on to find their own accommodation while others have moved on to other parts of the European Union, so accommodation does become free in the existing former hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation. We also have the modular homes which the Office of Public Works is building and the refurbishment programme, which is taking old buildings and bringing them back into use as accommodation. All of that will continue. We have already managed to find accommodation for over 70,000 Ukrainians. Some of that will be the same accommodation, as people move out, but we will, of course, need to source additional accommodation as we have done for the past two years. In a crisis situation like this, I appreciate that the perfect is the enemy of the good. We need to use any accommodation that we can find. In many cases, it will be former hotels, former bed and breakfast accommodation and refurbished buildings.	spk_4
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-12	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	As I said in the House previously, climate change is the biggest threat facing humanity at present. We have to be the generation of politicians that turns the tide on climate change and biodiversity loss. We can do that in many ways, first, by reducing our emissions. Our greenhouse gas emissions are falling, although not fast enough. However, greenhouse gas emissions  What is required is a system change. I agree with that call. We need to change the way we generate our electricity, the way we heat our buildings and the way we travel. We need to change our food systems too. That will take time and investment. Changing systems that took generations to build up in a decade or two is an enormous challenge, and one that will take time and require a lot of investment. Mary Robinson has said we are in a very pivotal moment when it comes to climate action. We are on the verge of an irreversible climate catastrophe and, at the same time, we are on the verge of inventing and deploying all the technologies we need to make sure this does not happen. That is the challenge before us. We have gone up and down the index the Deputy mentioned a few times through the years.I think it is done by an NGO. I do not think it is an official UN or COP index. NGOs have lots of indexes, as the Deputy knows, and they are entitled to have them. The Deputy mentioned a treaty. When it comes to any treaty we would, of course, have to see it. We would have to have the legal advice of the Attorney General. Ideally we would have to be involved in negotiating it. Generally if this country adopts a treaty we would be involved in some way in negotiating it. I am not sure this has been the case but we will certainly take a look at it.	spk_6

The EU's position and the one that Ireland is advocating for at COP is that climate should be at the centre of all financial and economic decisions and that international financial flow should be consistent with the aim to keep global temperature increases as close to the 1.5° as possible by 2030. We have been to the forefront of negotiations on loss and damage and I was happy when I was at COP to announce €25 million towards the newly established loss and damage fund. This is one of the highest per capita contributions of any State. As I mentioned earlier, we have also committed to €225 million per year in climate finance by 2025, which is a doubling of our previous commitments. We are on track to meet that.	spk_12

The provision of more offensive weapons for Israel, Hamas or any other protagonist in this conflict is not part of the solution. The death toll is now truly shocking, estimated at around 18,000 people, with 1.9 million people displaced. It is difficult to know when we last saw military suffering on this scale. Perhaps it was the Iraq war or the war in Syria. Some people suggest not since the Vietnam war have we seen such violence being inflicted on a civilian population. The UN Secretary General and humanitarian agencies say we are facing an imminent humanitarian catastrophe which could involve starvation and the spread of diseases we have not seen in this country since medieval times. There must be an immediate and sustainable humanitarian ceasefire. The relentless bombings and the killing of innocent civilians must end. Ireland has condemned the attack by Hamas and other militant groups on Israel and the devastating loss of life it caused. We restate that condemnation. There was no excuse for it. While Israel has the right to defend itself, it must be exercised within the parameters of international humanitarian law and we do not believe this is happening. On Monday I co-signed a letter with the Prime Ministers of Spain, Belgium and Malta to European Council President Charles Michel, asking for the EU to call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. I will press that case at the European Council on Thursday and Friday. The Tánaiste did so at the Foreign Affairs Council yesterday and also sought that the European Commission examine the EU-Israel Association Agreement given the severity of the crisis, with particular regard to the human rights clause, recognising that any proposal to suspend the agreement would require consensus or unanimity at EU level. Most EU member states have called for additional sanctions against Hamas, which we support. Many other member states have called for sanctions and travel bans against violent settlers in the West Bank, and we have joined those calls as well. More than 250 people have been killed in the West Bank since early October. The West Bank is not controlled by Hamas. Those deaths are at the hands of Israel and should not have happened.	spk_14
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-12	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	Ireland deeply regrets the failure of the UN Security Council to agree a resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, the protection of civilians and compliance with international law, the immediate and unconditional release of hostages and urgent humanitarian access. This resolution was co-sponsored by no fewer than 99 UN member states, yet it was not adopted as a result of the veto being used. The resolution had the support of 13 of the 15 members of the Security Council, including France, which is an EU member state. Regarding the actions we are taking as a State, as I mentioned we are among a group of European countries that is calling for a ceasefire. I will make that case in Brussels on Thursday and Friday. We support further sanctions on Hamas but also the imposition of sanctions on violent settlers in the West Bank. We have called for a review of the EU-Israel association agreement, taking into account the human rights clause, and we are also providing additional funding for the International Criminal Court, which is the body that could issue arrest warrants. It must be allowed to carry out its investigation without political interference.	spk_16
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-12	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	Tusla has an extraordinarily difficult job. The people who work in Tusla are very committed and do work which I think very few of us in this House would be willing to do. They look after children who have been abandoned and abused by their parents, have come to this country unaccompanied and have endured horrific neglect and abuse. It is totally wrong-headed to in any way try to blame the staff in Tusla or the agency for that. They are the ones trying to help the children who have suffered and experienced these things. They are not the cause of the problem, they are the ones trying to help to put things right. We should not lose sight of that. It is a very difficult job for which the outcomes can never be as good as we would like. It is an accountable body established under law. It used to be part of the HSE but is no longer - it is a dedicated agency in its own right. It has a board and is accountable to the Minister for children, and also to the Oireachtas through the joint committee. I know it regularly comes in for hearings and to answer questions. The Deputy mentioned that social workers are accountable to CORU, the regulatory body for that agency. The Deputy mentioned Jonathan Irwin at the outset of his remarks. I join the Deputy in recognising his life and contribution and extend my condolences to his wife, friends and family. He was a fine man. I did not always agree with him but I know he always had the best intentions. One area he worked on closely when I was Minister for Health was reforming the rules around medical cards for children with profound disabilities. At the time, it was means tested. We changed the rules so that any child with a terminal illness who was end-of-life, and any child with a severe disability who was in receipt of a domiciliary care allowance payment, automatically got a medical card regardless of their parents' means and incomes. That was a significant change made at that time. He contributed to that change in policy. I want to recognise that in the House today.	spk_18

Deputies Doherty and Bríd Smith asked for a debate on health and raised the issue of health funding. The Cabinet approved a Revised Estimate for the health Vote earlier today. We are allocating an additional €92 million to health, which will include funding for new drugs in 2024 and for the fair deal scheme to make sure we do not see an increase in delayed transfers of care within our hospitals. That is in addition to the Supplementary Estimate agreed only a few weeks ago. Deputy Bacik asked about a debate-----	spk_37
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-12	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	-----on funding for the LDA. There will be additional funding to allow it to accelerate its programme, including important projects like Donore Avenue, for example, formerly St. Teresa's Gardens. The exact amount is yet to be determined. I assure Deputy McNamara that we are very keen to have the mayor of Limerick Bill enacted. We want to have the election in June. I believe the office will be a success. I want to make sure it is well funded, is a success and becomes an example for other counties and city regions to follow. As is often the case with devolution, it is important to set up the office and we can then add further powers at a later date. That was done with devolution in other areas.	spk_39
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-12	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	Adequate time will be provided for the debate. I am sure of that.

On Monday at the EU Foreign Affairs Council, the Tánaiste asked for the European Union to examine the EU Israel Association Agreement given the severity of the crisis in Gaza. However, any proposals to suspend the association agreement would require consensus or unanimity and the conditions for that do not exist.	spk_55
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-12	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputy and she is absolutely correct to say that comparisons are difficult to do from member state to member state, given the different costs of living and social services which are available. Obviously, education will remain available to children coming from Ukraine as will the provision of medical cards. There is an entitlement to social protection, once the 90-days in State-provided accommodation runs out, or, if they leave prior to the 90 days, that protection will also kick in. I do not think that we have ever said that 30% of all Ukrainians who came here were secondary movements; it is 30% in recent weeks or months. I will see if we can get that data for the Deputy. We have a table which compares what is on offer in different member states and we will also provide that.	spk_57
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-12	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputy. I think he is mistaken, or perhaps whichever NGOs are briefing him are mistaken, as we have called for a phase-down, followed by a phase-out, of all unabated fossil fuels. That is the position of the Irish Government and indeed of the European Union, which the Minister, Deputy Ryan, is advancing in Dubai as we speak. We would have to look at any treaty. I have not seen this treaty. I have been lobbied about it, but nobody has produced to me a copy of this treaty. Generally, when it comes to any treaty, we would expect to be involved in the negotiations of it. It is not good practice to hand a treaty to somebody and ask them if they will sign it. They are supposed to be included in the negotiations first, at the very least.	spk_59

I had an opportunity to visit Leitrim village yesterday and witness at first hand the damage done by the tornado. Having visited many places that have experienced a disaster, it was more reminiscent of an explosion than what you would expect to see from flooding, for example, or other events.

#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-12	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputy. I understand this is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. It is a Revenue interpretation.

#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-12	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputy, who has raised a number of important issues.

#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-12	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputy. What is usually done is the Department of Education looks at the child benefit stats to assess the number of places needed for primary school and then looks at the numbers in the primary schools to work out how many are needed for the secondary schools. From experience in my constituency, it can sometimes appear there is a very large shortfall in places, but once children are matched and those who may have two or three places accept one and not the others, a lot of places become free and that number comes down dramatically. However, I am not saying that is the case with Athenry because I do not have the details on it. I will ensure the Minister, Deputy Foley, knows it was raised and perhaps she will come back to Deputy Cannon directly.	spk_79
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-12	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputy for raising the important of issue of special needs in Gorey.

#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-12	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputy. There were quite a number of questions there and I will not be able to answer them in the time allowed. I offer my sincere condolences to Aoife's family on their tragic loss. I understand the HSE has received the review in recent days and is considering the serious and significant issues that arise. Its representatives have offered to meet the family privately to discuss the matter further. There has been considerable investment in University Hospital Limerick in recent years. Since this Government came into office, an additional 150 beds have been opened across the group, with 98 of them in UHL alone. Work is under way on a new 96-bed inpatient block. That is under way. There have been increases in budget and staff, and a close eye is being kept on management and clinical leadership because both are as necessary as resources when it comes to reducing overcrowding.	spk_85
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-12	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputy. I have not had the chance to read this particular report but certainly what the Deputy has described is deeply worrying and concerning. HIQA has a number of options it can take, including a closure order, for example. However, I should take a look at the report before saying any more.	spk_87
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-12	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputy for raising the issue of the former Ashbourne House Hotel in Glounthaune. I know the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is familiar with the issue and the concerns that have been raised. We are in a difficult situation whereby we are trying to manage accommodation on an almost daily basis. We are trying to move people from places to free up spaces for others. I can ask the Minister or members of his team to talk directly to the Deputy to see what options might be available.	spk_89
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-12	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputy. We keep all these things under constant review. No matter what income limits are designed, there will always be people just above that limit. No matter what rent is set, there will always be some people who can and cannot afford it. No matter where those levels are set, the same problems and challenges will arise. I should say that the whole point of cost rental is that it is cost rental. The rent must be able to cover the cost of building the building itself and not without a profit.	spk_91
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-12	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	On the Citizens' Assembly on Drugs Use, I have not received the report yet. The practice would be to present it to the Cabinet and the Oireachtas and then refer it to an Oireachtas joint committee for further consideration. I am not sure whether that would be the committee on health or on justice, or both in the circumstances, but we will make that decision once the report is received. I would usually meet the chairperson as well and have a chance to talk through the report. On Deputy Carthy's question, we are in discussions with like-minded EU states in relation to Gaza, Israel and Palestine. We are very strongly of the view that any action, if taken, needs to be on a multilateral basis and not unilaterally to be effective.	spk_102
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-12	dail	33	Climate Change Negotiations	dbsect_9	I propose to take Questions Nos 1 to 13, inclusive, together. The Cabinet committee on social affairs and public services oversees implementation of programme for Government commitments in the areas of social policy and public services. The committee covers a range of topics, including immigration and integration, with a particular focus on equality and public service reform. Other topics covered by the committee include sport, social protection, arts and culture, justice issues such as policing reform, community safety, and domestic sexual and gender-based violence.  The committee has met on six occasions this year to discuss the proposed referendums and has considered detailed policy papers prepared by the inter-departmental group and incorporating extensive legal advice provided by the Office of the Attorney General. The Cabinet committee on social affairs and public services last met on 20 November and will continue to meet in the period ahead. In addition to meetings of the Cabinet committee, I have regular engagements with Ministers at Cabinet and individually to discuss issues relating to their Departments.	spk_104
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-12	dail	33	Climate Change Negotiations	dbsect_9	I thank the Deputies for their questions. Deputy Durkan asked about the depth of discussion on the social issues most affecting people. That is very much what the Cabinet committee on social affairs and public services is all about. Health is dealt with separately, as is education and children, but that committee has a major focus on housing issues, in particular, and monitoring the implementation of Housing for All. This year, we will exceed our target of building 29,000 new homes. It will be well over 30,000 this year, which means bed spaces for 75,000 extra people, if you think about it. A considerable amount of new housing is being built in the country but, of course, a considerable deficit has to be closed as well. In recent months, there has been a big focus on the cost of living. People will be aware of the measures announced in the budget to help them with the cost of living. They are seeing energy credits reduce their bills during this billing period. We heard some good news today from one of the electricity companies announcing a reduction in electricity and gas costs. We expect to see other companies follow suit, which is very encouraging. People will also have received the double payments, such as double child benefit payment and the Christmas bonus, in recent weeks. Those are the kinds of things we focus on. I am very pleased to see that inflation is now coming down and, I hope, is back under control and will be in 2024. On Deputy O'Sullivan's question on flooding and the humanitarian assistance scheme, I join him in complimenting the community welfare officers in Cork on their work. It is possible for the Department of Social Protection locally to second staff to help out where needed. The paperwork is kept under review. I appreciate that it can be quite stressful to have to fill in all those forms when somebody has experienced a flooding event or some other form of emergency, but we need some form of checks and controls as well. It is ultimately taxpayers' money in the end and nobody will forgive us if it is found to have been misspent. Deputy Ó Murchú again raised the issue of ambulance delays in his constituency. I have seen correspondence with him on that. I have asked the HSE to come back with replies to his questions, provided it is able to. It should be able to in most cases. Deputy Murnane O'Connor talked about staffing in Carlow Citizens Information Centre. I am not sure whether the issue relates particularly to a lack of staff or just an inability to get staff. It could be a bit of both. We need to work on that for sure. More and more, we need to try to use modern technologies to help people. I am not saying a person can be replaced by a YouTube video or AI or anything like that, but they can certainly be helpful in providing people with information and assistance in a way that was not possible in the past. I understand the point Deputy Boyd Barrett made on the cost-rental thresholds. I will ask the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to examine the misalignment that may exist between income and affordability criteria. We will certainly examine that. I point out, however, that cost rental, when advertised, is heavily oversubscribed so it is not that any more people would benefit. We need to significantly scale up cost rental so that more people can benefit. Deputy Paul Murphy raised some issues around the lack of sporting facilities in his constituency. Through my work in my constituency down the years, we have greatly improved sporting facilities across Dublin 15. It requires work. You have to sit down, work with the council, and help clubs to make sports capital grant applications. In my constituency, through a lot of work and working with clubs, we have managed to improve the number of facilities people have. It is that twin-track approach that works best. I assure Deputy Tóibín that nobody has ever exchanged blows at a Cabinet meeting or subcommittee meeting. Rows in the Government are always greatly exaggerated by the media. Sometimes, I only know I was involved in a row when I read about it in the papers. That is the quality of some journalism in the State, unfortunately. When it comes to health funding, the health budget for 2024 is the biggest ever. There has been a very substantial increase in health funding, which has gone up from €14 billion in 2016 to €22.5 billion in 2024. It has gone up faster than population growth or the rate of ageing. These are real increases. We allocated an additional €92 million today in the REV. While the Ministers, Deputies Donohoe and Stephen Donnelly, have to work out exactly how that will be allocated, some will be for new drugs in 2024 because they are needed, and some will be for the nursing home support scheme to make sure we do not see an increase in waiting times for the fair deal scheme. On CAMHS, Deputy McDonald spoke about the big increase in demand for mental health services among young people. That is something we have all experienced in our constituency work. We think legislation for the regulation of CAMHS makes sense in principle, but I have not read the Bill from cover to cover. We will have to make sure we do that and examine it too. I am informed that yesterday VMware notified the Minister, Deputy Coveney, of potential redundancies in Ireland. The company has advised us that it will seek to avoid the proposed redundancies where possible and will explore that in the consultation process with staff, which will begin this week. IDA Ireland will work with the local leadership team to understand the skills profile of the affected employees and match that with existing or target client skills requirements.	spk_115
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-12	dail	33	Climate Change Negotiations	dbsect_9	I do not know. The Deputy will have to ask him. They have certainly been in touch with him, but that was only yesterday. On Deputy O'Callaghan's question on homelessness, I am happy to check up on what I said. I am always willing, unlike some others, to correct the record if I make errors. The point I made was that during the period in which the temporary winter eviction ban was in place, overall homelessness continued to rise. I do not believe I got into any particular subgroups or details but I will check that out and make a correction if I erred.	spk_117
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-12	dail	33	Climate Change Negotiations	dbsect_9	I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 to 19, inclusive, together. I hosted the 40th British-Irish Council summit in Dublin on 24 November. The theme of the summit was transforming children's lives, tackling child poverty and improving well-being. There was an excellent discussion about approaches across the British-Irish Council members and the scope to share learnings. I outlined the Government's work including the establishment of the child poverty and well-being programme in my Department to co-ordinate efforts in government. We discussed the situation in Israel and the Palestinian territories, the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, and our shared climate objectives. I also updated the council on my recent EU and international engagements including the last European Council meeting in November. Regarding Northern Ireland I, along with the other members of the council, regretted the continued absence of any representatives from Northern Ireland. We were in agreement with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland that restoration of the Executive and Assembly is in the best interests of the people there, and needs to be done on a sustainable basis. On the margins of the summit, I met with the Welsh First Minister, Mark Drakeford. We discussed our strong bilateral relationship, including the recent Ireland-Wales Forum in October. I also met bilaterally with the Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf. We discussed our ongoing engagement and shared learning in a range of sectors and the potential to deepen links between our two countries. The summit provided another valuable opportunity to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement and all that has been achieved. As co-guarantor of the Agreement, the Government’s focus and priority remains on getting the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Executive, and the North-South Ministerial Council back up and running so that all three strands of the Agreement can function properly.	spk_118
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-12	dail	33	Climate Change Negotiations	dbsect_9	Deputy Brendan Smith raised legacy issues and referred to the Belturbet and Dublin-Monaghan bombings. On legacy issues and a possible interstate case, the legal advice the Government has received from the Attorney General on the UK Act is an essential contribution to our consideration of whether to take a case. Relevant Ministers are studying the advice, considering next steps and looking at all the implications of such a decision. These include: the potential impact on the bilateral relationship; broader political and civic concerns in Northern Ireland on legacy issues; and the position of victims groups and families. The matter continues to be raised regularly with the British Government, most recently at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference that took place in Dublin on 28 November. Officials have been closely following cases taken by individuals in the High Court in Belfast. These hearings concluded on 30 November. The Department of Foreign Affairs is in ongoing contact with organisations providing claimants with assistance. Deputy Haughey raised strand 3 and mentioned that it is operating reasonably well. That is the British Irish Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. Unfortunately, strands 1 and 2 are not operating because the assembly and the Executive are not functioning. However, it is positive that all the main parties are having roundtable discussions for the first time in many months. They are discussing Northern Ireland’s public finances, which we all know are very challenging right now. I do not wish to comment or speculate on the financial package of roughly £2.5 billion announced yesterday. It is up to the party leaders to negotiate with the Secretary of State and his officials. The discussions are welcome and I hope we shortly see progress towards a fully functioning assembly, Executive and North-South Ministerial Council. The people of Northern Ireland need and deserve a functioning devolved government after such a length of time since the most recent election. I have said before that this Government stands ready to support agreed projects and programmes of mutual benefit, including through the shared island fund. If, by helping to co-fund some projects, we can ease the financial burden and pressure on the new Executive, we would be happy to do so. It is important that if the Executive is re-established, it has the best chance possible of being successful and, therefore, sustainable, and not falling again in six months or a year. Deputy Boyd Barrett once again mentioned the dire situation in Gaza. I had an opportunity to discuss family members trapped in Gaza with the Scottish First Minister. As the Deputy will be aware, he had family of his own in Gaza. We agreed that, to the extent possible, the administrations would co-operate and compare notes and information on assisting people to leave should they wish to do so.	spk_128
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-12	dail	33	Climate Change Negotiations	dbsect_9	He was not discussed. On water charges, any decision on that is a matter for the Northern Ireland parties. Water services have to be paid for. Water does fall from the sky but drinking water does not, nor is sewage and wastewater removed without considerable infrastructure and treatment plants. There are two options for paying: charges based on use, which is the most environmentally sound way of doing it, or taxation. Ultimately, it is a matter for the parties in Northern Ireland to decide how they want to charge people for those services. We have not had discussions with the UK Government on plan B yet. That Government is not yet ready to discuss alternatives to the assembly and the Executive being re-established. Once it is willing to do so, we are willing to do so. I draw Deputies' attention to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee report, published on Monday, 4 December, on the effectiveness of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, which included recommendations towards ensuring stability of the Executive. There are some very good ideas and proposals in that report. There must always be room for the Northern Ireland parties and the British and Irish Governments to look together at the institutions to ensure they work for the Northern Ireland of today. The agreement provides for this but it is a complex issue and needs careful reflection. That is best done, we believe, when we have solved the current impasse, established an Executive and returned to the power-sharing institutions on the basis of the mandate given by the people in the elections of May last year.	spk_130
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-12	dail	33	Climate Change Negotiations	dbsect_9	I propose to take questions No. 20 to 27, inclusive, together. I attended the World Climate Action Summit at the outset of the 28th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP28, in Expo City, Dubai, on 1 and 2 December. The summit marked the commencement of two weeks of negotiations on climate change, including progressing the finance needed to mitigate and manage its consequences. The latest negotiating text published yesterday is disappointing, particularly in relation to fossil fuels. It is weak and unacceptable to the EU, US and others. Negotiations are continuing and I hope that progress can be made and an ambitious outcome achieved. COP28 is of particular significance as it marks the conclusion of the first global stocktake, a comprehensive assessment of the progress made in achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. During the summit, I attended a leaders’ event on transforming climate finance and confirmed Ireland’s endorsement of the UAE declaration on a global finance framework aimed at making finance for climate action available, accessible and affordable. I participated in the global stocktake high-level event on the means of implementation, during which I emphasised the importance of delivering on commitments made and ensuring an adequate supply of finance. I also spoke at the launch of the Climate Club, co-hosted by Germany and Chile, which is a forum to facilitate collaborative work on reducing emissions in sectors that are hard to decarbonise.  On 2 December I gave Ireland’s national statement, where I announced that Ireland will contribute €25 million in 2024 and 2025 to the new loss and damage fund and will make further contributions thereafter. Overall, Ireland will double its international climate finance to at least €225 million per year by 2025. While in Dubai, I had the opportunity to meet with Middle Eastern and Arab leaders to discuss the conflict and the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza and to express Ireland’s appreciation for the assistance they gave us in evacuating Irish citizens from the territory. I met other world leaders, including King Charles, the President of Brazil, the President of Ghana, the Prime Minister of India, the UK Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of Barbados and the Prime Minister of Fiji, as well as many European leaders who I meet regularly in Brussels. I also visited the Irish delegation and met with Irish youth climate advocates, representatives of humanitarian NGOs and academics.	spk_131
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-12	dail	33	Climate Change Negotiations	dbsect_9	I thank the Deputies for their questions. Deputy O'Sullivan referred to resistance to change from oil and gas companies and oil and gas-producing countries. I agree with Deputies Farrell, Durkan and O'Sullivan regarding our responsibility to scale up the use of renewables. Approximately 40% of the electricity we produce is from renewable sources. We are aiming for in the region of 80% by 2030. We think that is achievable. It needs to be done, not just through offshore and onshore wind but also by means of solar and battery storage and interconnection. We should not underestimate the challenge in getting that done. The energy systems we have were built up over generations. We are going to try and change them in a relatively short period. That is going to be a challenge for every country, not least Ireland. Deputy Barry asked about expectations on a final agreement. The negotiations have entered a critical phase as we move to conclude the first cycle of the global stocktake. The latter assesses progress made in implementing the Paris Agreement and provides the context for countries to update their greenhouse gas reduction commitments and agree a new collective climate finance goal for next year. The latest negotiating text published yesterday is not acceptable. The text on fossil fuels in particular is weak and unacceptable to us, the Americans and others. We want to see ambitious language on fossil fuels. Global emissions need to peak by 2025, and we need to reach net zero by 2050. Therefore, the phasing out of fossil fuels in a just and orderly way is essential. While abatement technologies can play a role, they will be limited to those sectors where it is hardest to reduce emissions, like steel and concrete. Negotiations are continuing. I hope that progress can be made and an ambitious outcome achieved. The outcome must include ambitious action on mitigation before and after 2030, on adaptation and on implementation, including aligning global finance flows with these goals.	spk_140
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-12	dail	33	Cabinet Committees	dbsect_10	I propose to take Questions Nos 1 to 13, inclusive, together. The Cabinet committee on social affairs and public services oversees implementation of programme for Government commitments in the areas of social policy and public services. The committee covers a range of topics, including immigration and integration, with a particular focus on equality and public service reform. Other topics covered by the committee include sport, social protection, arts and culture, justice issues such as policing reform, community safety, and domestic sexual and gender-based violence.  The committee has met on six occasions this year to discuss the proposed referendums and has considered detailed policy papers prepared by the inter-departmental group and incorporating extensive legal advice provided by the Office of the Attorney General. The Cabinet committee on social affairs and public services last met on 20 November and will continue to meet in the period ahead. In addition to meetings of the Cabinet committee, I have regular engagements with Ministers at Cabinet and individually to discuss issues relating to their Departments.	spk_104
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-12	dail	33	Cabinet Committees	dbsect_10	I thank the Deputies for their questions. Deputy Durkan asked about the depth of discussion on the social issues most affecting people. That is very much what the Cabinet committee on social affairs and public services is all about. Health is dealt with separately, as is education and children, but that committee has a major focus on housing issues, in particular, and monitoring the implementation of Housing for All. This year, we will exceed our target of building 29,000 new homes. It will be well over 30,000 this year, which means bed spaces for 75,000 extra people, if you think about it. A considerable amount of new housing is being built in the country but, of course, a considerable deficit has to be closed as well. In recent months, there has been a big focus on the cost of living. People will be aware of the measures announced in the budget to help them with the cost of living. They are seeing energy credits reduce their bills during this billing period. We heard some good news today from one of the electricity companies announcing a reduction in electricity and gas costs. We expect to see other companies follow suit, which is very encouraging. People will also have received the double payments, such as double child benefit payment and the Christmas bonus, in recent weeks. Those are the kinds of things we focus on. I am very pleased to see that inflation is now coming down and, I hope, is back under control and will be in 2024. On Deputy O'Sullivan's question on flooding and the humanitarian assistance scheme, I join him in complimenting the community welfare officers in Cork on their work. It is possible for the Department of Social Protection locally to second staff to help out where needed. The paperwork is kept under review. I appreciate that it can be quite stressful to have to fill in all those forms when somebody has experienced a flooding event or some other form of emergency, but we need some form of checks and controls as well. It is ultimately taxpayers' money in the end and nobody will forgive us if it is found to have been misspent. Deputy Ó Murchú again raised the issue of ambulance delays in his constituency. I have seen correspondence with him on that. I have asked the HSE to come back with replies to his questions, provided it is able to. It should be able to in most cases. Deputy Murnane O'Connor talked about staffing in Carlow Citizens Information Centre. I am not sure whether the issue relates particularly to a lack of staff or just an inability to get staff. It could be a bit of both. We need to work on that for sure. More and more, we need to try to use modern technologies to help people. I am not saying a person can be replaced by a YouTube video or AI or anything like that, but they can certainly be helpful in providing people with information and assistance in a way that was not possible in the past. I understand the point Deputy Boyd Barrett made on the cost-rental thresholds. I will ask the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to examine the misalignment that may exist between income and affordability criteria. We will certainly examine that. I point out, however, that cost rental, when advertised, is heavily oversubscribed so it is not that any more people would benefit. We need to significantly scale up cost rental so that more people can benefit. Deputy Paul Murphy raised some issues around the lack of sporting facilities in his constituency. Through my work in my constituency down the years, we have greatly improved sporting facilities across Dublin 15. It requires work. You have to sit down, work with the council, and help clubs to make sports capital grant applications. In my constituency, through a lot of work and working with clubs, we have managed to improve the number of facilities people have. It is that twin-track approach that works best. I assure Deputy Tóibín that nobody has ever exchanged blows at a Cabinet meeting or subcommittee meeting. Rows in the Government are always greatly exaggerated by the media. Sometimes, I only know I was involved in a row when I read about it in the papers. That is the quality of some journalism in the State, unfortunately. When it comes to health funding, the health budget for 2024 is the biggest ever. There has been a very substantial increase in health funding, which has gone up from €14 billion in 2016 to €22.5 billion in 2024. It has gone up faster than population growth or the rate of ageing. These are real increases. We allocated an additional €92 million today in the REV. While the Ministers, Deputies Donohoe and Stephen Donnelly, have to work out exactly how that will be allocated, some will be for new drugs in 2024 because they are needed, and some will be for the nursing home support scheme to make sure we do not see an increase in waiting times for the fair deal scheme. On CAMHS, Deputy McDonald spoke about the big increase in demand for mental health services among young people. That is something we have all experienced in our constituency work. We think legislation for the regulation of CAMHS makes sense in principle, but I have not read the Bill from cover to cover. We will have to make sure we do that and examine it too. I am informed that yesterday VMware notified the Minister, Deputy Coveney, of potential redundancies in Ireland. The company has advised us that it will seek to avoid the proposed redundancies where possible and will explore that in the consultation process with staff, which will begin this week. IDA Ireland will work with the local leadership team to understand the skills profile of the affected employees and match that with existing or target client skills requirements.	spk_115
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-12	dail	33	Cabinet Committees	dbsect_10	I do not know. The Deputy will have to ask him. They have certainly been in touch with him, but that was only yesterday. On Deputy O'Callaghan's question on homelessness, I am happy to check up on what I said. I am always willing, unlike some others, to correct the record if I make errors. The point I made was that during the period in which the temporary winter eviction ban was in place, overall homelessness continued to rise. I do not believe I got into any particular subgroups or details but I will check that out and make a correction if I erred.	spk_117
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-12	dail	33	British-Irish Co-operation	dbsect_11	I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 to 19, inclusive, together. I hosted the 40th British-Irish Council summit in Dublin on 24 November. The theme of the summit was transforming children's lives, tackling child poverty and improving well-being. There was an excellent discussion about approaches across the British-Irish Council members and the scope to share learnings. I outlined the Government's work including the establishment of the child poverty and well-being programme in my Department to co-ordinate efforts in government. We discussed the situation in Israel and the Palestinian territories, the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, and our shared climate objectives. I also updated the council on my recent EU and international engagements including the last European Council meeting in November. Regarding Northern Ireland I, along with the other members of the council, regretted the continued absence of any representatives from Northern Ireland. We were in agreement with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland that restoration of the Executive and Assembly is in the best interests of the people there, and needs to be done on a sustainable basis. On the margins of the summit, I met with the Welsh First Minister, Mark Drakeford. We discussed our strong bilateral relationship, including the recent Ireland-Wales Forum in October. I also met bilaterally with the Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf. We discussed our ongoing engagement and shared learning in a range of sectors and the potential to deepen links between our two countries. The summit provided another valuable opportunity to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement and all that has been achieved. As co-guarantor of the Agreement, the Government’s focus and priority remains on getting the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Executive, and the North-South Ministerial Council back up and running so that all three strands of the Agreement can function properly.	spk_118
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-12	dail	33	British-Irish Co-operation	dbsect_11	Deputy Brendan Smith raised legacy issues and referred to the Belturbet and Dublin-Monaghan bombings. On legacy issues and a possible interstate case, the legal advice the Government has received from the Attorney General on the UK Act is an essential contribution to our consideration of whether to take a case. Relevant Ministers are studying the advice, considering next steps and looking at all the implications of such a decision. These include: the potential impact on the bilateral relationship; broader political and civic concerns in Northern Ireland on legacy issues; and the position of victims groups and families. The matter continues to be raised regularly with the British Government, most recently at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference that took place in Dublin on 28 November. Officials have been closely following cases taken by individuals in the High Court in Belfast. These hearings concluded on 30 November. The Department of Foreign Affairs is in ongoing contact with organisations providing claimants with assistance. Deputy Haughey raised strand 3 and mentioned that it is operating reasonably well. That is the British Irish Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. Unfortunately, strands 1 and 2 are not operating because the assembly and the Executive are not functioning. However, it is positive that all the main parties are having roundtable discussions for the first time in many months. They are discussing Northern Ireland’s public finances, which we all know are very challenging right now. I do not wish to comment or speculate on the financial package of roughly £2.5 billion announced yesterday. It is up to the party leaders to negotiate with the Secretary of State and his officials. The discussions are welcome and I hope we shortly see progress towards a fully functioning assembly, Executive and North-South Ministerial Council. The people of Northern Ireland need and deserve a functioning devolved government after such a length of time since the most recent election. I have said before that this Government stands ready to support agreed projects and programmes of mutual benefit, including through the shared island fund. If, by helping to co-fund some projects, we can ease the financial burden and pressure on the new Executive, we would be happy to do so. It is important that if the Executive is re-established, it has the best chance possible of being successful and, therefore, sustainable, and not falling again in six months or a year. Deputy Boyd Barrett once again mentioned the dire situation in Gaza. I had an opportunity to discuss family members trapped in Gaza with the Scottish First Minister. As the Deputy will be aware, he had family of his own in Gaza. We agreed that, to the extent possible, the administrations would co-operate and compare notes and information on assisting people to leave should they wish to do so.	spk_128
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-12	dail	33	British-Irish Co-operation	dbsect_11	He was not discussed. On water charges, any decision on that is a matter for the Northern Ireland parties. Water services have to be paid for. Water does fall from the sky but drinking water does not, nor is sewage and wastewater removed without considerable infrastructure and treatment plants. There are two options for paying: charges based on use, which is the most environmentally sound way of doing it, or taxation. Ultimately, it is a matter for the parties in Northern Ireland to decide how they want to charge people for those services. We have not had discussions with the UK Government on plan B yet. That Government is not yet ready to discuss alternatives to the assembly and the Executive being re-established. Once it is willing to do so, we are willing to do so. I draw Deputies' attention to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee report, published on Monday, 4 December, on the effectiveness of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, which included recommendations towards ensuring stability of the Executive. There are some very good ideas and proposals in that report. There must always be room for the Northern Ireland parties and the British and Irish Governments to look together at the institutions to ensure they work for the Northern Ireland of today. The agreement provides for this but it is a complex issue and needs careful reflection. That is best done, we believe, when we have solved the current impasse, established an Executive and returned to the power-sharing institutions on the basis of the mandate given by the people in the elections of May last year.	spk_130
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-12	dail	33	Climate Change Negotiations	dbsect_12	I propose to take questions No. 20 to 27, inclusive, together. I attended the World Climate Action Summit at the outset of the 28th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP28, in Expo City, Dubai, on 1 and 2 December. The summit marked the commencement of two weeks of negotiations on climate change, including progressing the finance needed to mitigate and manage its consequences. The latest negotiating text published yesterday is disappointing, particularly in relation to fossil fuels. It is weak and unacceptable to the EU, US and others. Negotiations are continuing and I hope that progress can be made and an ambitious outcome achieved. COP28 is of particular significance as it marks the conclusion of the first global stocktake, a comprehensive assessment of the progress made in achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. During the summit, I attended a leaders’ event on transforming climate finance and confirmed Ireland’s endorsement of the UAE declaration on a global finance framework aimed at making finance for climate action available, accessible and affordable. I participated in the global stocktake high-level event on the means of implementation, during which I emphasised the importance of delivering on commitments made and ensuring an adequate supply of finance. I also spoke at the launch of the Climate Club, co-hosted by Germany and Chile, which is a forum to facilitate collaborative work on reducing emissions in sectors that are hard to decarbonise.  On 2 December I gave Ireland’s national statement, where I announced that Ireland will contribute €25 million in 2024 and 2025 to the new loss and damage fund and will make further contributions thereafter. Overall, Ireland will double its international climate finance to at least €225 million per year by 2025. While in Dubai, I had the opportunity to meet with Middle Eastern and Arab leaders to discuss the conflict and the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza and to express Ireland’s appreciation for the assistance they gave us in evacuating Irish citizens from the territory. I met other world leaders, including King Charles, the President of Brazil, the President of Ghana, the Prime Minister of India, the UK Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of Barbados and the Prime Minister of Fiji, as well as many European leaders who I meet regularly in Brussels. I also visited the Irish delegation and met with Irish youth climate advocates, representatives of humanitarian NGOs and academics.	spk_131

#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-06	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	I thank the Deputy. I appreciate that a lot of renters in Ireland are paying very high rents and that a lot of people who are renting do not want to rent. They want to be able to own their own home. The Government understands that lived experience. We do not agree with the Deputy's proposed policy of an across-the-board rent freeze for three years precisely because we think it would be counterproductive. It would reduce the amount of supply, reduce the number of rental properties available and leave more people with no place to rent, and would probably, therefore, lead to a rise in homelessness.That is why we do not agree with the Deputy's proposal.  What can we do for renters? We can increase supply of places to rent. That would mean fewer people who are homeless and lower rents in the round. We do that by ramping up the supply of places to rent. We need more public and private homes and apartments. We do that by investing in social housing, in particular. I am proud to lead a Government that is building more new social housing every year than any year since the 1970s. I am proud to lead a Government that has made cost-rental housing a reality, whereby the Government provided rental properties for those who do not qualify for social housing. We are ramping that up, and will ramp it up a lot more over the next few years.  Social housing is something that benefits everyone. It does not just take people off the housing lists; it also frees up rental properties for other people to rent and exerts a downward pressure on rents and property prices. It is good to see that in the past ten years, the number of people who rent social housing from the State, and the number of families who benefit from social housing, has increased by 40,000. The figures have also increased in percentage terms. That blasts the myth from the fake left that somehow this Government or the previous one did not believe in or was not committed to social housing. Raw numbers, percentages - any way you want to look at it, there are more people who benefit from social housing today than was the case when the census was done in 2011. The other thing we are doing for renters is the rent credit. It will be €750 next year and is €500 this year. Bear in mind, that is per renter and not per property. A couple sharing an apartment, who are both working and paying income tax, can claim €1,500 back. That is roughly a month's rent back into their pockets. If three people are sharing, the figure will be €2,250. I encourage people to take up that rent credit. There was a pretty good take-up last year, but not so much this year. People can claim it three years in arrears and I would encourage them to do that. Of course, parents can claim it on behalf of their children if they are students who are renting. That is making a real and practical difference for renters. In terms of housing and being able to buy, I remind the Deputy that we are seeing record numbers of first-time buyers in Ireland, the highest we have seen in 16 years. That is encouraging. I want it to be a lot more. That did not happen by accident. It is because of increased supply, in part because we have suspended development levies, something Sinn Féin opposed. It is also because of the help to buy scheme, where we give hard-working young people their income tax for the past three years back so they can afford a deposit, something Sinn Féin opposes. It is because of schemes like first home, which bridges the gap between the amount the bank will lend you and the cost of the house. Again, that is something Sinn Féin opposes because Sinn Féin is actually against homeownership and that is the truth.	spk_163
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-06	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	I thank the Deputy. There is no need to be condescending. It may come naturally to you, but it is unbecoming of somebody who wishes to be Taoiseach.	spk_165
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-06	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	Once again, the Deputy engaged in misrepresentation and misleading behaviour, because she is the great misleader. I did not say that there was downward pressure on rents. I know rents are rising. I said that increased social housing exerts a downward pressure on rents, and that is just a fact. She knows that is a fact but it does not matter what I say. She will twist, manipulate and mislead because she is the great misleader.	spk_167
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-06	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	Of course I meet people all the time who has been on the housing lists for far too long. Anybody in this House deals with the huge number of housing cases in their clinics and constituency offices. I also meet people all the time who are now buying their first homes. I see the enormous joy when people get to move into their first home. I also meet loads of people who are getting social housing - over 1,000 people a month are moving into new social housing. There is one thing that a lot of those people have in common. They are moving into houses that were opposed by Sinn Féin.	spk_169
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-06	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	Once again, for the avoidance of doubt - not in this House but perhaps in other parts of the world - I want to condemn unreservedly the terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel where 2,000 people were killed, were tortured. We know now that many women were raped and others were kidnapped and taken hostage, and remain as hostages in Gaza today. While Israel has a right to defend itself, what it has done goes well beyond that in my view and that of the Government. Israel is allowing a situation to develop whereby 100 children a day are being killed in Gaza. That is unbearable and unacceptable, and we deplore and condemn it. As a Government, we seek a new ceasefire so that the killing ends, so that we can get aid and relief into the Gaza Strip to relieve the suffering of the people there, and so that a new government, or at least a new administration, can be put in place in Gaza that does not involve Hamas and can be one that can become the basis for a lasting peace. That is what we are seeking at EU level, at UN level and in our engagements with other countries in the Middle East, making it very clear there can be no expulsion of populations, either from the West Bank or Gaza, that there can be no reoccupation, that there can be no further loss of territory and that there can be no role for Hamas in the future governance of Gaza. That is the position we are advocating. We will do it at EU level, at UN level and in our contacts with other countries in the region. Specifically, the Tánaiste begins a three-day visit today to the Middle East. He will travel to Saudi Arabia today, then onward to COP in Dubai, and he will use these visits as an important opportunity to engage with key actors in respect of the devastating war between Israel and Hamas, in which so many innocent lives have been lost. I will use my role as Taoiseach at the European Council next week to press for the European Union to adopt wording calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and calling for the European Union, in particular, to take a much more active role in pushing for a two-state solution and Palestinian statehood, because the European Union has been far too passive for far too long when it comes to this conflict.	spk_176
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-06	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	The advice we have from consistent Attorneys General, and it remains the advice to the Government, is that the occupied territories Bill cannot be enacted by the Dáil because trade is an EU competence and that is clear in the EU treaties. Even it were enacted, it could not have a practical effect, and that has been the view of three or four Attorneys General from all sorts of backgrounds over previous Governments. The Government favours the recognition of the state of Palestine. This House and the Seanad have passed motions to that effect. We do not believe the best way to do it is unilaterally. That would be dismissed, it would be ineffectual and we would be seen as an outlier acting unilaterally at a European level. We would like to do it as part of a group of European countries, and that would be a more significant statement. We do not just want it to be a statement. We want it to be part, perhaps, of an agreement to end the violence that is happening at the moment and to put in place a new administration in Gaza for the day afterward. That is the kind of conversation we are having at the moment, for example, with Spain, which has a similar view to ours, and some other countries as well.	spk_178

The Deputy and I have been strong supporters-----	spk_180
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-06	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	-----of that project for quite some time, as are the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, Senator Kyne, Deputy Ó Cuív and everyone in the area, and I am really glad that money is confirmed for Galway city and county. Of course, it is not just about rugby or sports. This will also be an important and much-needed events space and conference centre in what is the fabulous city of Galway. One thing that would make the city even better would be the construction of the Galway ring road, and I am a supporter of the project. I cannot interfere in the planning process, but I am glad to see it is back before An Bord Pleanála. I hope it can make a decision soon, thus allowing us to go to tender, always aware there is a risk, of course, of a judicial review, which is why these things need to be done carefully and properly. I know that some people will argue the Galway ring road is contrary to our climate action plan. I do not believe that is the case. I believe the construction of the Galway ring road will free up the city and road space within the city for pedestrians and cyclists, making it more attractive to residents, tourists and investors. I also take the view that by the time it is built, and we know it will take many years to build, most of the electricity we produce in this country will be from renewables and many more people will be using electric cars and other electric vehicles. Therefore, the argument that building this road will mean more fossil fuels and more greenhouse gases being emitted in the environment is, I think, a weak one. When we take into account the improvements to the public realm and life within the city, the reduction in through traffic, better air quality and the electrification of our energy system and the increased uptake of electric vehicles, I would argue this project is not contrary to our climate objectives. I do know, of course, that any major road construction project has an impact on the environment, but having visited the site of the Ballyvourney-Macroom bypass and having seen it completed, I was interested to learn how much building techniques have changed and how things can be done in a way that has a lesser impact on the environment than was the case in the past.	spk_182
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-06	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	I will be in Galway on Monday morning and will have the great privilege of officially opening the Moycullen bypass. It is a project I was in involved in initiating when I was Minister for transport. At the time, we thought it might be possible for the ring road and Moycullen bypass to be built at the same time, so I understand the frustration people must feel that one part is done and the bigger part is not. We know the backstory to this. Planning permission was granted by An Bord Pleanála. It was struck down by the High Court. The application is now before An Bord Pleanála again. As regards delays, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and I met the chairman and chief planner of An Bord Pleanála in the past week or two and asked them what they needed to ensure decisions on major public infrastructure projects are made more quickly, not only on this project, but on projects such as BusConnects, the DART extension that is important to my constituency and MetroLink. We are doing what they asked for. They now have a full complement of 15 board members and more than 300 staff and they will be able to take on more staff. From next week, the new planning and environment division of the High Court will sit for the first time. That means that if an application goes to judicial review, the case can be heard and decided on more quickly than was the case in the past.	spk_184
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-06	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. I concur with him about the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises. All small businesses together employ more people than the public sector and the entire multinational sector combined. They employ people in every town, village and parish in the country. We appreciate that costs are rising for businesses. That is why the Minister, Deputy Coveney, got approval this week for his €0.25 billion package to help SMEs with rising costs. We also appreciate that the administrative burden for small businesses can be great because they cannot hire as many administrative staff and do not have a HR or accounts department in the way a big company would. On the specific matter the Deputy raised, the Finance Act 2022 provides for new requirements under which employers must report to Revenue on or before they provide certain non-taxable benefits to their employees or directors. They are the small benefit exemption, the remote working daily allowance and travel and subsistence payments. Employers are already required to determine the tax treatment of such benefits before providing them to their employees or directors. For compliance purposes, they are also required to record and maintain information which supports that determination, for instance demonstrating that the benefit meets the specific conditions of the relevant tax exemption. While the new reporting requirements have not yet been brought into effect, it is intended they will be in place from 1 January. The period between enactment and commencement is designed to allow sufficient time for Revenue to undertake stakeholder engagement and ensure successful implementation. To date, the stakeholder engagement process has included issuing a survey to employers and their agents, considering submissions from practitioners and representative bodies, developing technical guidance for software providers and scheduling a series of webinars for employers and their agents. Revenue will continue to issue guidance on the reporting requirements and participate in other industry events in the coming months. As with any change in established procedure, there is likely to be a bedding-in period during which stakeholders will need to adapt to the new procedures. I am assured that Revenue has incorporated information gained from stakeholder engagement into the development of the enhanced reporting regime to ensure the mechanisms and processes will not be overly onerous and that employers will have a variety of mechanisms through which they can make their returns.	spk_188
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-06	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_9	As is often the case when it comes to a new set of rules or a new set of regulations, there can be a bedding in period. Once they are in place for a few months very often they work well and people's concerns are allayed but that is not always the case, and we have to be flexible and mindful of these things and sometimes make changes if they need to be made. With that in mind, the Department of Finance will continue to monitor this matter as Revenue continues to engage with stakeholders. As it currently stands, there are no plans to deviate from the commencement of the enhanced reporting requirements from 1 January. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, who is sat beside me here, has a particular remit for business and is aware of the matter, as is the Minister for Finance, Deputy McGrath, and we will certainly monitor the situation and make sure that this happens as seamlessly as possible.	spk_190

It is part of the contracts that we have with the toll operators and, in some cases, the companies that built the roads. We have done a deferral in the past, paid for by the taxpayer, but that is something that can only be done on a temporary basis. If it is Sinn Féin's position that it is going to breach these contracts if Deputy McDonald becomes Taoiseach, she should say so because that would be a significant matter legally and would probably open the country to very significant compensation claims at the expense of the taxpayer. It is important that at some point that the Deputy clarifies Sinn Féin's policy on this because there are lawyers listening to what she says in a way they did not in the past and her words could really cost this country money.	spk_193

I think this is only a discussion document or something at that level. It is not actually a proposal at this stage so of course we will listen to people who have views and submissions on it. Among the things that we have done to encourage more people with disabilities into the workforce are grants for employers to install equipment, subsidies to employ people with disabilities, setting a higher target for public bodies to employ people with disabilities and giving people with disabilities the assurance that they will not lose their travel pass or medical card should they take up a trial of employment. The Deputy is correct that there are statistics that indicate Ireland has the lowest level of employment of people with disabilities. I would like to drill down into that, quite frankly. I do find it a bit strange that some countries where disabled people can barely get around at all perform better than us, for example in eastern and southern Europe. I think that should be drilled down into a bit further.	spk_201

It is a realistic one, which understands that we will still need to use fossil fuels for a period ahead, but not forever, and it does understand that in ten, 20 or 30 years, technologies that may not be viable now may be viable in future and carbon capture and storage may be one of those. Provided that the carbon and greenhouse gases do not go up into the environment, they do not contribute to climate change so if carbon capture and storage proves to work and to be viable in the future, we should not close it off as a possibility. There is a long-standing tradition on the far left of rejecting new technologies and it has been proven wrong time and time again in that regard.	spk_203

Negotiations are ongoing and we want to get those projects under way, particularly in SETU, but we want to get a fair price for the taxpayer as well. Sometimes negotiations take time. As we are talking about Waterford matters, I am sure the Deputy will acknowledge that this has been a good week for investment in Waterford. There was a significant announcement regarding funding for Waterford Airport to allow the runway to be extended and direct flights between Waterford and the UK to be restored. There was also the announcement today of an additional €3.3 million for Walsh Park county GAA grounds in Waterford. This represents a total allocation of €7 million. This is a Government that, at least this week, has made two major investment announcements for Waterford and the south east.	spk_221

We do not yet have a date for it. I want to reiterate that there are no proposals from the Government or, I think, any party in the House to privatise Irish Water. The fact that Irish Water has given the contract to a private company is hardly creeping privatisation. Some 100 years ago, the ESB gave a contract to Siemens to build Ardnacrusha. Come off it now.	spk_225
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-06	dail	33	Ceisteanna ar Pholasaí nó ar Reachtaíocht - Questions on Policy or Legislation	dbsect_11	I respectfully disagree. In the past two years, 100,000 Ukrainians fleeing war have come to our country. More than 70,000 of them have been accommodated by the State. There are some 14,000 Ukrainian children in our schools and between 15,000 and 16,000 Ukrainians working in our economy and contributing by paying tax and PRSI. I know it has not been a perfect response but when people look back in ten or 20 years on what we have done as a country, they will be proud of what we have done. That is not to say that it is perfect and yes, it can be improved. Part of the improvement will be the creation of community engagement teams to talk to people on the ground. These will be headed by Ms Eibhlin Byrne, a former Fianna Fáil Lord Mayor of Dublin and someone the Deputy knows well. We will also staff up the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. This was a relatively small Department, with very few staff only a few years ago.

We expect decisions from An Bord Pleanála quite soon - in the next few weeks and months. The power to direct the NTA, to the extent that it exists, lies with the Minister for Transport. He is in Dubai at the moment but I will let him know that the Deputy raised this so that he can take it into account. As people know, the whole idea around. BusConnects is to have direct routes that are much more frequent. The bus arrives quickly every couple of minutes and people get into town much more quickly. In some cases, that will mean that people might have to walk a bit further, maybe ten minutes instead of seven or 15 minutes instead of three or four. The idea is that because the bus service will be so frequent, people will get on the bus quicker and get to and from town much quicker.	spk_229

I would like to do it but we are not there yet. The indication I have is that if we did exactly what Australia did, quite a number of the survivors would not accept it, it would be rejected and they would have legal cases against the State, which is unfortunate.Not everyone says the same. There are different groups representing different survivors of thalidomide. There are different solicitors and individuals involved. However, I am happy to state the basic principle that we would be happy to match what the Australian Government has done as regards an apology and a scheme but only if it is acceptable to the survivors.	spk_246

We have all come across cases of people who have been paying their mortgages and who have a perfect payment record but whose mortgage has been sold to a non-bank lender and who now face very big increases in interest rates they would not have faced had the mortgage not been sold on. It is difficult to know what the solution to this is within existing law and regulations. The mortgage tax relief in the budget will help but it will only help a bit.

#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-06	dail	33	National Economic and Social Council	dbsect_12	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 11, inclusive, together. The Cabinet committee on housing last met on Monday, 27 November. The next meeting of the committee is scheduled for 18 December. This committee works to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the implementation of Housing for All and programme for Government commitments regarding housing and related matters. Housing for All is now in its third year of implementation. Earlier this month, the Government published the second annual update alongside the quarter 3 progress report. This sets out our priority actions for the coming year. Despite considerable challenges in the external environment, we are making real progress with new homes and apartments being built all over the country. While new housing construction is slowing down in much of the western world, it is speeding up here. In the past 12 months, over 30,000 new homes have been built. We have exceeded the Housing for All output target for 2022 and now expect to exceed it again for 2023. The pipeline for delivery is very positive, with over 26,000 new homes started in the first ten months of 2023 and planning permission granted for over 20,000 new homes in the first half of this year alone. We have seen large numbers of first-time buyers buying their first homes. In the 12 months to September, first-time mortgage approvals exceeded 30,000, well over 500 per week. In many cases, these were helped by the first home and help-to-buy schemes, which the Opposition wants to abolish. On State lands, building is under way on sites in Cork and Dublin which, between them, will provide over 850 homes and the Land Development Agency, LDA, now has planning permission for over 2,500 additional homes. This is on top of the 1,000 affordable homes due under Project Tosaigh. We are also committed to improving the rental market by providing greater security, affordability and viability to tenants and landlords into the future. To date, over 300,000 renters have claimed the rent tax credit, which will be increased to €750 per renter in 2024. We have also introduced changes to the tax treatment of landlords to encourage them to stay in the rental market and not to sell up.  The Government has responded to issues of financial viability in home building. The Croí Cónaithe cities scheme is assisting the building of apartments and the new secure tenancy affordable rental, STAR, scheme will help to build over 4,000 cost-rental homes. We have also taken further action to bring additional vacant and derelict properties back into use, having doubled the target for the vacant property refurbishment grant. The local authority home loan will be extended to people looking to buy and renovate derelict homes. Housing for All is a coherent plan designed to accelerate home building in a sustainable way. The new Planning and Development Bill, once enacted, will bring greater clarity, consistency and efficiency to how planning decisions are made. Importantly, the system will be more coherent and user-friendly, allowing for greater understanding on the part of both the public and planning practitioners alike. In addition, we will continue to enhance the capacity of the construction sector, launch campaigns to attract more people from Ireland and abroad to work in construction, promote the use of innovation in both public and private delivery and promote greater productivity in the house building sector. We are building more homes and will continue to maintain this strong momentum into 2024 and beyond. 	spk_253
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-06	dail	33	National Economic and Social Council	dbsect_12	I thank the Deputies for their questions. Deputy Dillon raised the issue of pyrite in County Mayo and whether modern methods of construction and rapid-build housing might form part of the solution. We can and will examine proposals made by Mayo County Council in that regard. Our experience with rapid-build solutions, however, is that they are never as rapid as people may believe they are. They are not much cheaper and while they may be more rapid than regular construction, they are not as rapid as people hope they might be. Often, that is not about the building itself but the site because you cannot just drop a house or apartment building onto a site. It has to be properly serviced and all of those things. That is often the main cause for the delay, rather than the structure itself. We will consider any proposals that are made. Deputy Murnane O’Connor raised the Government's policy on purchasing social housing. I will have to raise that with the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and ask him to come back with a reply. On the issue of not being able to collect social welfare if there is no address, I thought we had a solution for this, namely, that it can be collected if an address can be provided. That might not be the person's address but an address to which the Department can at least write. I thought that was the solution but I will double-check that with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys. Deputies Boyd Barrett, Paul Murphy, McDonald and Conway-Walsh raised the issues of homelessness. As things stand, 13,000 people are in State-provided emergency accommodation. That could be a hostel, hotel or bed and breakfast accommodation and in some cases it is an own-door apartment. The numbers on the street are thankfully much lower, at in or around 100 or 200, and they are often people who, for different reasons, decide not to accept the shelter that might be available to them. Nonetheless, it is far too many and that is particularly the case with families and children. Our objective as a Government is to reduce the overall number of people in emergency accommodation considerably and that, where people experience homelessness, it should be rare and short-lived and should not be repeated. It is terrible to see some people going in and out of homelessness. That is distressing for them and all of us. What is our plan? It is prevention, more social housing and more places for people to rent in the private sector. Prevention involves measures such as extending notice-to-quit periods so people have more time to find alternative accommodation. It also involves the tenant  To pick up on Deputy Conway-Walsh's point, we are providing more domestic violence refuges and they are being built around the country, as are more safe houses. The latter are an alternative to a refuge, sometimes a better one, depending on the individual circumstances. We all know this is a complex situation, perhaps more so than the Opposition would like people to believe. As all of us know from working with people who are experiencing homelessness, every individual and family has a story and a lived experience and those can be different. For example, there are some people in emergency accommodation who might not be entitled to social housing because they already own a share in a house. It could be a case of family breakdown. The family may have broken up and there is a house but one person lives in the house and the other person cannot live in it. That can make the issue complicated to resolve. The profile of people in emergency accommodation has changed. Approximately 44% of people in emergency accommodation are not Irish citizens. That figure was less than 20% not that long ago. While some of those people are entitled to social housing, some are not and will never get social housing. They could be in emergency accommodation for an indeterminate period. That would not have been the case if we were talking about this in 2010, 2012 or 2014, or certainly not to the same extent. Deputy Tóibín asked about our housing targets for 2023. Overall, we expect to exceed the targets. We will build more than 29,000 new homes in Ireland this year. It is too early to say whether we will meet every sub-target - the targets for social housing, affordable housing, private housing, etc. - but I can say that we will exceed the overall target. We discussed Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's Bill, the tenancy protection Bill, at Cabinet on Tuesday. We will not oppose it. There are some issues that need to be teased out and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, will set those out in the debate. Hopefully, we can then tease them out on Committee Stage.	spk_263

#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-06	dail	33	National Economic and Social Council	dbsect_12	I thank Deputies. Deputy Barry said that Israel has consistently ignored UN resolutions. It has been doing that for many decades.	spk_270
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-06	dail	33	National Economic and Social Council	dbsect_12	He is correct in that regard. I did not say that the US could do nothing. I am pretty sure that is not what I said. I note that Israel is not economically dependent on the US in the way it was in the past, and certainly not in the way it was before the 1980s. It is a considerable military power in its own right but of course receives significant US help in that regard. I said yesterday that experts in the politics and history of the region have expressed the view that the only thing that will cause the Israeli Government to end this war and change its policy is a change in public opinion in Israel. We have seen that in previous wars. The terrible war in Vietnam, for example, only ended when public opinion in the US turned against it. We need to be cognisant of that in how we approach this. Saying things and making extreme statements that play into the hands of extremists in Israel does not help the cause of the Palestinian people at all. I ask Deputies to think about and reflect on that. It plays totally into their hands and is exactly what they want to see people doing, so they can misrepresent our position, which they have on more than one occasion. I do not agree with the approach of expelling the ambassador. I have heard it contended in this House that if we were to do that, other EU countries would come under pressure and would be forced to follow suit. As someone who has actually attended European Council meetings on and off for seven years, I know that would not happen. We would be seen as an outlier and to have acted unilaterally, despite the views of colleagues. That would actually go against us and our influence. Where action has been taken to expel diplomats, for example the expulsion of Russian diplomats after the events in Wiltshire, it was done not on a unilateral but a multilateral basis. There are three reasons I think it is useful for us to have an Israeli ambassador here in Ireland and an Irish ambassador in Israel. We still have citizens in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories. I want them to be safe and represented. The mutual expulsion of ambassadors would not help them. We also have hundreds of troops in south Lebanon, in Golan, in UNIFIL and in UNDOF, on the borders of Israel. From time to time, we need to talk to Israel about matters relating to their security and sometimes their health and well-being, such as using hospitals in Israel. I would not like to cut off that contact. At some point, hopefully in the not-too-distant future, we would like to make some contribution to a future peace process in the region. Cutting off links with Israel would exclude us from that. Those are the three sensible, practical reasons we do not think it is a good idea to expel the ambassador. On the actions that we are taking, we are doing things that are substantive. We are increasing our aid to Gaza and Palestinians in the region. That is a real, practical help. We are also using our support and voice at EU and UN level to take particular positions. We have engaged with the International Criminal Court and done the thing that is most practical to help it in its ongoing investigation, which is to provide it with additional finance. It is clear that this matter has already been referred. There is already a case open. The International Criminal Court is not asking people to send in the same case again and again. It is asking for real, practical help, which is finance for its investigation. That is exactly what we have done. It is about resources, not repetition. I would like to say one final thing which I think is important. I have met the Prime Minister of Palestine, the King of Jordan, the President of Egypt and the Prime Minister of Lebanon. I have done all these things only in the past couple of weeks. They thank Ireland for the position and actions we have taken. They ask us to do certain things and we do them. They do not ask us to do the things that the Deputies are asking us to do, and-----	spk_272

#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-06	dail	33	National Economic and Social Council	dbsect_12	I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 to 22, inclusive, together. The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, advises me on strategic policy issues relating to sustainable economic, social, and environmental development in Ireland. NESC was established in 1973 and celebrated its 50th anniversary this year. I spoke at a conference last week to mark this occasion, which demonstrated NESC's history and role in providing research, dialogue, and advice to Government. NESC is currently working in four main areas. One is accounting for nature. The report from the council is focused on examining how Ireland can better account for nature and how natural assets are appropriately valued in policy development and decision-making. It is expected that this report will be published in the first quarter of next year. The second area is good jobs. This work focusses on job quality and the range of benefits that it can provide for employees, enterprises and wider society. It examines what is meant by good jobs and bad jobs, the range of public and private sector actions and investment, both Irish and EU, which can help build good jobs and what the literature calls a good jobs economy. The work considers international experience, including in Scotland and Wales. The report will provide guidance and building blocks to help underpin the development of sustained and collaborative strategy to promote a good jobs economy in Ireland. It is expected that the report will be published in the second quarter of next year. The third area is housing. This work is examining options that will help to promote affordable, integrated and sustainable residential development. This includes considering the role of emerging systems thinking within housing research, with a particular focus on the practical aspects of active land management and modern methods of construction.It is expected that this NESC work will be concluded in quarter two of 2024. Finally, regarding a shared island, NESC is continuing to engage with the shared island initiative. Over the coming months, this will include assisting and providing input into the shared island youth forum.	spk_275
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-06	dail	33	National Economic and Social Council	dbsect_12	I will be as brief as I can. Deputy McDonald asked about the implantation group. I think it is not established yet but I will double-check and come back to the Deputy. When it comes to climate, we produce a climate action plan every year and quarterly progress reports. Deputy Smith mentioned the all-island economy, and is often the case in the House, drew my particular attention to the central Border region. He is absolutely right. When we talk about the all-island economy we cannot just talk about the Dublin-Belfast corridor or the North-West Derry to Donegal area, we must take account of the central Border region too, which has huge potential around tourism, agriculture and food production.The IDA property programme is very successful too in constructing advance factories and advance buildings, in which investors can then invest to create well-paid jobs. We have the technological universities too, and we need to improve infrastructure, including the roads. One thing that can be transformative for the region is the national broadband plan. I saw some statistics at Cabinet during the week. Some 200,000 homes, farms and businesses are now passed, of which 60,000 have taken up the service, which is ahead of expectations. We now know we will have 300,000 passed by the end of next year and all primary schools covered by the end of this year. The islands are being connected at the moment. This is now expected to come in on schedule and probably under budget with a revised date in 2027. I am really glad that those who opposed that project have been proven wrong in their opposition to it. The four elective hospitals are in planning and design. They will take years to build - that is the truth of it - so the surgical hubs are the interim solution and are funded in the budget. We have added 1,000 beds to our acute hospitals since the Government came into office and we will add more. I join Deputy Ó Cathasaigh in recognising the contribution of Michael Ewing to the NESC. I pay tribute to him and express my condolences to his friends and colleagues. On the recruitment embargo across our health service that Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned, that is not the case. It does not apply to GPs, it does not apply to medical consultants, it does not apply to doctors on training schemes and it does not apply to graduate nurses. It is also not permanent. The HSE will be able to increase its total staffing levels by 2,000 next year, and next year is only a few weeks away. However, the free-for-all recruitment we have seen in recent years cannot continue. It has to be the right people in the right place doing the right jobs. Finally, Deputy Paul Murphy mentioned two crèches in his constituency. I do not know the details of them. If he wants to pass them on to the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, I am sure the Minister will provide him with a detailed reply. While there are crèches opening and closing all the time, the rate of closures is at its lowest in five years and there has been a net increase of 150 childcare facilities so far this year.	spk_290
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-06	dail	33	Cabinet Committees	dbsect_13	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 11, inclusive, together. The Cabinet committee on housing last met on Monday, 27 November. The next meeting of the committee is scheduled for 18 December. This committee works to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the implementation of Housing for All and programme for Government commitments regarding housing and related matters. Housing for All is now in its third year of implementation. Earlier this month, the Government published the second annual update alongside the quarter 3 progress report. This sets out our priority actions for the coming year. Despite considerable challenges in the external environment, we are making real progress with new homes and apartments being built all over the country. While new housing construction is slowing down in much of the western world, it is speeding up here. In the past 12 months, over 30,000 new homes have been built. We have exceeded the Housing for All output target for 2022 and now expect to exceed it again for 2023. The pipeline for delivery is very positive, with over 26,000 new homes started in the first ten months of 2023 and planning permission granted for over 20,000 new homes in the first half of this year alone. We have seen large numbers of first-time buyers buying their first homes. In the 12 months to September, first-time mortgage approvals exceeded 30,000, well over 500 per week. In many cases, these were helped by the first home and help-to-buy schemes, which the Opposition wants to abolish. On State lands, building is under way on sites in Cork and Dublin which, between them, will provide over 850 homes and the Land Development Agency, LDA, now has planning permission for over 2,500 additional homes. This is on top of the 1,000 affordable homes due under Project Tosaigh. We are also committed to improving the rental market by providing greater security, affordability and viability to tenants and landlords into the future. To date, over 300,000 renters have claimed the rent tax credit, which will be increased to €750 per renter in 2024. We have also introduced changes to the tax treatment of landlords to encourage them to stay in the rental market and not to sell up.  The Government has responded to issues of financial viability in home building. The Croí Cónaithe cities scheme is assisting the building of apartments and the new secure tenancy affordable rental, STAR, scheme will help to build over 4,000 cost-rental homes. We have also taken further action to bring additional vacant and derelict properties back into use, having doubled the target for the vacant property refurbishment grant. The local authority home loan will be extended to people looking to buy and renovate derelict homes. Housing for All is a coherent plan designed to accelerate home building in a sustainable way. The new Planning and Development Bill, once enacted, will bring greater clarity, consistency and efficiency to how planning decisions are made. Importantly, the system will be more coherent and user-friendly, allowing for greater understanding on the part of both the public and planning practitioners alike. In addition, we will continue to enhance the capacity of the construction sector, launch campaigns to attract more people from Ireland and abroad to work in construction, promote the use of innovation in both public and private delivery and promote greater productivity in the house building sector. We are building more homes and will continue to maintain this strong momentum into 2024 and beyond. 	spk_253
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-06	dail	33	Cabinet Committees	dbsect_13	I thank the Deputies for their questions. Deputy Dillon raised the issue of pyrite in County Mayo and whether modern methods of construction and rapid-build housing might form part of the solution. We can and will examine proposals made by Mayo County Council in that regard. Our experience with rapid-build solutions, however, is that they are never as rapid as people may believe they are. They are not much cheaper and while they may be more rapid than regular construction, they are not as rapid as people hope they might be. Often, that is not about the building itself but the site because you cannot just drop a house or apartment building onto a site. It has to be properly serviced and all of those things. That is often the main cause for the delay, rather than the structure itself. We will consider any proposals that are made. Deputy Murnane O’Connor raised the Government's policy on purchasing social housing. I will have to raise that with the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and ask him to come back with a reply. On the issue of not being able to collect social welfare if there is no address, I thought we had a solution for this, namely, that it can be collected if an address can be provided. That might not be the person's address but an address to which the Department can at least write. I thought that was the solution but I will double-check that with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys. Deputies Boyd Barrett, Paul Murphy, McDonald and Conway-Walsh raised the issues of homelessness. As things stand, 13,000 people are in State-provided emergency accommodation. That could be a hostel, hotel or bed and breakfast accommodation and in some cases it is an own-door apartment. The numbers on the street are thankfully much lower, at in or around 100 or 200, and they are often people who, for different reasons, decide not to accept the shelter that might be available to them. Nonetheless, it is far too many and that is particularly the case with families and children. Our objective as a Government is to reduce the overall number of people in emergency accommodation considerably and that, where people experience homelessness, it should be rare and short-lived and should not be repeated. It is terrible to see some people going in and out of homelessness. That is distressing for them and all of us. What is our plan? It is prevention, more social housing and more places for people to rent in the private sector. Prevention involves measures such as extending notice-to-quit periods so people have more time to find alternative accommodation. It also involves the tenant  To pick up on Deputy Conway-Walsh's point, we are providing more domestic violence refuges and they are being built around the country, as are more safe houses. The latter are an alternative to a refuge, sometimes a better one, depending on the individual circumstances. We all know this is a complex situation, perhaps more so than the Opposition would like people to believe. As all of us know from working with people who are experiencing homelessness, every individual and family has a story and a lived experience and those can be different. For example, there are some people in emergency accommodation who might not be entitled to social housing because they already own a share in a house. It could be a case of family breakdown. The family may have broken up and there is a house but one person lives in the house and the other person cannot live in it. That can make the issue complicated to resolve. The profile of people in emergency accommodation has changed. Approximately 44% of people in emergency accommodation are not Irish citizens. That figure was less than 20% not that long ago. While some of those people are entitled to social housing, some are not and will never get social housing. They could be in emergency accommodation for an indeterminate period. That would not have been the case if we were talking about this in 2010, 2012 or 2014, or certainly not to the same extent. Deputy Tóibín asked about our housing targets for 2023. Overall, we expect to exceed the targets. We will build more than 29,000 new homes in Ireland this year. It is too early to say whether we will meet every sub-target - the targets for social housing, affordable housing, private housing, etc. - but I can say that we will exceed the overall target. We discussed Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's Bill, the tenancy protection Bill, at Cabinet on Tuesday. We will not oppose it. There are some issues that need to be teased out and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, will set those out in the debate. Hopefully, we can then tease them out on Committee Stage.	spk_263

The parliamentary liaison unit in the Department of the Taoiseach assists the Government in its relationship with the Oireachtas. It works with the Office of the Government Chief Whip on issues that arise at the Business Committee and the Committee on Standing Orders and Dáil Reform, including Dáil reform proposals and amendments to Standing Orders. The unit helps the Office of the Government Chief Whip in the implementation of the Government’s legislation programme. It also assists the office of the leader of the Green Party in work relating to Cabinet, Cabinet committees and oversight of the programme for Government. The parliamentary liaison unit provides detailed information on upcoming matters in the Dáil and Seanad, highlights any new Oireachtas reform issues and provides assistance in establishing the new processes arising from Dáil reform. The unit is staffed as follows: one principal officer; one administrative officer; one higher executive officer; and there is one vacancy for the position of clerical officer. There are four positions in total, with one vacancy.	spk_264
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-06	dail	33	Departmental Offices	dbsect_14	I thank Deputies. Deputy Barry said that Israel has consistently ignored UN resolutions. It has been doing that for many decades.	spk_270
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-06	dail	33	Departmental Offices	dbsect_14	He is correct in that regard. I did not say that the US could do nothing. I am pretty sure that is not what I said. I note that Israel is not economically dependent on the US in the way it was in the past, and certainly not in the way it was before the 1980s. It is a considerable military power in its own right but of course receives significant US help in that regard. I said yesterday that experts in the politics and history of the region have expressed the view that the only thing that will cause the Israeli Government to end this war and change its policy is a change in public opinion in Israel. We have seen that in previous wars. The terrible war in Vietnam, for example, only ended when public opinion in the US turned against it. We need to be cognisant of that in how we approach this. Saying things and making extreme statements that play into the hands of extremists in Israel does not help the cause of the Palestinian people at all. I ask Deputies to think about and reflect on that. It plays totally into their hands and is exactly what they want to see people doing, so they can misrepresent our position, which they have on more than one occasion. I do not agree with the approach of expelling the ambassador. I have heard it contended in this House that if we were to do that, other EU countries would come under pressure and would be forced to follow suit. As someone who has actually attended European Council meetings on and off for seven years, I know that would not happen. We would be seen as an outlier and to have acted unilaterally, despite the views of colleagues. That would actually go against us and our influence. Where action has been taken to expel diplomats, for example the expulsion of Russian diplomats after the events in Wiltshire, it was done not on a unilateral but a multilateral basis. There are three reasons I think it is useful for us to have an Israeli ambassador here in Ireland and an Irish ambassador in Israel. We still have citizens in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories. I want them to be safe and represented. The mutual expulsion of ambassadors would not help them. We also have hundreds of troops in south Lebanon, in Golan, in UNIFIL and in UNDOF, on the borders of Israel. From time to time, we need to talk to Israel about matters relating to their security and sometimes their health and well-being, such as using hospitals in Israel. I would not like to cut off that contact. At some point, hopefully in the not-too-distant future, we would like to make some contribution to a future peace process in the region. Cutting off links with Israel would exclude us from that. Those are the three sensible, practical reasons we do not think it is a good idea to expel the ambassador. On the actions that we are taking, we are doing things that are substantive. We are increasing our aid to Gaza and Palestinians in the region. That is a real, practical help. We are also using our support and voice at EU and UN level to take particular positions. We have engaged with the International Criminal Court and done the thing that is most practical to help it in its ongoing investigation, which is to provide it with additional finance. It is clear that this matter has already been referred. There is already a case open. The International Criminal Court is not asking people to send in the same case again and again. It is asking for real, practical help, which is finance for its investigation. That is exactly what we have done. It is about resources, not repetition. I would like to say one final thing which I think is important. I have met the Prime Minister of Palestine, the King of Jordan, the President of Egypt and the Prime Minister of Lebanon. I have done all these things only in the past couple of weeks. They thank Ireland for the position and actions we have taken. They ask us to do certain things and we do them. They do not ask us to do the things that the Deputies are asking us to do, and-----	spk_272

#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-06	dail	33	National Economic and Social Council	dbsect_15	I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 to 22, inclusive, together. The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, advises me on strategic policy issues relating to sustainable economic, social, and environmental development in Ireland. NESC was established in 1973 and celebrated its 50th anniversary this year. I spoke at a conference last week to mark this occasion, which demonstrated NESC's history and role in providing research, dialogue, and advice to Government. NESC is currently working in four main areas. One is accounting for nature. The report from the council is focused on examining how Ireland can better account for nature and how natural assets are appropriately valued in policy development and decision-making. It is expected that this report will be published in the first quarter of next year. The second area is good jobs. This work focusses on job quality and the range of benefits that it can provide for employees, enterprises and wider society. It examines what is meant by good jobs and bad jobs, the range of public and private sector actions and investment, both Irish and EU, which can help build good jobs and what the literature calls a good jobs economy. The work considers international experience, including in Scotland and Wales. The report will provide guidance and building blocks to help underpin the development of sustained and collaborative strategy to promote a good jobs economy in Ireland. It is expected that the report will be published in the second quarter of next year. The third area is housing. This work is examining options that will help to promote affordable, integrated and sustainable residential development. This includes considering the role of emerging systems thinking within housing research, with a particular focus on the practical aspects of active land management and modern methods of construction.It is expected that this NESC work will be concluded in quarter two of 2024. Finally, regarding a shared island, NESC is continuing to engage with the shared island initiative. Over the coming months, this will include assisting and providing input into the shared island youth forum.	spk_275
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-06	dail	33	National Economic and Social Council	dbsect_15	I will be as brief as I can. Deputy McDonald asked about the implantation group. I think it is not established yet but I will double-check and come back to the Deputy. When it comes to climate, we produce a climate action plan every year and quarterly progress reports. Deputy Smith mentioned the all-island economy, and is often the case in the House, drew my particular attention to the central Border region. He is absolutely right. When we talk about the all-island economy we cannot just talk about the Dublin-Belfast corridor or the North-West Derry to Donegal area, we must take account of the central Border region too, which has huge potential around tourism, agriculture and food production.The IDA property programme is very successful too in constructing advance factories and advance buildings, in which investors can then invest to create well-paid jobs. We have the technological universities too, and we need to improve infrastructure, including the roads. One thing that can be transformative for the region is the national broadband plan. I saw some statistics at Cabinet during the week. Some 200,000 homes, farms and businesses are now passed, of which 60,000 have taken up the service, which is ahead of expectations. We now know we will have 300,000 passed by the end of next year and all primary schools covered by the end of this year. The islands are being connected at the moment. This is now expected to come in on schedule and probably under budget with a revised date in 2027. I am really glad that those who opposed that project have been proven wrong in their opposition to it. The four elective hospitals are in planning and design. They will take years to build - that is the truth of it - so the surgical hubs are the interim solution and are funded in the budget. We have added 1,000 beds to our acute hospitals since the Government came into office and we will add more. I join Deputy Ó Cathasaigh in recognising the contribution of Michael Ewing to the NESC. I pay tribute to him and express my condolences to his friends and colleagues. On the recruitment embargo across our health service that Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned, that is not the case. It does not apply to GPs, it does not apply to medical consultants, it does not apply to doctors on training schemes and it does not apply to graduate nurses. It is also not permanent. The HSE will be able to increase its total staffing levels by 2,000 next year, and next year is only a few weeks away. However, the free-for-all recruitment we have seen in recent years cannot continue. It has to be the right people in the right place doing the right jobs. Finally, Deputy Paul Murphy mentioned two crèches in his constituency. I do not know the details of them. If he wants to pass them on to the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, I am sure the Minister will provide him with a detailed reply. While there are crèches opening and closing all the time, the rate of closures is at its lowest in five years and there has been a net increase of 150 childcare facilities so far this year.	spk_290
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-06	dail	33	Pre-European Council Meeting: Statements	dbsect_16	I will participate in the December meeting of the European Council in Brussels next Thursday and Friday. The agenda will cover EU enlargement, Ukraine, the Middle East and the mid-term review of the multi-annual financial framework. There will also be discussions on security and defence, migration and certain items relating to external relations. European Council President Charles Michel will report back on consultative meetings he has been holding with leaders in EU capitals to develop the EU's strategic agenda for 2024 to 2029. In my statement I will cover the situation in the Middle East, Ukraine, including Ukraine's EU accession ambitions, the review of the multi-annual financial framework, and work to prepare the EU strategic agenda. In his remarks, the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, will cover other aspects of enlargement, security, defence and migration. It is extremely distressing that the truce between Israel and Hamas has been brought to an end. The seven-day truce saw over 100 hostages released from Gaza and the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, many of them women and teenage boys detained without trial. We call for an end to the practice of administrative detention by Israel. I know all in this House were relieved to learn of the release of nine-year-old Irish citizen Emily Hand. The Government worked hard with our partners in the region to facilitate 56 Irish citizens to leave Gaza. We will continue to engage with international partners to ensure that Irish citizens and accompanying dependants wishing to leave the territory can do so safely. Our thoughts, of course, continue to be with those who are still being held hostage and those who have been subjected to indiscriminate attacks and unprovoked violence. I am thinking of the aid workers, the journalists and the citizens of Palestine and Israel, who are innocent in this appalling situation and whose lives have been needlessly destroyed. We condemn all those who seek to cause suffering of others. Ireland continues to reiterate our call for all hostages to be released immediately and unconditionally. The truce also enabled the delivery of vital humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza. Despite this, the UN reports that the volume of aid entering Gaza is not sufficient to meet the extensive needs of the people there. That is why we will continue to call for the establishment of a sustainable humanitarian ceasefire. The high number of civilian casualties, particularly children, in the Gaza Strip is deeply shocking. International humanitarian law, which includes an obligation to protect civilians, applies in all conflicts and all circumstances and to state and non-state actors alike. The Government is deeply concerned about rising violence and deaths in the West Bank, including increased incidents of settler violence and displacement of Palestinian communities. This is unacceptable. We offer our heartfelt condolences to the families of two children killed in Jenin last week, during an operation by the Israeli security services. Ireland has stressed that the protection of civilians must be paramount and is obligated by international law. The settler violence against Palestinians in their homes and on their farms is provocative and risks escalation of the current phase of the conflict. I also offer my condolences to the families of the three people killed in the terror attack in Jerusalem. Terrorism is never the answer. Violence is never the answer. Ireland will continue to work with our EU partners and the UN to support efforts to combat terrorism wherever it exists. The international community must work urgently to de-escalate the situation in Israel and Palestine. We call for a durable ceasefire and have engaged with multiple regional partners to that end. Most recently, on the sidelines of COP28, I discussed the situation with many leaders, including those from the region. Among them were King Abdullah of Jordan, the Emir of Qatar, the President and the foreign minister of Egypt, the President of the UAE, the Prime Minister of Lebanon and the Prime Minister of Iraq. The Tánaiste is in the region visiting Saudi Arabia as we speak. We also discussed the role of the international community as the conflict enters its third month, and I reiterated the need to focus on a pathway to peace. Ireland has been very clear that continued and increased development and humanitarian aid for the Palestinian people is absolutely essential. We welcome the rapid conclusion of the Commission's review of EU aid to Palestine. As we had always expected, the review shows that there is no evidence that money has been diverted for unintended purposes, and that in turn shows that the Commission's existing controls and safeguards work well. I also welcome the quadrupling of the EU's humanitarian support to the Palestinian people to €100 million. Ireland has contributed an additional €13 million in humanitarian assistance in addition to our annual development and humanitarian budget of €29 million. At the December European Council, leaders will discuss the latest developments in the Middle East, notably the humanitarian situation and the prospects for reviving a political process on the basis of a two-state solution. The situation will continue to evolve between now and the Council meeting, and leaders will respond accordingly. I believe Europe needs to unite around a new push for a two-state solution and an end to terrorism and occupation. The situation in Ukraine continues to be a matter of grave concern. Ukrainian civilians are bearing the brunt of Russian aggression as Russia continues to target indiscriminately civilian infrastructure. We are heading into another difficult winter, with likely further attacks on energy infrastructure and civilian targets by Russia. Ireland has committed over €210 million in assistance to the Ukrainian people since the war began in February 2022. We are also hosting over 100,000 Ukrainians in Ireland, 70,000 of whom are in State-provided accommodation. The December European Council will seek to find agreement on the EU's future security commitments to Ukraine, which will be informed by a report from the high representative, Mr. Borrell. The package will assist Ukraine financially, including helping it to maintain essential public services, ensure macroeconomic stability and restore critical infrastructure destroyed by Russia. An agreement will be sought under the mid-term review of the multi-annual financial framework or, potentially, separately, should other issues hold up agreement on the MFF. A decision is also proposed on increasing military assistance through the European Peace Facility and the EU military assistance mission, EUMAM. Ireland's security assistance to Ukraine is and will continue to be directed exclusively towards non-lethal aid. Leaders will consider commitments to the Ukraine peace formula, proposals on extraordinary revenues stemming from immobilised Russian assets and, it is hoped, welcome agreement on the 12th package of sanctions. We firmly endorse President Zelenskyy's peace formula. There can be no doubt that it is up to Ukraine to determine the terms and conditions and timelines for any peace agreement or the timing of any ceasefire.While providing assistance to Ukraine, Ireland has been to the fore in working to ensure there are consequences for Russia as a result of its illegal invasion of a neighbouring country, a democratic and sovereign state. This includes endorsement for strong sanctions and engagement on accountability mechanisms across the multilateral system. Discussions on the 12th package of sanctions against Russia are ongoing. Building on the measures introduced in the 11th package, there will be a continued focus on strengthening implementation and combatting circumvention. A decision will also be taken, as part of the broader discussion at the Council on EU enlargement, on whether to open negotiations with Ukraine on its accession to the EU. The Commission’s enlargement report, published in November, has recommended opening negotiations and Ireland is strongly in favour of Ukraine's EU path. The same goes for Moldova. While Ukraine will need to progress a range of reforms that is likely to take some time, extending EU membership to Ukraine is also central to guaranteeing Ukraine’s broader economic and societal stability and security. Leaders will revert next week to the proposed revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027. This is the EU's budget. Further to our discussion in October, it remains the case that the goal of reaching an agreement as soon as possible is one that is shared by most member states but this goal is not yet reflected to the same extent in the level of new moneys that should be committed to new priorities. The political context for striking an overall agreement also is no less challenging than in October, including having regard to current budgetary difficulties in Germany, negotiations to form a new government in the Netherlands and indications from Hungary that it may block agreement on this and other agenda items. However, broad-based support on providing sustainable multi-annual funding to Ukraine continues to provide a strong foundation for our wider discussion. This €50 billion Ukraine package accounts for around half of the overall amount that formed the basis of the proposals made by the Commission in June. The multi-annual funding package proposed for the period to 2027 comprises €19 billion in grants, and a further €33 billion in guaranteed loans. Member states also agree on the need to ensure Ukraine’s ownership of its recovery and reconstruction, and appropriate alignment of this financial support to the reforms and investments that will be advanced as part of a future accession plan to be prepared by the Ukrainian Government. As well as the €50 billion package, the Commission’s proposals in June also proposed a further €49 billion in new spending on priorities such as migration and external action, and mobilising new investments in strategically important technologies, as well as some technical adjustments to take account of higher interest costs. As the Spanish Presidency has highlighted, member state views on these other elements of the proposed package continue to diverge quite significantly. Differing views include the extent to which there may be further potential to redeploy unallocated funds to new priorities, as well as the extent to which proposed new spending is fully warranted. Work in the Council is ongoing at both the technical and political levels ahead of next week’s meeting. Ireland is deeply and constructively engaged. We hope to be part of efforts to strike an overall agreement, including through our commitment to ensuring that the EU budget is always funded and managed in the most cost-effective way. The European Council President, Charles Michel, will provide an update to leaders on the work to prepare the EU Strategic Agenda 2024-2029. This is a keynote reference document, agreed by the European Council that sets out the priority areas of the Union’s policy. It guides the work of the European Council and provides guidance for the work programmes of other EU institutions for the forthcoming legislative term after next June’s European elections. President Michel wrote letters to leaders in June 2023, setting out proposed priorities for the years ahead in the areas of EU external relations, security and defence, energy challenges, our economic and social base, migration and the protection and promotion of EU values. Work on the future agenda was launched at the informal meeting of members of the European Council in Granada in October, and continued via a series of smaller meetings in Berlin, Copenhagen, Zagreb and Paris in November. I attended the round of talks hosted by President Michel and the Danish Prime Minister, Mette Frederiksen, in Copenhagen, with the Prime Ministers of Finland, Sweden, Bulgaria and Latvia. During the meetings, we discussed the future direction of policy, budget, and decision-making, including preparations for a greatly enlarged European Union. These conversations are necessary and welcome, as much has changed since we developed the last strategic agenda in 2018 and 2019. We have faced unexpected and unprecedented challenges, which tested us as a Union and we rose to them. We need to absorb the lessons we have learned from these crises, as we consider the upcoming legislative period. Following the December European Council meeting, President Michel will begin to formulate proposals to be considered at a further round of consultations in the new year, before the work is concluded by the European Council in June. Ireland will continue to reflect on our priorities as a fully engaged and enthusiastic member of the European Union and we will feed into the development of the strategic agenda in the months and years ahead. In his remarks, the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, will consider enlargement, security and defence and migration policy. Immediately prior to the European Council meeting, I will join fellow EU leaders for a summit with the leaders of countries in the western Balkans to discuss their future EU perspective. I will update the House again in the new year following the meeting of the European Council next week.	spk_291
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-05	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	We have rent pressure zones in Ireland. We introduced them many years ago and the vast majority of people renting in Ireland are covered and protected by them. That means there are increases of between 0% and 4% per year. We have also introduced the rent tax credit and that is a big help for a lot of people.Next year, it is €750 a year for a single person and €1,500 a year for a couple who are renting together. That, in many cases, is a month's rent back in renters' pockets. Deputy McDonald mentioned some figures that were out in the past couple of days. Those figures show that the average rent paid by somebody in Ireland in an existing tenancy is around €1,300 a month, which is per property, not per renter. It is obviously higher in Dublin and lower outside of Dublin and the major cities. The figures the Deputy specifically referred to relate to new tenancies. New tenancies are properties that are being put on the market and rented out for the first time. Where an existing tenancy is rolled over, the rent pressure zone continues to apply. Rent pressure zones do not apply to properties being put on the market for the first time. The obvious difficulty with what Deputy McDonald proposes is that if one imposes a rent freeze on a property that is being rented for the first time, it only applies after it has been rented out. That is the difficulty with what the Deputy proposes. The problem that we see in imposing rent freezes for three years, which is Sinn Féin's policy, is that it would almost certainly reduce new supply. What we desperately need in Ireland is new supply of homes of all types, including homes for people to purchase, social housing and also homes for people to rent. Sinn Féin's policy would mean fewer properties being available for people to rent. That might be of benefit to people who are renting already but it would pull up the ladder on people who need to rent for the first time, for example, young people, students who are getting their first job, and new arrivals to this country such as nurses coming to work in our health service, or indeed people coming back from Australia, the UK and places they may have migrated to. I have good news for Deputy McDonald when it comes to homeownership. We are seeing record numbers of first-time buyers. We have not seen the numbers of first-time buyers that we have seen recently for 16 years. About 500 first-time mortgages are being drawn down every week and about 400 people buy their first home. We have not seen that in 16 years. That is happening because of some of the policies that Government has put forward, including increasing housing supply, reducing the cost of building new homes by getting rid of development levies or suspending them, which Sinn Féin is opposed to, the help to buy scheme, which Sinn Féin is opposed to, giving people their taxes back to help with a deposit when they are buying a new home, and also schemes like first home. These are all things that Sinn Féin would take away from people and Deputy McDonald needs to be honest about that. Sinn Féin is not a party of homeownership. It wants to take away from people all the things that the Government has put in place to help people buy a first home.	spk_2

Is that really a collapse?By the way, just in case the Deputy is not aware, percentages have to add up to 100.

#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-05	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I thank the Deputy. I share her horror about what is continuing to unfold in Gaza. I do not think anyone could find the current situation to be anything more than unbearable, quite frankly, to see thousands of people being killed and thousands of children losing their lives. While Israel has the right to defend itself, the actions it has taken, in my view and that of the Government, are disproportionate and will ultimately be counterproductive. We know from history that when people are treated in that way, it strengthens their resolve. As the Americans have said in recent days, Israel might achieve a military victory but it is very likely to be a strategic defeat of its own long-term security.I was glad to hear the American authorities use that language and put across that message. As regards the questions the Deputy asked about Israel's actions in Gaza and the international community, I do not speak for Israel and I do not speak for the international community. I can speak only for the Irish Government, and our position is very clear: that there should be a new ceasefire, that that ceasefire should be an extended one if not a permanent one and that it should be observed by all sides, not just by Israel but also by Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the Palestinian militant groups that have committed and are committing terrible actions also. We do not have the legal advice back yet. I have asked for it but I do not have it back yet. I hope to have it back soon. As regards sanctions, I can only say what I have said before. Sanctions are effective only when they are done on a multilateral basis. I do not believe it would be the right thing for Ireland to engage in imposing unilateral sanctions. There would be a response. There would almost certainly be retaliation, not just from Israel but perhaps from others. That would create problems for us and disadvantages for our citizens and would not be effective in changing the mind of the Israeli Government. I think the Deputy knows that as well as I do. Sanctions can be effective only if they are done on a multilateral basis. We are one of the countries that is listened to on an international basis. I attended the COP in Dubai in recent days. I had a chance to speak to many representatives of countries from the Arab world and the global south. They recognise the position Ireland is taking as one of leadership within the European Union and recognise that we are not applying double standards in the way some countries are. If, however, we go out on a limb and take unilateral actions, we will be listened to less. It might make us feel better but it will not do any good for the Palestinian people.	spk_21
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-05	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	We are doing a lot as a country on an international stage, and both the Tánaiste and I have been very active on this issue. When I met people from all over the world in Dubai in recent days, from the Arab world and from the global south in particular, they were very appreciative of and thankful for the Irish position, a position we have been taking, which is not one of double standards. That is something we will continue. We have done a lot of work to help our citizens to get out of Gaza, we have done a lot of work to make sure that humanitarian aid could get into Gaza, and we will continue that work. I do take exception to the idea that there is something the Irish Government is not doing that would stop the killing in Gaza. I do not think that is a fair comment, if that is what the Deputy meant. It is almost trying to blame the Irish Government and the Irish people for the actions of Israel and-----	spk_23

#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-05	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue. At a time of misinformation and disinformation, and at a time that is so often amplified online, the importance of quality media and public service broadcasting has never been so valid. That includes RTÉ and national media but also includes local media, including local broadcasters and newspapers, many of which employ a lot of people and many of which are struggling financially at the moment. The Deputy mentioned the recommendation from the Future of Media Commission to establish a new media fund through which a wider range of outlets and platforms could be supported in the provision of public service content. A total of €6 million is being allocated in the budget, through the appropriations Bill that was approved by the Cabinet today, to establish this fund on an administrative basis. Priority is being given to two projects the Deputy mentioned. One is local democracy reporting and the other is courts reporting. Courts reporting will enable local media to cover what is going on in the District Court in particular in their own localities, and the local democracy reporting scheme will be there to cover what goes on, for example, at council meetings and other important local events. A total of €6 million has been allocated for this to be established next year. The Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, and Coimisiún na Meán are developing these schemes. This has to be notified to the European Commission because there may be an issue with state aid and Government subsidies. We do not think this will be a big problem but because it involves a Government subsidy or Government state aid to private business it has to be done. Subject to state aid approval, these two new schemes will be in place in 2024 with a budget of €6 million to back them. We hope to have them in place, if at all possible, before the local and European elections next June.	spk_29
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-05	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I know independent broadcasters and Local Ireland have been briefing TDs and Senators from all parties. Indeed, they met a delegation from my own parliamentary party to discuss the situation only in the last two weeks. We are very keen to press ahead with this new funding of €6 million, the local democracy reporting fund and the courts reporting fund. This will be of particular benefit to local radio and local newspapers, which are struggling in the current environment, particularly when advertising revenues have fallen off and moved largely online. As part of the wider reform of the TV licence fee, I think it is fair to say that any reform that is going to be meaningful, must be one that takes account of the fact that public service broadcasting is not just provided by RTÉ, although I think RTÉ does this very well, by the way, notwithstanding some of the issues it has had in recent months. What must also be taken into account is the fact that public service broadcasting is provided not just by RTÉ but also by local radio, local newspapers and the national independent media.	spk_31
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-05	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I thank the Deputy. It is important to put on the record of the House that the nitrates directive and derogation are environmental law and is about water quality above all. No matter what they do in America, India or China, and no matter what the Eamon Ryan thinks or does not think, all of us in the House want to have high quality waterways and rivers in our country.	spk_33
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-05	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	It is in the interests of urban and rural people, and farmers and non-farmers to have pristine and clean rivers and clean water in our country. Ultimately, that is what the nitrates directive and derogation is about. It is not about CO2 emissions or climate; it is about water quality. I am disappointed that we were not able to hold onto the 250 kg limit. We did our best to do so.	spk_35
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-05	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and I met the Commissioner and explored any possible flexibilities that we could get, including moving the date for implementation, but the rules are clear and are written in black and white in European law. We have some flexibilities. The average is not immediate from 1 January, but is over the period of the year so people can delay implementation. Obviously, that means doing more in the latter half of the year and the consequences that arise from that. It does not have to happen on 1 January; it is an average over a full year. There is the possibility of exporting slurry. There are other options available to farmers. As well as that, there are some changes to how calves are calculated in the directive and help for farmers was announced in the budget in terms of slurry storage and so on. My biggest concern for Irish farmers and our food industry is the possibility that we will lose the derogation altogether in 2025. The Netherlands has already lost it. It is already gone in Flanders. Only Ireland and Denmark continue to have the derogation. I have a big concern that we will lose it altogether. If we lose it, we will be doing a big disservice to Irish farmers, farm incomes and our wider food industry. The worst thing we can do for farmers is to tell them that this problem is going to go away because it is not. We have to work together to improve our water quality. That means changes being made on farms. It also means improving Uisce Éireann's infrastructure and doing lots of other things. The last thing we can do now is to turn a blind eye or tell people this problem is going to go away. It is not. The way we keep the derogation we have is to improve our water quality and that means the Government and farmers working together to make sure that happens.	spk_37
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-05	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I do not like anyone being demonised when it comes to this debate.

This is a European law-----	spk_43
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-05	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	-----agreed by 27 member states, and it has been around for quite some time, long before Eamon Ryan was a member of this Government. I believe it is possible to produce high-quality food in this country and still have good water quality. That is actually what people in Ireland want, in rural and in urban communities. If we get a reputation for producing food in a way that is not sustainable, we will lose market share around the world. A total of 90% of the food we produce is for export, and we need to maintain that reputation for having sustainable agriculture and being genuine about the Origin Green concept, so it is in everyone's interest to get this right. Farmers want to keep the derogation, we want to keep our market share around the world and we also want to improve our water quality, which means the Government and farmers working together to make sure that happens between now and 2025. Yes, it involves investment in treatment plants, reducing industrial waste and changes on farm. If we do that, we will keep the derogation, but bear this in mind. To keep the derogation is a vote of 27 member states, most of which do not have the derogation and see it as a competitive advantage that we have, so we need to be clever about this. It does not involve slagging off Eamon Ryan. It means boxing clever and actually looking after the interests of farmers, and that means improving our water quality so that we can keep the derogation.	spk_46
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-05	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	I appreciate the Deputies have raised some very important issues, which merit debate in the House. I point out, however, that there is dedicated Opposition time every week in the House and Opposition parties choose what they want to prioritise for discussion every week. The Government will use Government time for legislation. We have a lot of legislation to get through before the Christmas recess. The Opposition is free to use its time as it sees fit. On the three important points that were raised, I will have to ask the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to come back to Deputy McNamara on the explanatory memorandum. An explanatory memorandum of 120 pages is pretty big. I am not sure I have ever seen one that big.	spk_59
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-05	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	"I will ask the Minister to come back to the Deputy directly on that and to make sure that it is as good as it possibly can be. In relation to what we saw on ""Prime Time Investigates"" last night, let me be very clear: people seeking money to withdraw planning objections is not acceptable at all. The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice are examining the matter. Section 17 of the Criminal Justice Act states: ""It shall be an offence for any person who, with a view to gain for himself or another or with intent to cause loss to another, makes any unwarranted demand with menaces."" We also believe that sections 6 and 7 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act may apply as well. It probably is the case that this is already illegal. Of course, evidence and proving things are a much harder thing. Perhaps it needs a specific provision in the Planning and Development Act. I know the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is willing to examine that and to work with the Opposition on it. The Land Development Agency, LDA, is ramping up the construction of new homes, in particular, affordable housing. The LDA currently has access to €1.25 billion of capital from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, of which it has drawn down €625 million. It expects to draw down the remaining €600 million by the end of the year. It also has the ability to borrow up to €1.25 billion. For the LDA to carry out what it wants to do next year, and what we want it to do next year, it will require additional finance. It will not need €6 billion or €3 billion, though, for next year. What we are working out now is how much the LDA needs and when, in particular for next year."	spk_62
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-05	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	I do not think it is common practice to put Supplementary Estimates into the base. It may have happened once or twice in the past, but it would not be standard budgetary practice to do that.

I think the place to resolve this is in the service plan.	spk_66
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-05	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	I appreciate the Deputy's passion on this issue and I know she feels strongly about it. If she thinks there is something the Irish Government can do to force the Israeli Government and Hamas, Islamic Jihad and all those groups to agree a permanent ceasefire, that simply is not the case. We do what we can. That means assisting our citizens in Gaza to get out, and most of them are out now. It means working to secure humanitarian aid to make sure that can get into Gaza to relieve the suffering of the Palestinian people. It means using our voice as strongly as we can at EU and UN level to achieve what is achievable. If the Deputy is asking me is there something that the Government can do to make Benjamin Netanyahu change his policy in relation to Gaza, there is not. I think the Deputy knows that. If she does not know that, I am a bit worried.	spk_69
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-05	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	It is something we gave careful consideration to. The first thing we are proposing is to delete the archaic sexist language in the Constitution with regard to a women's duties in the home and to replace it with a new article which gives constitutional protection and recognition to care within the family. It does not necessarily have to be within the home but it does have to be family care. We took the view that family care is different. It is different to care provided in nursing homes or by commercial home care providers, for example. We took the view in the round that while it made sense to give constitutional protection and status within the family, extending that protection to commercial operations in the main, such as nursing homes and home care providers, would not have been the right thing to do.	spk_72
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-05	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	I had a very good meeting with the acting chairperson and the chief planner of An Bord Pleanála only last week or the week before. They have a full complement now of 15 board members. Their staff now is well above 300.They are starting to get on top of the backlog, which is encouraging. On the Deputy's question, we believe that requesting go-away money in order to withdraw a planning objection - I have a heard a less polite term for it, which I am sure the Deputy has heard too - but we will stick with that one for now - is already an offence under the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001. However, we are open to considering a specific amendment to the Planning and Development Bill that would make this a specific offence. The difficulty will always be getting sufficient evidence to carry out a prosecution.	spk_74
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-05	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	I have looked into that. The advice is as follows. Ireland is party to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, as are Israel and Palestine. All contracting parties to the convention undertake to prevent and punish genocide. If a party to the convention considers that another party is failing to meet its obligations, the injured party should initiate a dispute resolution process against that other party.

#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-05	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	Energy independence and all of the benefits that arise from that are our moonshot for the 21st century. That involves offshore wind, onshore wind, solar energy, interconnection, battery storage and all of those things put together. It makes sense to do this in a plan-led way, doing what is cheapest and quickest first and then doing what is most expensive and hardest to do thereafter. That is the general approach we are taking as a Government. People often ask why we have not done more offshore wind generation to date and it is because we have done so much onshore wind generation. About 40% of our electricity comes from onshore wind but the next big step is offshore. The Deputy asks a technical question, which is a valid one. The Minister, Deputy Ryan, has a paper on that which I have seen but I do not want to give the Deputy an answer that might be inaccurate. However, we will come to the Deputy with some more detail.	spk_83

From talking to other Heads of Government all around the world, I hear that everyone is doing this. Everyone is doing solar energy and everyone is installing wind turbines, onshore and offshore. It makes sense to do this in a plan-led manner, not a developer-led manner because that would just make it more expensive.

#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-05	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	Medical cards in Ireland are means-tested, so it is in almost all cases based on income. Medical cards are given to people who have a terminal illness. There are about 180,000 discretionary medical cards for other reasons. We did much work on this when I was Minister for Health. It is a detailed report and it is worth reading. It is over 100 pages along and was done by all the medical and other experts. They came to the conclusion that it would not be right to automatically give discretionary medical cards for some illnesses and not others, because who is to say that one illness should qualify and the other should not? Even within an illness, there are different types of illness and different levels of severity. There is the whole issue of comorbidities, where a person might have two or three illnesses. They came to the conclusion that listing some conditions that would automatically qualify for discretionary medical cards and others that would not, of the 1,000 or so conditions that exist, would not be the right approach. Like I say, I think the HSE is as sympathetic as it can be when it comes to cases such as this. As the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, pointed out, over 180,000 discretionary medical cards are currently active in the State.	spk_95
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-05	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputies for the various issues they raised. Deputy Moynihan mentioned the ongoing issue of boil water notices in Cork North-West. I agree that is not satisfactory. I will alert the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, to the issue once again and ask him to engage with Irish Water on it. On Deputy O'Reilly's question about X, formerly known as Twitter, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, has sought a meeting with that platform and wants to discuss with it what was said to her by the gardaí. I do not know if it has agreed to that meeting or not. I think Deputy O'Reilly and I would be united in calling for it to agree to meet the Minister in order that she can set out to it what was said to her by the gardaí. I was present at that meeting, by the way, so I know what the Minister, Deputy McEntee, was referring to. I would say to anyone that most of us are active on social media. Every major platform has community standards. We all know which platforms are good at implementing and respecting their own community standards and which are not. I will let people draw their own conclusions in that regard. Deputy Nolan asked about the N52 between Kilbeggan and Tullamore. We have a €1 billion road budget every year. It is never possible to fund every project every year. It never was. That particular project will, of course, be considered in the context of the roads programme for 2024.I assure Deputy Tóibín that the Government is not trying to go to battle with anyone. We are just trying to build a North-South interconnector, which is important for energy security, the environment, North-South co-operation and the all-Ireland electricity market. I cannot answer any questions about purchases EirGrid has or has not made but I will pass the question on to it for reply.In reply to Deputy Shanahan, the IMF has a managing director, Kristalina Georgieva. There is no vacancy. She has yet to decide whether she will seek a second term but if she does, she will have a lot of support for that.  On Deputy Healy-Rae's question on the EU nature restoration law, we believe that can be done entirely on State-owned land. It will be up to each member state to do their own national plan, which we will do. It can be done on state-owned land so any use of private land would not be imposed on the private landowner. They would have to agree to it, be compensated, or paid to make any changes. 	spk_102

The Government is making good progress in implementing the programme for Government. We led Ireland through the pandemic, saving lives and livelihoods. Over 500,000 more people are at work today than on the day the Government took office, and we are now at full employment. We are implementing far-reaching reforms like sick pay, the living wage, and auto-enrolment so that every worker has a pension, and we are setting asie surplus revenues for future investment. This is very much in line with the programme for Government objective that demands our economy recovers in a way that is fair and balanced, leaves no one behind, and is future-proofed against shocks.  Individual commitments in the programme for Government are advanced through the co-ordinating mechanisms of the Cabinet committee structure. The ten Cabinet committees established by the Government reflect the core policy areas that are set out in the programme. The strategy statements of all Departments reflect the national priorities outlined in the programme for Government. The Department of the Taoiseach is continuing to help advance the programme's commitments in the following significant policy areas: the first involves the implementation of the Housing for All strategy, including additional initiatives as necessary, to advance crucial housing related commitments; second is the continued engagement at EU and international level on the situation in the Middle East, including by calling for full observance of international law by all parties working to build consensus at EU level to take a more proactive approach in assisting a negotiated two-state solution and lasting peace process, and increased funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees or UNRWA; third is the engagement with EU leaders to advance high-level objectives in the programme for Government, in particular, economic and competitiveness issues, energy security, external relations including with the UK, as well as continuing our strong collective EU response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine; fourth is the pursuit of our international commitments, including strengthening our relationship with the US, and implementing the UN sustainable development goals; fifth is the advancement of the Government’s commitments on a shared island; sixth is ensuring the implementation of the New Decade, New Approach deal commitments, working with the relevant Departments, North and South, in advancing these goals, strengthening British-Irish relations, including with London, and the devolved governments in Wales and Scotland. It also includes the implementation of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, and the Government’s climate action plan; advancements in Sláintecare, improving access, outcomes and affordability for patients by increasing the capacity and effectiveness of the workforce, infrastructure and provision of patient care; oversight of the implementation of the third domestic, sexual and gender-based violence strategy; oversight of the implementation of A Policing Service for our Future, the Government’s plan to implement the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland through the policing reform implementation programme office of the Department; and the development of the well-being framework for Ireland and its integration into the policymaking and budgetary systems. It also involves the publication of Harnessing Digital - The Digital Ireland Framework in February 2022, and ongoing implementation to drive and enable the digital transition across the economy and society, with a first progress report in December 2022; progressing four citizens’ assemblies on a Dublin directly elected mayor and local government structures, biodiversity loss, drugs use, and the future of education; and finally, the establishment of the child poverty and well-being programme office in the Department of the Taoiseach to honour commitments identified in the programme for Government that will have the greatest impact on the lives of children who experience poverty and disadvantage.	spk_104
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-05	dail	33	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_8	I thank the Deputies for their questions. Deputy Dillon raised the important issue of mental health and deficits in CAMHS. We have real difficulties there, as Deputies will know, in securing skilled and qualified staff for those teams, but I assure the Deputy and the House that the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is committed to making all the reforms necessary and possible to improve the situation. Deputy Barry raised the issue of redundancies at Broadcom. I am not up to date on the particular issues there but I will speak to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, about it. I know he will want to take a particular interest in it, it being in Ballincollig, not too far from him. Deputy Tóibín asked about animal welfare. I will have to come back to the Deputy with an update on the timeline for the Government's legislative plans on that. Deputy O'Sullivan once again raised the issue of rare diseases and mentioned that 80 new medicines have been approved. We are examining the matter of setting aside some dedicated funding for new medicines next year. That will have to be dealt with in the context of the service plan. The same would apply to medical genetics. We are keen to make sure that the progress that has been made in recent years does not stall in 2024. Deputy Smith asked about help for SMEs that are facing increased energy and labour costs. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, received approval at Cabinet today for his €250 million scheme to help businesses with rising costs. Roughly 90% of businesses in Ireland will receive a grant to help with rising costs. We appreciate that the cost of energy is very high for business, as is the cost of labour. One thing of particular interest in the Border region was a decision of the UK Government in many ways to follow our lead in announcing a big increase in the national minimum wage. Actually, on current exchange rates, the national minimum wage north of the Border will be slightly higher than it is south of the Border in 2024, although that will depend on how exchange rates fluctuate over the period ahead. Of course, north of the Border, auto-enrolment already exists, as does sick pay, albeit at a lower rate. We always keep an eye on that because we do not want to disadvantage businesses south of the Border. The fact that those changes have been announced by the British Government helps to prove that we were right to make the changes we have made to improve pay and terms and conditions. On access to credit, I understand the point Deputy Smith makes about the loss of Ulster Bank, which is a real loss in terms of access to credit. How can we help?We have a lot of State-backed lending now, through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, Microfinance Ireland which is being moved properly into the Government sector, and particularly by encouraging more and more credit unions to offer business loans. The Minister of State, Deputy Carroll MacNeill, is very much leading the charge on this. Deputy Troy asked about ending direct provision. To say very clearly, that remains our policy as a Government but, of course, it is not currently achievable given the large numbers of people who have come to the country in the past two years. There are more than 100,000 from Ukraine and elsewhere, 70,000 of whom need accommodation from the State. Yes it is our plan to align the supports we offer to people coming here from Ukraine and people seeking international protection with other western European states. We will not turn anyone away, and nor can we either under international law or the basic practicalities of doing so, but we want to avoid what are called secondary movements of people who have sought international protection in another European country or stayed in another European country for some time before moving to Ireland to seek international protection here. With regard to the optional protocol in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was mentioned by Deputies Moynihan and Boyd Barrett, it is the position of the State that with regard to honouring international agreements we do not enter into binding international treaties until we are confident that obligations set out in them can be complied with. As such, a robust scoping exercise is procedurally necessary. This is currently being undertaken in conjunction with legal counsel by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. Until ratification, we will continue to fully implement the convention and we look forward to engaging with the UN committee when a review of Ireland's first state report is scheduled. That should be quite soon. Deputy McDonald asked about our renewable electricity target, which is 80% for 2030. I believe we will meet that. If we do not, we will not be far off it. With regard to the reforms we are making to make it possible, we have had a number of successful auctions and there are more to come. MARA has been set up for marine consent and it is up and running. The new planning and environment division of the High Court will sit for the first time next week. This will mean that judicial reviews will be heard and ruled on more quickly. An Bord Pleanála is being staffed up. The 15 board member complement is now there and there are additional staff. We have the planning and development Bill that will set statutory timelines for decisions to be made. I appeal to Sinn Féin to support this and not to oppose it. It cannot say that it is in favour of more home building and in favour of climate action if it votes against the Bill because it is the Bill that will help us to make these decisions happen more quickly.	spk_118

Waiting lists are down 20% from their post-pandemic peak. Health outcomes are improving and life expectancy in Ireland has never been longer. This is money that is being well spent. There are also 20,000 additional staff and 1,000 extra beds since the Government came to office with more to come. If there is a deficit next year, and it is not unusual for there to be a deficit in the HSE budget, we will deal with it by means of a supplementary. To respond to Deputy Ó Murchú, the terms of reference for the Covid inquiry have to go to the Government. We hope this will happen soon. We are keen to engage with the Opposition on it.

#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-05	dail	33	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_8	I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 to 20, inclusive, together. I met with a group of resident Arab ambassadors and representatives of countries from the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in Government Buildings on Tuesday, 21 November to discuss the situation in the Middle East, and in particular the ongoing conflict between Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups and Israel, and the terrible impact this conflict is having on the people of Gaza. The meeting provided me with an opportunity to hear their views on the dire and deteriorating humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip and the rising violence and deaths in the West Bank. I emphasised Ireland’s clear position that international humanitarian law applies in all conflicts, in all circumstances, to state and non-state actors alike. We discussed the urgent need for a humanitarian ceasefire and the need to de-escalate the crisis. I assured the group of Ireland’s commitment to do all we can, working within the EU and with our international partners, to bring about an end to the conflict, to provide critical aid to the people of Gaza and to turn our efforts to securing a sustainable peace based on the two-State solution. I thanked the ambassadors for their countries' support in helping Irish citizens and their dependents to leave Gaza. I also raised the case of Emily Hand and asked the group to use any influence their countries may have in securing the unconditional release of all hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. I think that the House will join me in welcoming the release by Hamas of Emily, who is now reunited with her family, and I am pleased that the Government could play its part in working for her release with our partners in the region. My attendance at COP 28 in Dubai last week also gave me a further opportunity to speak with leaders from the region about the evolving situation. Among those I met were the Emir of Qatar, the King of Jordan, the President of Egypt, the President of the United Arab Emirates, the Prime Minister of Lebanon and the Prime Minister of Iraq, who, in addition to offering their analysis, thanked the Irish Government for its strong position on the crisis.  We shared serious considerations about the dire and worsening humanitarian situation and our disappointment and dismay about the resumption of hostilities. We agreed that efforts must continue on seeking the establishment of a durable humanitarian ceasefire and towards reviving a political process based on a two-state solution. I also thanked the leaders for their assistance in facilitating Irish citizens to leave Gaza as well as for their help with securing the release of Emily Hand and other hostages. I asked them to use any influence they have to secure the release of all hostages still being held in Gaza, in particular women and children.	spk_122
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-05	dail	33	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_8	I hear a recurring theme from Deputies opposite. I think half of them are half-saying it and the other half are saying they are not saying it. It is that they seem to think that there is some sort of action the Government could take this evening or tomorrow that would cause the Prime Minister of Israel to think again and change his policy. Half the Opposition Deputies seem to be half-saying this half the time but then when I ask them if that is what they are saying, they say they are not saying it. I heard a very good analysis not that long ago from an expert on the history and politics of the region which made it very clear that not even at this stage will the views of the United States cause a change in policy in Israel. There would have been a time when Israel would have been very sensitive to what the US had to say in this regard.	spk_133

When I meet with Arab ambassadors, presidents and prime ministers, they recognise Ireland as one of the countries that is taking a principled stance on this issue. Then, when I come into this Chamber, I get shouted at from the far left as if I am somehow a representative of Israel. It is just so divorced from the reality of what we hear from people who are dealing with this in their own lives every day in the Arab world. It is, quite frankly, objectionable in my view.	spk_145

#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-05	dail	33	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_8	On the question from Deputy Haughey, as to whether there is a collective view from the Arab countries that I engage with, I do not think it would be correct to say there is a collective view. There are different emphases from Egypt to Jordan to Qatar, for example. I think there is a majority view that there should be a permanent ceasefire; that there should be no expulsions of Palestinians from Gaza or the West Bank into Egypt and Jordan and they would not facilitate that; that there should not be a second Nakba, and we strongly agree with their position on that; that there should not be a future for Hamas in having any control of Gaza; that there should be no reoccupation of Gaza or territorial diminution of Gaza; and that Gaza would have to be handed back to some form of Palestinian control or a Palestinian authority when this current terrible phase of the conflict ends. I have to say Ireland would broadly be of the same view as those Arab countries and we offered to support those countries in any practical way we could. That is exactly what we are doing. What we are not going to get involved in are gesture politics, doing things that are ineffectual and that do not actually help the Palestinians, but just make us feel or look good. That is not a serious approach and does not merit anything, in my view. Deputy Ó Murchú asked about what we are doing on a European level. There is no consensus at European level on this matter. We have been able to agree certain resolutions and certain language but the language is not precise enough, in my view. We do not have QMV votes on foreign policy, so this must be done on a unanimous basis, which makes it very hard - next to impossible - to have a common European position on this matter. We are one of about eight countries that are most sympathetic to the Palestinian people's rightful demand for justice and human rights and statehood, and we are co-ordinating with those countries as to what we can do that would actually be effective and can actually make a difference. On the issue of the genocide convention, I sought advice on it. The advice I have is that it is the injured party that should initiate proceedings under the genocide convention. That makes a lot of sense to me. The Members opposite might not like that-----	spk_159

#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-05	dail	33	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_8	It is the case that the Palestinian Authority has not decided to take, or at least my advice is that it has not taken, a case as an injured party.	spk_163
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-05	dail	33	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_8	If I am incorrect on that, I am happy to clarify. Again, there are interruptions when uncomfortable facts are put across.	spk_165
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-05	dail	33	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_8	Just on genocide, I think, or at least I hope, we all agree in this House that the Holocaust, the Shoah, was a genocide.	spk_167
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-05	dail	33	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_8	Hitler killed 6 million people and he would have killed another 3 million to 6 million people if he could have. Deputy Boyd Barrett takes the view that the killing of 15,000 people in Gaza is a genocide, and it would appear that they intend to kill many more. I will ask this question, however, and I think it is a reasonable one to ask. Is what Hamas has done to Israel not also genocidal?	spk_169
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-05	dail	33	Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements	dbsect_8	Hamas went into Israel, killed 1,400 people, including women and children, and took people hostage.They would have killed many more if they had the chance. I have no doubt that Hamas would kill as many people in Israel as it possibly could if it was given the chance and had the weapons. Why is that not a genocide? Is 1,400 people not enough? 	spk_171
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-05	dail	33	Programme for Government	dbsect_9	Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna Uimh 1 go 14, le chéile. The Government is making good progress in implementing the programme for Government. We led Ireland through the pandemic, saving lives and livelihoods. Over 500,000 more people are at work today than on the day the Government took office, and we are now at full employment. We are implementing far-reaching reforms like sick pay, the living wage, and auto-enrolment so that every worker has a pension, and we are setting asie surplus revenues for future investment. This is very much in line with the programme for Government objective that demands our economy recovers in a way that is fair and balanced, leaves no one behind, and is future-proofed against shocks.  Individual commitments in the programme for Government are advanced through the co-ordinating mechanisms of the Cabinet committee structure. The ten Cabinet committees established by the Government reflect the core policy areas that are set out in the programme. The strategy statements of all Departments reflect the national priorities outlined in the programme for Government. The Department of the Taoiseach is continuing to help advance the programme's commitments in the following significant policy areas: the first involves the implementation of the Housing for All strategy, including additional initiatives as necessary, to advance crucial housing related commitments; second is the continued engagement at EU and international level on the situation in the Middle East, including by calling for full observance of international law by all parties working to build consensus at EU level to take a more proactive approach in assisting a negotiated two-state solution and lasting peace process, and increased funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees or UNRWA; third is the engagement with EU leaders to advance high-level objectives in the programme for Government, in particular, economic and competitiveness issues, energy security, external relations including with the UK, as well as continuing our strong collective EU response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine; fourth is the pursuit of our international commitments, including strengthening our relationship with the US, and implementing the UN sustainable development goals; fifth is the advancement of the Government’s commitments on a shared island; sixth is ensuring the implementation of the New Decade, New Approach deal commitments, working with the relevant Departments, North and South, in advancing these goals, strengthening British-Irish relations, including with London, and the devolved governments in Wales and Scotland. It also includes the implementation of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, and the Government’s climate action plan; advancements in Sláintecare, improving access, outcomes and affordability for patients by increasing the capacity and effectiveness of the workforce, infrastructure and provision of patient care; oversight of the implementation of the third domestic, sexual and gender-based violence strategy; oversight of the implementation of A Policing Service for our Future, the Government’s plan to implement the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland through the policing reform implementation programme office of the Department; and the development of the well-being framework for Ireland and its integration into the policymaking and budgetary systems. It also involves the publication of Harnessing Digital - The Digital Ireland Framework in February 2022, and ongoing implementation to drive and enable the digital transition across the economy and society, with a first progress report in December 2022; progressing four citizens’ assemblies on a Dublin directly elected mayor and local government structures, biodiversity loss, drugs use, and the future of education; and finally, the establishment of the child poverty and well-being programme office in the Department of the Taoiseach to honour commitments identified in the programme for Government that will have the greatest impact on the lives of children who experience poverty and disadvantage.	spk_104
#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-05	dail	33	Programme for Government	dbsect_9	I thank the Deputies for their questions. Deputy Dillon raised the important issue of mental health and deficits in CAMHS. We have real difficulties there, as Deputies will know, in securing skilled and qualified staff for those teams, but I assure the Deputy and the House that the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is committed to making all the reforms necessary and possible to improve the situation. Deputy Barry raised the issue of redundancies at Broadcom. I am not up to date on the particular issues there but I will speak to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, about it. I know he will want to take a particular interest in it, it being in Ballincollig, not too far from him. Deputy Tóibín asked about animal welfare. I will have to come back to the Deputy with an update on the timeline for the Government's legislative plans on that. Deputy O'Sullivan once again raised the issue of rare diseases and mentioned that 80 new medicines have been approved. We are examining the matter of setting aside some dedicated funding for new medicines next year. That will have to be dealt with in the context of the service plan. The same would apply to medical genetics. We are keen to make sure that the progress that has been made in recent years does not stall in 2024. Deputy Smith asked about help for SMEs that are facing increased energy and labour costs. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, received approval at Cabinet today for his €250 million scheme to help businesses with rising costs. Roughly 90% of businesses in Ireland will receive a grant to help with rising costs. We appreciate that the cost of energy is very high for business, as is the cost of labour. One thing of particular interest in the Border region was a decision of the UK Government in many ways to follow our lead in announcing a big increase in the national minimum wage. Actually, on current exchange rates, the national minimum wage north of the Border will be slightly higher than it is south of the Border in 2024, although that will depend on how exchange rates fluctuate over the period ahead. Of course, north of the Border, auto-enrolment already exists, as does sick pay, albeit at a lower rate. We always keep an eye on that because we do not want to disadvantage businesses south of the Border. The fact that those changes have been announced by the British Government helps to prove that we were right to make the changes we have made to improve pay and terms and conditions. On access to credit, I understand the point Deputy Smith makes about the loss of Ulster Bank, which is a real loss in terms of access to credit. How can we help?We have a lot of State-backed lending now, through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, Microfinance Ireland which is being moved properly into the Government sector, and particularly by encouraging more and more credit unions to offer business loans. The Minister of State, Deputy Carroll MacNeill, is very much leading the charge on this. Deputy Troy asked about ending direct provision. To say very clearly, that remains our policy as a Government but, of course, it is not currently achievable given the large numbers of people who have come to the country in the past two years. There are more than 100,000 from Ukraine and elsewhere, 70,000 of whom need accommodation from the State. Yes it is our plan to align the supports we offer to people coming here from Ukraine and people seeking international protection with other western European states. We will not turn anyone away, and nor can we either under international law or the basic practicalities of doing so, but we want to avoid what are called secondary movements of people who have sought international protection in another European country or stayed in another European country for some time before moving to Ireland to seek international protection here.

#LeoVaradkar	2023-12-05	dail	33	Confidence in the Minister for Justice: Motion	dbsect_11	I move:That Dáil Éireann has confidence in the Minister for Justice, Helen McEntee TD.We will debate a lot of things over the next two hours, but I want to reiterate that our thoughts are first and foremost with the schoolchildren and their carer who were so brutally and senselessly attacked last Thursday week. Two remain in hospital this evening and we hope they make a recovery. I also want to restate my gratitude to those who risked their lives to save other lives and to thank the gardaí and front-line, council, transport and retail workers, of all nationalities, for their response to the riots that ensued. Their response demonstrates the power of people working together and I believe they, and the public at large, want us in this House to work together to make our capital’s streets safer. The issue of confidence is a distraction from that important work. I have known the Minister, Deputy Helen McEntee, for nearly 20 years. I worked on her by-election campaign after the sad death of her father Shane and I had the privilege of appointing her as Minister with responsibility for European affairs in 2017, when I first became Taoiseach, to work alongside the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and me on the important issue of Brexit. Helen is trustworthy, sincere, intelligent and loyal. She is someone I turn to in difficult times and is never afraid to show her mettle when challenged, as she has in the past week or two. I am thankful for her work as Minister for Justice, carrying on my party’s tradition of law and order, alongside a wide agenda of reform, as well as cracking down on crime, helping victims and improving access to justice. Her record speaks for itself. Recruitment to An Garda Síochána is recovering post pandemic, with up to 800 new recruits entering Templemore this year alone. She has negotiated the highest ever budget for the Garda, over 20% higher than when she started in office in 2020. We now have the largest fleet of vehicles in the organisation’s history, with around 100 extra Garda cars and vans due by the end of this year. Gardaí will soon have body-worn cameras for the first time, with the first phase due to start in Dublin early next year. This will improve their safety, as well as evidence gathering.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, is introducing facial recognition technology to enable retrospective viewing of CCTV footage, freeing up thousands of hours of Garda time. She has already doubled the maximum sentence for assault causing harm, increased the sentence for conspiracy to murder from ten years to life and increased the sentence for assaulting a Garda or emergency worker from seven to 12 years. She is also working to crack down on the proceeds of organised crime. The number of gang-related murders has fallen significantly on her watch. She is working on the overhaul of archaic licensing and night-time entertainment laws, reforming our defamation laws, modernising our outdated incitement to hatred and hate crime laws and creating a new dedicated family court. No Minister has done more than she has to combat violence against women. She has also appointed more judges and has plans to expand prison capacity. I know we need to ensure people are safe and feel safe in Dublin city centre. I have committed, as Taoiseach, that the full resources of the State will be available to the Minister and Garda Commissioner, and I will make sure that there is leadership and co-ordination from my office in that regard. We need a tough response to the riots. That is clear. We also need to understand why some people reacted in the way they did and to what extent the riots were orchestrated by subversive elements. These riots do not reflect the wishes of the vast majority of people in Dublin’s north inner city. I know that. Of the 48 people arrested, only four were resident in Dublin 1. In politics we will always have disagreements, but there also needs to be a sense of proportion and balance and unity in times of real crisis. The Sinn Féin motion of no confidence was a political stunt, unnecessary and counter-productive. People want us to work together to improve law and order, not just in Dublin but across the country. Removing the justice Minister and the Garda Commissioner, which is Sinn Féin policy, would be a victory for those who engaged in and incited violence on our streets. It would embolden them to strike again. That alone should be sufficient reason to vote with the Government tonight. I would not have confidence in a Sinn Féin member becoming Minister for Justice. I would not have confidence in a Sinn Féin member, as Minister for Justice, proposing the appointment of the next Garda Commissioner. Sinn Féin has talked a lot about horrific events unfolding in the Middle East, and rightly so, but it will not acknowledge war crimes that may have happened in this country, crimes committed in our name by terrorists the Irish people always rejected, crimes like the Enniskillen and Warrington bombings, in which children were killed. Their justification is reminiscent: it was not deliberate; they were not being targeted; they were just collateral damage. Nor will it acknowledge crimes like the murders of Garda Jerry McCabe, Patrick Kelly and Brian Stack. Of course, Sinn Féin politicians, when asked, and they are not asked often, will use every word imaginable to avoid admitting that these were crimes and that the perpetrators were criminals who should be dishonoured, brought to justice and punished. That is why we cannot have a Sinn Féin Taoiseach, a Sinn Féin justice Minister and a Sinn Féin defence Minister, in the next Government or any Government. The events of 23 November were a real shock and were not something we are used to in Ireland, thankfully. We need to make sure these were exceptional events and I vow that we will. For those who are listening at home, I encourage you to come to Dublin city over the festive period to support our businesses and show solidarity with city centre communities. There is an increased Garda presence and it is highly visible. We will be doing everything we can to make sure you are safe, feel safe at all times and get home safely. Mar a dúirt mé an tseachtain seo caite, mar Rialtas, beimid gan staonadh ó thaobh ár saoránaigh agus daoine a chosaint. Beidh gardaí ar na sráideanna agus déanfaidh siad aon rud atá ag teastáil ionas go mothóidh daoine sábháilte. As I said last week, as a Government we will be relentless in protecting our citizens and defending our people and their property. Gardaí will be on the streets and visible and will do whatever it takes to make sure people are safe and feel safe. A Cheann Comhairle, it is an honour for me to express my full confidence in my friend and colleague Deputy Helen McEntee. I commend this motion to the House.	spk_185

#LeoVaradkar	2023-11-28	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	Last Thursday, we experienced two appalling acts of violence on our streets. First, the stabbing of several children and their carer, two of whom remain in hospital as we speak. They are stable, but critical and we pray for their recovery. Second, an ugly far-right protest on our streets led to a riot, looting and serious criminal damage. These events were shocking and unacceptable. It was an attack on the rule of law and there is and will be a robust response from An Garda Síochána and the Government. We need to make sure that Thursday's events were exceptional and do not happen again. I want people to be and feel safe on our streets. As part of that, the Commissioner has confirmed that two Garda public order units will be deployed in Dublin city centre between now and at least Christmas. They are made up of two inspectors, six sergeants and 42 gardaí, so there will be a visible Garda presence on our streets in the coming weeks. Above all we need to do three things. We need more gardaí, better equipment for our gardaí and stronger laws and more prison places. All those things are already very much under way and were under way before the events of last Thursday, but they need to be accelerated. We now have 14,000 gardaí. About 700 to 800 will go through training this year and about 800 to 1,000 next year. We expect Garda numbers to rise to 14,500 by the end of next year. In addition, more than 3,000 civilian staff free up gardaí for front-line work. We have over 3,000 Garda vehicles - 150 more are on order - we have riot gear for 2,500 gardaí, water cannons are on loan and body cameras will soon be on the way. We also need to strengthen our laws. The Minister, Deputy McEntee, has already brought in tougher sentences for people who commit serious crimes and attack our gardaí. She has plans for an additional 600 prison spaces to make sure that those who are convicted and given long prison sentences serve them. We also need new laws around the use of facial recognition technology and object recognition technology and dedicated legislation on that is on the way. We will bring in a police powers Bill to give police some of the additional powers they asked for when I visited them in Store Street last week and before the recess the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill 2023 will be enacted. The response is immediate, medium term and long term and it is and will be robust. It is true, as the Deputy said, that other countries have issued warnings to tourists, including their citizens, who visit Dublin, but she should bear in mind that they issue the same warnings about many large cities around the world, including their own large cities and capital cities. It is important that when Deputy McDonald talks about our city, the one we both live, she puts it in that context. I know she does not want to talk down our city in any way. I have full confidence in An Garda Síochána, in Garda management, including the Commissioner Harris, and I have full confidence in the Minister, Deputy McEntee. As Minister, she has led and been extremely active on issues of law and order and criminal justice during her term in office. In particular, I draw the Deputy's attention to the success we have had in dealing with organised crime. In previous years, we saw dozens of murders every year. A lot of success and results in that area are down to her work and that of An Garda Síochána. In addition, she has led on the issue of gender-based violence. We are facing an epidemic of violence against women and no Minister has done more about it than her. Look at what is being done in Drogheda, for example, as Deputy O'Dowd spoke about this morning. These are the results she has been involved in making happen and her work continues.	spk_3
#LeoVaradkar	2023-11-28	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I believe Deputy McDonald is not listening. She is not listening to parents. She is not listening to Dubliners.

#LeoVaradkar	2023-11-28	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	They are not interested in that. They do not want to see her trying to score points and improve her poll ratings or looking for heads. What they want is action from the Government so they feel safe on our streets. I want people to be safe and feel safe on our streets. That is why we are responding with more gardaí, better equipment for our gardaí and stronger laws. All of those things are happening under the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and we will continue and accelerate that action.	spk_7
#LeoVaradkar	2023-11-28	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I thank the Deputy for raising Gaelscoil Choláiste Mhuire, the childcare facility nearby which the children were being brought to and the people who intervened to help stop the attack on Thursday. Many more people would have been injured and perhaps killed had those brave people not gone with their instincts and intervened in the way they did. All of us send our solidarity to Gaelscoil Chólaiste Mhuire and the childcare facility concerned. I had the opportunity to ring the owner of the childcare facility and speak to the principal of the school a few days ago and to offer them any help the Government possibly can, not just now but in the weeks and months ahead. They have received support from the National Educational Psychological Service. The main advice they have been given is, as much as possible, though it almost sounds impossible, to make things as normal as possible for the children in the school and childcare facility in the coming days. That is the advice they have been given and it is important we respect and comply with that ourselves.  I had the opportunity on Sunday night to meet some of those who intervened in the attack. I was given five names by the Garda; four were able to attend, from Ireland, Brazil and France. I thanked them for what they did to stop the attack. Without it, there would have been more injuries and loss of life. On the management of protests, The Garda has policed 700 protests in the past year. Protests are commonplace in Ireland, as they are in any democracy. It is important we facilitate peaceful protests. The gardaí on the scene make a decision on an operational basis. None of us are experts in policing protests. Gardaí make a decision on the scene as to what approach is appropriate and escalate as they believe appropriate. Of course, there will be a review into what occurred on Thursday. An initial review is under way from the Garda Commissioner. The Policing Authority, I think, has the authority to carry out a further review, though we will have to check on that. I concur with the Deputy on some of the language some people have used in Leinster House and beyond it in relation to migration. It is a difficult topic to talk about as politicians but we have to talk about it. It would be a mistake not to. Some of what has been said has stirred up prejudices and there are people on the far right in politics who will want to stir up further discord and encourage further violence. We have incitement to hatred legislation. I do not think it is strong enough or up to date enough. I know this House agrees because it has voted for the new legislation already. It is now in the Seanad. Even under existing legislation, the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation has a number of investigations under way.	spk_12
#LeoVaradkar	2023-11-28	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	Deputy Bacik has suggested an independent review by the Garda Síochána Inspectorate. We will give consideration to that. It may well be a very good idea. I do not want to commit to it on the hoof on the floor of the House but I will certainly give it consideration. I thank the Deputy for her constructive remarks. She is absolutely right that accountability is required. Before we jump to any judgment on what happened on Thursday night and on whether there were errors on behalf of the gardaí, the Minister or the Commissioner, of course we would carry out a review first. That is proper accountability. What we see from the main Opposition party and from others, as Deputy Bacik points out, is grandstanding - judge, jury and executioner, and sure we will do the review afterwards. That is not how politics should be conducted and it is actually not what the people want.	spk_14
#LeoVaradkar	2023-11-28	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I thank the Deputy. More than ever, all of us in this House need to be willing to talk about migration and to do so in a fair way.I want to make the case for migration and why it is a good thing for Ireland. When I go into any hospital in Ireland, including ones in which I have worked, I see a very diverse workforce. Many of the doctors, nurses and other staff who looked after the stabbing victims come from other parts of the world. When I go into high-tech or pharmaceutical companies - the ones paying massive taxes to the State - I see a diverse workforce. I know those companies would not be in Ireland were it not for the fact that they can recruit staff from all over the world. We would not have the money we now have for health, education or housing were it not for the migrants who come to Ireland and work in those companies. When I go to a restaurant, café or shop, I see a diverse workforce as well. Ireland would not be the country it is, we would not have the public services we have and, in all ways imaginable, Ireland would not be a better place in any way I can think of were it not for the fact that so many people come here legally to take up work, study and visit. It is important that we all have the courage as politicians to make the case in favour of migration to the State. A lot of people, particularly people of colour in Ireland, are very afraid because of what happened on Thursday night. I have spoken to business owners who had to close their shops or offices early because staff, particularly staff who are brown or black, were afraid of what might happen to them. More than ever, we all need to understand - me, Deputy Lowry and everyone - the effects our words might have when talking about the issue of migration. That is not for a second to dismiss concerns people may have. If a large number of people move into a local area, town or village, of course people will have concerns which need to be addressed and answered. Of course there is a difference between people who come to the country legally and those who arrive irregularly. The amount of control we exert over that, as with any state, is limited. The United Kingdom, for example, has proposed a hostile environment for migration for many years. That is the term it uses; it is not my term. It left the European Union in part to take back control of borders. The front page of the 	spk_23
#LeoVaradkar	2023-11-28	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I appreciate Deputy Lowry's bona fides in this matter. It is important to say that people who come to Ireland to seek international protection are not necessarily here illegally. Under our laws, people can seek international protection in Ireland and their status only becomes illegal when their application has been refused and a deportation issued. It is important that people do not conflate those seeking international protection with people who are here illegally. It is not the same thing. On what the Deputy said about people's concerns, I understand and appreciate those concerns. I know them from my constituency and from around the country. When a large number of people from any background are accommodated in your parish, town or village, of course there will be concerns about the impact on education, law and order and health.Yes, we need to respond to that. We have established community engagement programmes to give people proper information about what is happening. We have the community-----	spk_28

There are a lot of challenges to doing that, but we know we have to act in those areas.	spk_30
#LeoVaradkar	2023-11-28	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	I thank Deputy Harkin. I am aware of the situation in Dromahair. I have only been briefed about it but only today and I do not want to comment on it in detail in case I do not have all the facts. I am told that a community engagement team has been set up, and it has been engaging with Deputies Feighan, Harkin and Kenny in an effort to set out exactly what is and is not happening in Dromahair. Deputy Harkin asked what our immigration and migration policy is. Let me be as clear as I can be, and sometimes it is difficult to be clear because this is not straightforward. There are different types of migration and different types of migrants. The situation is that anybody who is a UK or Irish citizen has a right to live in this country. Anybody who is an EU or EEA citizen has a right to live, work, study and do business in this country, just as we can in all of their countries too.That is what it means to be part of the European Union. I think the advantages of that outweigh the disadvantages manifold, and people have voted that way in referendums on many occasions. When it comes to anyone else, in order to enter the country, a person requires a visa. It might be a work visa, it might be a student visa or it might be a work permit. Of course vetting occurs in those instances. Separate to that, we have people who arrive from Ukraine under the temporary protection directive. They have a right to be here under European law. We do our best to accommodate them as best we can. They have the right to work and study. Then we have people who arrive in an irregular manner. Under international law, and just as is the case in Italy, Britain, France and America, they can apply for protection. Our job is to assess their applications as quickly as possible, give them legal status if they are entitled to it and, if they are not, to issue deportation orders and ensure those are enforced. This is our migration policy. I know it is not simple and I know it is not straightforward, but it cannot be, as life is not straightforward and the world is not straightforward. There are different people coming from different countries for different reasons. That is the policy that we have. Finally, regarding the terrible events that occurred on Parnell Square on Thursday, I really would ask people to try to avoid connecting crime with migration. It is not right.	spk_32
#LeoVaradkar	2023-11-28	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	Yes, of course people who are migrants might commit crimes, just as people who are not commit crimes. In a country of 5.3 million people, if there are hundreds of thousands of migrants, there are going to be a few of them who commit terrible crimes, just as there are people born and bred in Ireland who commit terrible crimes every day, including murder. When I look at what happened on Parnell Square, what I see is a suspect who is a migrant, although a citizen and someone who has been here for over 20 years. I see a five-year-old child in hospital today, both her parents coming from migrant backgrounds, with her born in Ireland. Of the five or six people who intervened to stop the attack, four of them were migrants to this country. It is totally wrong to try to make out that there is a connection between crime and migration based on what happened on Parnell Street.	spk_34
#LeoVaradkar	2023-11-28	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	Of the alleged assailant, the victims and those who stopped the attack, most are from migrant backgrounds.	spk_36
#LeoVaradkar	2023-11-28	dail	33	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	dbsect_2	Thanks very much, Deputy. When it comes to concerns about migration - I talk to a lot of people about this all the time – I do not think the vast majority of people gave huge concerns about people coming to Ireland from the UK or the European Union, or about people coming here with work visas or student visas from outside the European Union. There is a real concern around irregular migration – people arriving here seeking international protection. Precisely because it is so hard to manage, we do not know how many will arrive on any given day, where they will be from or what documents they will have. Contrary to what you will hear and to what is being spread about the place, the number of people seeking international protection in Ireland this year will be lower than last year. It will be roughly 13,000 this year, down from 15,000 the year before. That is in part because of actions we have taken as the EU to secure the external borders of the European Union and also in this State in terms of managing our own borders better.However, it is naive to think any Government can stop the flow entirely when there are hundreds of millions of people on the move in the world. Within weeks of a Government being elected in Italy very much the basis of on an anti-migration platform, more people landed on the island of Lampedusa than live there. We saw the attempts of former President Trump in the US. Huge numbers of people arrived throughout his presidency. We also know what is happening in the UK. We have to be honest with people about this. The world is a dangerous place. Europe is paradise, and Ireland is one of the best parts of paradise for most people in the world. Hundreds of millions of people are on the move. Thousands will come here and we just have to manage that as well as we can.	spk_38

Tomorrow, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, will take Taoiseach's questions and Questions on Promised Legislation in my stead for the best part of an hour, during which time she may be asked questions on any matter Members wish to ask about. I will be attending COP28 in Dubai so will not be able to attend in the House tomorrow. There are no plans for a guillotine on the Planning and Development Bill. Second Stage was delayed. We have no plans at present for a guillotine. A debate on migration is a matter for the Business Committee to schedule. I have no objection to it whatsoever, but I would suggest that we would need some ground rules and the professionalism of a very strong Chair for such a debate. I understand that a motion on neutrality is being taken this week.	spk_47
#LeoVaradkar	2023-11-28	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	We do not intend to do that. The number of people in emergency accommodation continued to rise when the ban was in place. All it does, unfortunately, is make the problem worse later. There is no one solution, but the main solution, we believe, is to continue to accelerate the construction of social housing and public housing. I believe this year will be a record year for the amount of social and public housing built, the highest, certainly, since the mid-seventies.	spk_49
#LeoVaradkar	2023-11-28	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputy. Just over 13,000 people are in receipt of emergency accommodation from the State at the moment. It is not the same 13,000 people all the time, as the Deputy knows. There are people coming into homelessness and others going out of homelessness. Our objective is to ensure homelessness is rare, that it is not repeated and that when it occurs, it is short lived. At the moment, people who experience homelessness spend roughly six to nine months in homelessness. That is a long time, particularly for a child, and the best thing we can do is to speed up the provision of social housing so we have options and can get people into secure tenancies as quickly as possible.	spk_51

When the Garda College was closed during the pandemic, we lost over a year of recruitment. We are bouncing back from that now.

Maybe there is a reason for it, I do not know, but I would be quite concerned about any cuts of that nature for community funding. The Minister of State, Deputy O’Brien, is responsible for that area and I will get my office to contact him today and ask him to speak to the Deputy directly.	spk_72
#LeoVaradkar	2023-11-28	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	It is important that all parts of the State and all counties are adequately policed. I agree on that. We are back up to about 14,000 Garda members at the moment. We expect 700 to 800 recruits through the Garda College this year, rising to 800 to 1,000 next year. That will allow total Garda numbers to increase to 14,500 by the end of next year. We are raising the minimum age at which you can join the Garda. We will also increase the retirement age to allow more experienced gardaí to stay on if they want to. We will make a formal decision on that in a matter of weeks. I have also asked the Minister, Deputy McEntee, to come up with any new proposals that we may be able to put in place quickly to increase numbers.	spk_76
#LeoVaradkar	2023-11-28	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	I thank the Deputy for raising the issue of diabetes. I am not sure if it has been raised with me in the House before. It is such a common illness that it is good to hear it being raised. It is extraordinarily common. Most people will have a family member who has diabetes. There are many different types, and people who have diabetes often have many other illnesses or co-morbidities. However, if it is managed well and looked after, people with diabetes can live long, healthy lives and avoid those co-morbidities, which is why it is so important it is treated well. I agree with the Deputy that we need better data. A national patient register would help in many ways, including allowing us to track patients so they do not get lost to follow-up and allowing us to carry out better research. I will definitely speak to the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, about it.	spk_78

#LeoVaradkar	2023-11-28	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	I will certainly make the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and Minister of State, Deputy O'Brien, aware of that request.	spk_84
#LeoVaradkar	2023-11-28	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	The Deputy is absolutely right. I would welcome such a debate. I agree it should be fair, balanced and measured. It is also important that it be informed. I am not an expert on immigration law, but I worry when I hear Members of this and the other House mixing up international protection with temporary protection or EEA with EU. We in this Chamber are well paid and we all have a duty to understand the facts and know the basics around migration. I certainly agree we should have a debate.	spk_86
#LeoVaradkar	2023-11-28	dail	33	An tOrd Gnó - Order of Business	dbsect_3	I would be happy to look into it. If the Deputy passes on the details to my office along with permission from the gentleman for me to make representations on his behalf, I will certainly do so. Our target is that no one who needs to see a specialist would have to wait more than ten or 12 weeks. Unfortunately, approximately 400,000 people are waiting longer than that at the moment. However, five years is extraordinarily long for any condition so I would be happy to look into that.	spk_88
#LeoVaradkar	2023-11-28	dail	33	An Garda Síochána	dbsect_10	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, together. The report, Breaking the Cycle: New Measures in Budget 2024 to Reduce Child Poverty and Promote Well-being, describes the enhanced steps the Government is taking to help children to realise their potential and escape intergenerational poverty. While the most substantial investment the Government makes in reducing child poverty is through existing programmes and expenditures, this report provides a whole-of-government overview of new and additional spending in budget 2024. Budget 2024 strongly reflects my focus on reducing child poverty and improving child well-being. It does so in a joined-up way which seeks to make progress on the six priorities identified in the child poverty and well-being programme plan, From Poverty to Potential: A Programme Plan for Child Poverty and Well-being 2023-2025. In developing their budget plans, every Minister and their Department considered their contribution to ending child poverty and promoting child well-being. This is the first time we sought to co-ordinate spending plans on child poverty and child well-being. According to the ESRI, measures taken in the budget will lead to reductions in child poverty through both the one-off cost-of-living package measures and permanent changes. Based on last year’s census, this means that approximately 22,000 fewer children will be at risk of poverty next year. While we have more to do, this progress represents significantly fewer children living with financial uncertainty next year. The once-off cost-of-living measures are temporary measures which will help people with recent price increases, and they alone will reduce the at-risk-of-poverty rate for children by 1.3%. Permanent measures include changes to social protection rates, such as increases in the qualified child allowance and changes to the threshold for the working family payment. These will reduce the at-risk-of-poverty rate for children by a further 0.5%. Taken together, the ESRI projects that budget 2024 will reduce the at-risk-of-poverty rate for children from 16.6% to 14.8%. ESRI and Department of Finance analysis also shows that the budget will have a positive effect on the weekly household disposable income of lone parents. Help for lone parents is particularly important in reducing child poverty. While helping household incomes is fundamental in our ambition to provide every child with the best start, the budget also reflects a much wider commitment to ensure children realise their potential and escape the intergenerational cycle of poverty. This can be seen in a range of long-term investments for children in poverty, such as measures to reduce educational disadvantage, the national childcare scheme and the extension of free GP care to children. These investments are how we will create lasting and far-reaching change in children’s lives. What this report reveals is that our new focus is accelerating and deepening our ambition in this critical area. When we published the child poverty and well-being programme just a couple of months ago, we set out an initial 2.5-year plan.This is the first budget in the programme and establishes the groundwork for increased co-ordination on action on child poverty and child well-being in the coming years. I was listening attentively to Deputy Ó Broin. I think he may be correct that most people in emergency accommodation are there for six to 12 months and not six to nine months, which is what I may have said. I think he said that only applies to Dublin but I will have to double-check that point.	spk_97
#LeoVaradkar	2023-11-28	dail	33	An Garda Síochána	dbsect_10	That is true.	spk_99
#LeoVaradkar	2023-11-28	dail	33	An Garda Síochána	dbsect_10	I thank Deputies for their questions. Deputy Murnane O'Connor mentioned DEIS schools and the need for more educational welfare officers. We always need to remind ourselves that, while many children experience disadvantage in DEIS schools, most children who experience disadvantage are not in DEIS schools. That is why extending the hot school meals programme to non-DEIS schools is really important and is being pursued by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and it is why I am so supportive of the Minister, Deputy Foley, in making sure free schoolbooks are provided on a universal basis. Just applying it to DEIS schools would leave out a huge number of children who suffer disadvantage but do not go to such schools. Nobody wants to see a means-testing system for something like schoolbooks. That is why we have gone for a universal basis. I agree on the need to improve the provision of therapies. That is why we are training more therapists. I will have to come back to Deputy O'Sullivan on the question around CDNTs and therapy assistants. I do not have those figures. Deputy McAuliffe pointed out budget 2024 is progressive, that lone parent households benefit the most and that it will reduce child poverty. It is important we build on that in future budgets. I agree with him on the value of area-based action and the work that needs to be done in Ballymun. We have seen good results in Drogheda. What happened last Thursday night is a huge blow to people living in the north-east inner city. Some people will try to say the task force and investment there have not worked. I do not agree with that. I have been there many times and know what is being invested in the north-east inner city has made a difference to the lives of thousands of people living in that part of our capital city. Some people will say, incorrectly, that those involved in the disturbances and rioting were from the area but it is interesting to put on the record of the Dáil, as mentioned in an article in  Deputy Boyd Barrett raised the issue of two young boys. I did not catch their names but he said they had a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy, which is an extremely rare dual diagnosis. I am certain it is an exceptional case. Allocations are a matter for the local authority but I am happy to look into it and see if I can help, if the Deputy will pass on the details to my office. Deputy Murphy raised CARI, which provides a hugely valuable service which we need to continue.I am advised by the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, that an additional allocation has been made for this year to allow CARI to continue its work for the rest of this calendar year and that it will try to sort out arrangements for 2024 with Tusla.	spk_105
#LeoVaradkar	2023-11-28	dail	33	An Garda Síochána	dbsect_10	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 9, inclusive, together. I met with the Prime Minister of France, Élisabeth Borne, in Government Buildings on Monday, 13 November. We discussed the close and strengthening ties between our two countries, as well as current EU and international issues. France is Ireland’s nearest neighbour in the European Union, and we share a deep commitment to the European project as the bedrock of peace, prosperity and well-being on our Continent. We acknowledged the significant progress being made under our joint plan of action for bilateral co-operation, which was agreed when President Macron visited Dublin in 2021. Highlights include new education and research partnerships between Irish and French institutions and significantly expanded transport links. Work is under way on integrated sail-rail ticketing between Ireland and France, which we hope to have in place for the Paris Olympic Games next year. Prime Minister Borne and I welcomed the joint declaration of intent on energy transition co-operation that was signed by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and his French counterpart, Agnès Pannier-Runacher, during the visit. Construction of the Celtic interconnector between France and Ireland has now commenced. I hope we will see a second interconnector to France in the coming years because we will need it. In our discussion of shared EU challenges, Prime Minister Borne and I agreed that Europe needs to improve its competitiveness and resilience, and accelerate the green and digital transitions, while responding to a very uncertain world. We also discussed the mid-term review of the EU budget, and the forthcoming discussion at the December European Council on EU enlargement. We reiterated our shared and unwavering support to Ukraine and its people, and our continued commitment to providing it with the financial and other supports it needs. We also discussed the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the West Bank, the urgent need for a ceasefire and the importance of EU partners working together to bring about a just and lasting peace between Israel and Palestine, based on a two-state solution. France and Ireland will continue to work closely on these and other issues, both within the EU and at the UN. Following our meeting at Government Buildings, I accompanied Prime Minister Borne to Iveagh House where we both spoke at a conference to mark the 225th anniversary of the Year of the French, when forces of the French Republic sailed from La Rochelle to Killala help the Irish rebellion in 1798.	spk_106
#LeoVaradkar	2023-11-28	dail	33	An Garda Síochána	dbsect_10	I recognise Deputy Haughey for talking about the Year of the French in 1798. It is fascinating how it still lives on in our folk memory even though it was a relatively small force and ultimately unsuccessful. It led to the creation of Ireland's first republic, the short-lived Republic of Connacht. We know from historical accounts that people were impressed to see a citizen army in operation in a way they had not seen previously. It helped inspire our own form of republicanism - genuine republicanism - in the following centuries. Concerning my conversation with Prime Minister Borne, it was a few weeks ago, before the ceasefire was in place. Our focus was on a ceasefire rather than the medium or long term. It was also a day or two after, I think, she participated in the anti-Semitism march in Paris. We talked about that and the concerns we both have about rising anti-Semitism and rising Islamophobia. From the Irish Government's point of view, we very much welcome the ceasefire in Gaza. It has facilitated the release of hostages taken by Hamas and prisoners taken by Israel, many of whom are teenage boys, in some cases subject to administrative detention for throwing stones. It has also allowed humanitarian aid and supplies into the territory, which is really important. We are calling for an extended ceasefire so that all hostages can be released - all hostages should be released - civilians can get further relief and the killing can stop. When we say ceasefire, to be clear, we mean a ceasefire observed by all sides and parties in the conflict. EU aid to Palestine has trebled. We increased our aid to the occupied Palestinian territories through UNRWA and other bodies. We are not in favour of new unnecessary restrictions on aid. We know from the aid we and the EU provide to the area that if there is evidence of it being somehow misappropriated, it is extremely weak. I welcome the report on that. Concerning sanctions, I can only say what I said before. I do not believe sanctions work if they are unilateral. They would likely backfire because there would be retaliation, which is the truth. The whole point of one country imposing sanctions on another is that it should do more harm to the country on which you impose sanctions than to yourself. Sanctions can only work if they are done on a multilateral basis. They only worked in respect of South Africa because they were multilateral.	spk_111
#LeoVaradkar	2023-11-28	dail	33	An Garda Síochána	dbsect_10	No, we discussed the need for a ceasefire. Thankfully, we have that now and it has facilitated the release of hostages and prisoners and allowed aid to get into Gaza. We did not talk about the medium or long term. On the other matter, I spoke to our ambassador to Israel last night. She was one of a number of EU ambassadors summoned. I assure the Deputy that she was able to both explain and defend the position of the Irish Government on all of these matters.	spk_113
#LeoVaradkar	2023-11-28	dail	33	An Garda Síochána	dbsect_10	I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 16, inclusive, together. A Policing Service for our Future is the Government’s plan to implement the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland. Implementation of the plan is being overseen by a dedicated programme office in the Department of the Taoiseach and has entered the final consolidation phase, with many substantive reforms already attained. This phase is expected to conclude with the introduction of the enhanced governance and accountability framework set out in the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill 2023 in the coming months. Major reforms to date include progressing the operating model for An Garda Síochána, which will enable a more visible, responsive and localised policing service to communities nationwide; recruitment of more than 3,300 Garda staff, which has resulted in the reassignment of many gardaí to front-line policing duties; distribution of nearly 14,000 digital communication devices, enabling front-line gardaí to perform their duties without returning to stations; implementation of new human rights structures, strategies and training across the organisation; and the introduction of a three-year Garda health and wellbeing strategy, which recognises the enormous stresses gardaí can face in the course of their work. There has also been legislative reform. The landmark Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill 2023 provides for the most wide-ranging and coherent reform of policing in a generation. It is anticipated that this Bill will be enacted before the end of the year, with early commencement envisaged. The Garda Síochána (Digital Recordings) Bill concerns the use of recording devices, including body-worn cameras. In June, the Cabinet approved the drafting of a general scheme for facial recognition technology legislation. This new Bill will be standalone and deals with concerns raised on facial and object recognition technology and will allow for prioritisation of the enactment of the Recording Devices Bill 2022 before the end of the year. The Garda Síochána (Powers) Bill combines and modernises police powers of search, arrest and detention. In addition, the Garda Síochána (Functions and Operational Areas) Act came into law in 2022 to underpin the new operating model. These developments represent only some of a wide range of actions completed or being progressed. The implementation group on policing reform is currently focused on arrangements for ensuring the smooth transition to new statutory governance and oversight arrangements. Policing reform has always been a live process and there has always been discretion to adapt to circumstances as need demands, particularly in the light of events such as the disorder in Dublin last Thursday. We have provided a further €10 million for Garda overtime in the city until the end of the year, which is being spent on high-visibility policing in the capital. The Minister for Justice has instructed her officials to include riot and violent disorder in the new facial recognition Bill, which will be ready to go to Government within weeks and will allow for rioters to be brought to justice more readily. We are also accelerating work to recruit more gardaí after the Covid-induced pause. There will be 700 to 800 new recruits this year and 800 to 1,000 next year. These and other actions by the Government show we will not be found wanting in support of An Garda Síochána as it fights crime and disorder.	spk_114
#LeoVaradkar	2023-11-28	dail	33	An Garda Síochána	dbsect_10	I thank the Deputies for their contributions. Deputy Dillon asked about examining the Children Act. I am not aware of any plans to do so, but I will come back to him on that. However, the fact that we treat juveniles differently in the criminal justice system is not a bad thing, and it does not mean juveniles are immune from the law. They are accountable for their actions. That is why we have antisocial behaviour orders and the juvenile diversion programme. It is why we have Oberstown if detention is needed. Deputy Barry again asked me to interpret the words of the Garda Commissioner. I am not able to interpret his words for him, or for anyone. He was probably referring to how the situation developed on the day, and not the fact it could not have happened. We have all been aware of violent protests in many places in the city, including on the outskirts of the city, and we know what the potential is. Last Thursday, I spoke at a business lunch and was back in the office that afternoon as news was coming through of the terrible stabbings in Parnell Square. The moment I heard it being reported that the assailant was an Algerian national, I was concerned there would be big trouble. I was in touch with the Minister for Justice about the matter within moments. Putting that information about was extremely irresponsible. We now know that some of the victims come from a migrant background. We know many of the people who intervened to save lives and stop it being worse are of a migrant background. While the current suspect is of a migrant background, he has spent more than 20 years in the country. He is an Irish citizen and is not known to the Department of Social Protection.The more we find out about it, the harder it is to understand exactly what happened, but we need to find out what did and why. Regarding Deputy O'Sullivan's question on the use of force, we ask gardaí to use all necessary force to do their job and also to protect themselves, which is also important. What none of us wants is the use of excessive force. For gardaí, it must be hard to get it right. How much force is the right amount of force to use and how does one make that decision in a rapidly developing situation when one does not necessarily know what is going on behind one or what is going on in other places? We have to make sure that they have the best equipment to protect themselves. Bodycams are a big part of that. The Minister for Justice's reform programme includes the latter. I hope we can have them very soon. CCTV is part of it as well. We have to make sure that they have the best possible training as well and that, if they do use necessary force, they are supported by Garda management and the Government. They will be, but I do not want anyone to get this wrong. If excessive force had been used - thankfully, it was not - we would probably be having a different conversation today.	spk_121

I assure the Deputy that she was able to both explain and defend the position of the Irish Government on all of these matters.	spk_113
#LeoVaradkar	2023-11-28	dail	33	An Garda Síochána	dbsect_13	I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 16, inclusive, together. A Policing Service for our Future is the Government’s plan to implement the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland. Implementation of the plan is being overseen by a dedicated programme office in the Department of the Taoiseach and has entered the final consolidation phase, with many substantive reforms already attained. This phase is expected to conclude with the introduction of the enhanced governance and accountability framework set out in the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill 2023 in the coming months. Major reforms to date include progressing the operating model for An Garda Síochána, which will enable a more visible, responsive and localised policing service to communities nationwide; recruitment of more than 3,300 Garda staff, which has resulted in the reassignment of many gardaí to front-line policing duties; distribution of nearly 14,000 digital communication devices, enabling front-line gardaí to perform their duties without returning to stations; implementation of new human rights structures, strategies and training across the organisation; and the introduction of a three-year Garda health and wellbeing strategy, which recognises the enormous stresses gardaí can face in the course of their work. There has also been legislative reform. The landmark Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill 2023 provides for the most wide-ranging and coherent reform of policing in a generation. It is anticipated that this Bill will be enacted before the end of the year, with early commencement envisaged. The Garda Síochána (Digital Recordings) Bill concerns the use of recording devices, including body-worn cameras. In June, the Cabinet approved the drafting of a general scheme for facial recognition technology legislation. This new Bill will be standalone and deals with concerns raised on facial and object recognition technology and will allow for prioritisation of the enactment of the Recording Devices Bill 2022 before the end of the year. The Garda Síochána (Powers) Bill combines and modernises police powers of search, arrest and detention. In addition, the Garda Síochána (Functions and Operational Areas) Act came into law in 2022 to underpin the new operating model. These developments represent only some of a wide range of actions completed or being progressed. The implementation group on policing reform is currently focused on arrangements for ensuring the smooth transition to new statutory governance and oversight arrangements. Policing reform has always been a live process and there has always been discretion to adapt to circumstances as need demands, particularly in the light of events such as the disorder in Dublin last Thursday. We have provided a further €10 million for Garda overtime in the city until the end of the year, which is being spent on high-visibility policing in the capital. The Minister for Justice has instructed her officials to include riot and violent disorder in the new facial recognition Bill, which will be ready to go to Government within weeks and will allow for rioters to be brought to justice more readily. We are also accelerating work to recruit more gardaí after the Covid-induced pause. There will be 700 to 800 new recruits this year and 800 to 1,000 next year. These and other actions by the Government show we will not be found wanting in support of An Garda Síochána as it fights crime and disorder.	spk_114
#LeoVaradkar	2023-11-28	dail	33	An Garda Síochána	dbsect_13	I thank the Deputies for their contributions. Deputy Dillon asked about examining the Children Act. I am not aware of any plans to do so, but I will come back to him on that. However, the fact that we treat juveniles differently in the criminal justice system is not a bad thing, and it does not mean juveniles are immune from the law. They are accountable for their actions. That is why we have antisocial behaviour orders and the juvenile diversion programme. It is why we have Oberstown if detention is needed. Deputy Barry again asked me to interpret the words of the Garda Commissioner. I am not able to interpret his words for him, or for anyone. He was probably referring to how the situation developed on the day, and not the fact it could not have happened. We have all been aware of violent protests in many places in the city, including on the outskirts of the city, and we know what the potential is. Last Thursday, I spoke at a business lunch and was back in the office that afternoon as news was coming through of the terrible stabbings in Parnell Square. The moment I heard it being reported that the assailant was an Algerian national, I was concerned there would be big trouble. I was in touch with the Minister for Justice about the matter within moments. Putting that information about was extremely irresponsible. We now know that some of the victims come from a migrant background. We know many of the people who intervened to save lives and stop it being worse are of a migrant background. While the current suspect is of a migrant background, he has spent more than 20 years in the country. He is an Irish citizen and is not known to the Department of Social Protection.The more we find out about it, the harder it is to understand exactly what happened, but we need to find out what did and why. Regarding Deputy O'Sullivan's question on the use of force, we ask gardaí to use all necessary force to do their job and also to protect themselves, which is also important. What none of us wants is the use of excessive force. For gardaí, it must be hard to get it right. How much force is the right amount of force to use and how does one make that decision in a rapidly developing situation when one does not necessarily know what is going on behind one or what is going on in other places? We have to make sure that they have the best equipment to protect themselves. Bodycams are a big part of that. The Minister for Justice's reform programme includes the latter. I hope we can have them very soon. CCTV is part of it as well. We have to make sure that they have the best possible training as well and that, if they do use necessary force, they are supported by Garda management and the Government. They will be, but I do not want anyone to get this wrong. If excessive force had been used - thankfully, it was not - we would probably be having a different conversation today.	spk_121
#LeoVaradkar	2023-11-28	dail	33	Policing, Protests and Public Order: Statements	dbsect_14	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on the dreadful events that occurred in Dublin last week - the stabbing of a woman and several schoolchildren, the far-right protest that followed, and then the riot, looting and criminal damage. We are all still coming to terms with what happened, what it means and how we might respond further. The Government and the Garda are already working on it, but we are also keen to hear feedback from the community, from colleagues here in the House, and from elsewhere. As the House knows, our country experienced two attacks last Thursday. The first was an attack on innocent children and their care worker outside Gaelscoil Choláiste Mhuire in Dublin’s city centre. It was an unthinkable act of violence, and my thoughts are with the injured children, their heroic care worker and all those who stepped in and risked their lives. As I said last week, these are all real Irish heroes, whatever their nationality. On Sunday night, I had the opportunity to meet four of them from Ireland, Brazil and France. What transpired shortly afterwards was an attack on our society and on the rule of law. Gabhaim buíochas leis na gardaí agus leis na hoibrithe túslíne go léir as a bhfreagra misniúil ar imeachtaí na seachtaine seo caite. Mar Rialtas, beimid gan staonadh ó thaobh ár saoránaigh agus ár ndaoine a chosaint. Beidh na gardaí ar na sráideanna agus déanfaidh siad aon rud atá ag teastáil ionas go mothóidh daoine sábháilte. Agus déanfaimid cinnte go bhfuil na hacmhainní, an trealamh agus na dlíthe acu a theastaíonn chun a gcuid oibre a dhéanamh. My thanks to the gardaí and all the front-line workers for their courageous response to last week’s events and to the council workers and transport workers who were also affected and carried out the clean-up. I offer my solidarity to the workers in retail and other establishments in the area, many of whom were detained for a period of time against their will. As a Government, we will be relentless in protecting our citizens and defending our people. Gardaí will be on the streets and will do whatever it takes to make people feel safe, and we will make sure that they have the resources, the equipment and the laws needed to do their job. The riots on Thursday evening were shocking to us. They are not something we are used to in Ireland and not something we want to get used to and see normalised or repeated. We have to ensure that what happened on Thursday were exceptional events. We need to work ensure they never happen again. It is also important, though, to take a step back and consider the fact that, in response to a rapidly evolving situation, gardaí regained control of the streets within hours and prevented the riots from spreading beyond a confined area of the city. Over 400 members of An Garda Síochána were deployed in Dublin city centre, including over 220 public order gardaí, and 34 people were immediately arrested. An Garda Síochána has been maintaining a strong presence in the area since then, including a significant public order capacity involving dog and mounted units. Water cannon are available, if needed. My thanks to all members of An Garda Síochána for their rapid response in difficult circumstances, particularly those who answered the call from other parts of the country. They should be commended for their response, not criticised. Policing such events is unpredictable and high risk by its nature. To the best of my knowledge, none of us in this House have much expertise of policing or riot policing. This is the reason An Garda Síochána has operational control over such matters. That is not to say that we cannot learn from what happened. The political system has an important role to play at national and local levels, and that role continues. It must be about much more than calling for heads to roll. I have been in regular contact with the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and the Garda Commissioner since last Thursday. I have committed, as Taoiseach, that the full weight of the State will be available in how we respond. Deputy McEntee has shown how much work she can get done as Minister for Justice, and she will be doing plenty more. We have opened two new Garda stations in Dublin city centre - on O'Connell Street and Fitzgibbon Street - as well as a new Garda station in Dublin Port. The Garda budget is now at its highest ever - 23% higher than in 2020 when this Government came to office, standing now at €2.3 billion. Interest in joining An Garda Síochána is strong and encouraging, with between 700 and 800 new recruits entering the Garda College this year. The Opposition would like us to forget that Covid led to the closure of the Garda Training College and that we are recovering and catching up from that. Garda numbers are recovering. We expect them to stabilise this year at around 14,000 and rise again next year to about 14,500 by the end of the year. We also have over 3,000 Garda staff, which frees up sworn members for duties. We have increased the Garda training allowance by two thirds and increased the age of entry from 35 to 50 years. The retirement age will also be increased so that we can hold onto experienced officers. The Garda fleet now stands at around 3,500, up over 10% since this Government came to office, with more than 100 new vehicles on order. When it comes to stronger laws, the Minister has doubled the maximum sentence for assault causing harm to ten years, increased the sentence for conspiracy to murder from ten years to life and increased the sentence for assaulting a garda or emergency worker from seven years to 12 years. We will also streamline community CCTV and allow for the introduction of body-worn cameras, modernise our laws on hate crimes and incitement to hatred, introduce facial and object recognition technology and propose extending the range of offences in respect of which that technology may be used to include the offences of riot and violent disorder in a stand-alone Bill so that there is proper scrutiny. It does not surprise me that Members of this House have called for resignations, but I do not think that is the right approach. In fact, in many ways, those who conducted the riot and damaged our city last Thursday will see it as a victory. It may even embolden them. Interfering in who gets appointed to or removed from positions such as the Garda Commissioner should not be taken lightly. It should not be taken as the normal cut and thrust of politics. It has consequences and it can be corrosive to the wider justice system and public safety. In the past few weeks, we have seen the resignation of the Chief Constable in Northern Ireland. Here in this Chamber, we have seen justice Ministers have their reputations destroyed, with the Chamber and Opposition acting as judge, jury and executioner, only for those justice Ministers to be vindicated at a later date. I do not believe that should happen again. We know that we need to do more to make sure that people feel safer in Dublin’s inner city. We know that we have not got everything right and that a lot more needs to be done. We know that the work that is now well under way in terms of extra gardaí, better equipment and stronger laws needs to be accelerated. I will make sure that there is leadership from my office in that regard. Above all, I believe that this is a time to support An Garda Síochána, support the Commissioner and support the Minister for Justice. It is a time to work together on behalf of the people who elected us. I do not believe it is in their interests to sow division.	spk_122
