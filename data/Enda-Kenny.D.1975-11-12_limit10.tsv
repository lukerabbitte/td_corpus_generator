Enda Kenny	66	Fine Gael	Mayo	#EndaKenny	2017-12-05	dail	32	Personal Explanation by Member	dbsect_36	In the Dáil on 17 November 2004 statements were allowed on the abduction and murder of Margaret Hassan, an Irish national in Iraq. During the course of those statements I said Margaret Hassan had converted to Islam. This statement was untrue. Margaret Hassan was a devout Catholic who continued to practice her religion during the years she was in Iraq. I wish, therefore, to have the Official Report for the Dáil of 17 November 2004 corrected to indicate that Margaret Hassan had not converted to Islam but was, in fact, a devout and practising Catholic. I regret not having done so prior to this. While her body has never been recovered, I hope some day that will happen and that she will receive a Christian burial.	spk_264

Enda Kenny	66	Fine Gael	Mayo	#EndaKenny	2017-06-14	dail	32	Nomination of Taoiseach	dbsect_3	Tairgim:Go n-ainmneoidh Dáil Éireann an Teachta Leo Varadkar le bheith ceaptha ag an Uachtarán mar Thaoiseach. I move:That Dáil Éireann nominate Deputy Leo Varadkar for appointment by the President to be Taoiseach. Having worked closely with Deputy Varadkar throughout his political career I am confident that he will carry out the role of An Taoiseach with energy, integrity and skill. From his deep involvement in the Young Fine Gael movement as a young student to his election to Fingal County Council in 2004 and his election to this House, Dáil Éireann, in 2007, Deputy Varadkar has demonstrated the drive and the commitment that are required to succeed in politics. Immediately upon his election to this House I appointed him to the Fine Gael Front Bench, first in the enterprise brief and later as spokesman on energy and communications. In both roles he worked diligently in developing new and innovative policy proposals. Since then I had the privilege of being first elected Taoiseach in 2011 and have had the privilege of appointing Deputy Varadkar to three separate Cabinet positions, as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Minister for Health and more recently as Minister for Social Protection. In each of these Ministries Deputy Varadkar has had significant achievements, whether the revitalisation of the tourism industry, the oversight of The Gathering, stabilising the health service and rolling out free general practitioner, GP, care for children younger than six years or increasing the weekly payments to those dependent on social welfare. In 2011 the Irish people elected a new Government to rescue the economy, to get Ireland working again and Deputy Varadkar in his Ministries was central to that work. Today our country is in a much stronger position than previously, the troika has left, unemployment has fallen dramatically and the public finances are in very good shape. However, many challenges remain, not least in areas such as health and housing and child poverty. We must continue to manage the economy carefully so that it generates the resources that we need to rebuild our essential public services. As Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar will meet these challenges head on, including Brexit and Ireland's future place in the European Union. As the country's youngest holder of this office he will speak for a new generation of Irishwomen and Irishmen. He represents a modern, diverse and inclusive Ireland and will speak for it like no other, an Ireland in which each person can fulfil his or her potential and live his or her dreams. I wish Deputy Varadkar and his team every success in the challenges that lie ahead. I have no doubt but that he will build on the solid foundations on which our country now stands and that he will see that it is managed carefully in the people's interests and that the decisions his Government will make will always hold the people as central to those decisions. I therefore commend his name to the House for selection as Taoiseach of Ireland.	spk_3
Enda Kenny	66	Fine Gael	Mayo	#EndaKenny	2017-06-13	dail	32	Resignation of Taoiseach	dbsect_2	"Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Nach iontach ar fad go bhfuil slua mór anseo inniu. Ba mhaith liom a chur in iúl duit, a Cheann Comhairle, tar éis ghnó na Dála seo, go mbeidh mé ag dul amach go hÁras an Uachtaráin, go dtabharfaidh mé litir ag éirí as an bpost seo chuig an Uachtarán agus go mbeidh sé sin ag dul i bhfeidhm láithreach.I was hoping that having said that much, I could leave quickly and quietly but the business of the Dáil is such that I no longer have any control over how it is to be conducted. The prospect of making a speech or listening to them, either of glorification or flagellation, is not something that I really relish because this has never been about me. It has always been about the problems and challenges our people and country face. That said, I am very happy to have the opportunity to thank the Ceann Comhairle, his predecessors and all the staff of the House for their assistance and unfailing courtesy not just over the last six years as Taoiseach but over the past 42 years since I have been a Member of the House. It was Teddy Roosevelt who said ""Far and away the best prize that life has to offer is the chance to work hard at work worth doing."" I have been truly blessed I have had that chance. I am eternally grateful to the Irish people and particularly the people of Mayo for repeatedly giving me that opportunity. I really believe that politics is work worth doing, a noble profession. Despite the many scandals and disappointments, I believe the vast majority of people elected to this House are here because we have an interest in and love for our communities and country and we wish to make a difference. For me, cynicism is always an easy cop-out. The true measure of worth and courage is to keep trying again and again, knowing that much of that effort will go unrewarded. I understand the people's disillusionment with politics and the political process. I believe that a first step towards overcoming that might be for us as politicians to treat one other with a greater degree of respect. We can argue vehemently the merits of issues or measures without questioning one another's motives or intent. Politics is always about people and government is always about making decisions. For my own part, I am the first to acknowledge I have not got everything right but I can honestly say my motivation was always what I believed was in the best interests of the Irish people. I thank my colleagues in government for their efforts and support in trying to make an unprecedented and difficult situation work. I also wish to recognise the contributions of the Members opposite, of the Fianna Fáil Party with their leader, Deputy Micheál Martin. It would be remiss of me not to mention the Labour Party for its enormous contribution to the success of the last Government, which under the leadership of Eamon Gilmore and Deputy Joan Burton, with the central involvement of the current leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Brendan Howlin, played a critical role in the rescue of the economy. I thank them all for that. To my party colleagues, I want to say it has been a privilege and a pleasure to have had the opportunity to lead the party for 15 years, and the last six years in government. I wish them all good health to continue the work to overcome and deal with the many challenges that lie ahead.  I passed through Strade recently, which is the birthplace and final resting place of Michael Davitt. To paraphrase what he said in his will to the Irish people, to all my friends I leave kind thoughts, to others I express my fullest forgiveness and to Ireland my undying prayer for absolute freedom and independence, which it has always been my ambition to achieve for her. I hope that in the two Governments I have led, we have made a modest contribution towards that ambition. "	spk_2
Enda Kenny	66	Fine Gael	Mayo	#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_20	Deputy Martin is asking what action the Government took on the basis of the circumstances in which we found ourselves in 2011. Some €20 billion had been invested by the taxpayer. Jobs were haemorrhaging by the tens of thousands, interest rates on money borrowed by the country were 15% and unemployment was rising. We set out to improve that position, and that is what has happened in terms of the interest rates on the promissory note and the leverage we have at a European level. As I said, €20 billion of taxpayers' money was put into what was supposed to be the greatest deal of all, that is, a €64 billion debt burden on our people. We recovered €6.6 billion through capital repayments, interest, income and fees. The State still owns 99.9% of the ordinary share capital and a further €0.2 billion has been paid to the State through the bank levy. The primary objective of the State was to recover all of the investment from AIB. The Minister for Finance believes that is a realistic objective over a period of time. I said to Deputy Martin yesterday that the sale of the bank shares would not result in any beneficial impact on the general Government balance as it would not be counted as revenue. Therefore, there is no increased capacity to spend. The proceeds from any IPO would be used to pay down debt, and the Minister has made that perfectly clear. We are now in the process of being in a much stronger position than we were, with almost full employment, and the deficit is to be eliminated next year. There are serious challenges in terms of the level of personal debt that applies.  The negotiations are now beginning, with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, on an extension of the Lansdowne Road agreement and a review of the capital programme. Significant amounts of money still remain unallocated. The Government has made decisions on the unprecedented levels of money available for dealing with the housing crisis.  As I have pointed out, the Government has made decisions to work with the European Investment Bank on further, long-term, low interest funds for major pieces of infrastructure. The challenges ahead are ones the Government is already looking at, not in the way Governments of the past looked at the development of a spatial strategy. People on this side wrote down 53 towns to be developed, but nothing ever happened.  Ireland will increase its population by 1 million people over the next number of years and we will need 500,000 houses. We have to consider how those people will be transported. The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment is delivering elements of the programme for broadband and a national contract is to be issued for that next year. There is a contract in place with Eir for the provision of fibre broadband to homes in many places. The Minister has been very clear that now is the optimum time to dispose of a portion of AIB, leaving the State with a very significant holding. Obviously, advice was received on a constant basis but the opportunity did not present itself in the way it does now. It is not a case of not examining the infrastructure requirements we have. They are very big priorities for Government. In this particular case, as has been pointed out, it is a transaction that does not result in any increased spending money and will, therefore, be used to write down debt, as the Minister has confirmed on many occasions.	spk_86
Enda Kenny	66	Fine Gael	Mayo	#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_20	The Minister for Finance has repeatedly identified the particular demographics of this country having regard to these rules. Money has to be paid back and capital is treated differently from current funding. It is not a case of not focusing on the priorities we have all identified. The Government has put forward €5 billion for housing.	spk_88
Enda Kenny	66	Fine Gael	Mayo	#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_20	The problem here is to get the system moving from the total collapse of a number of years ago to provide the number of houses, social and everything else, that is now needed. The Minister has raised the question of the treatment of capital at European level in his discussions with finance ministers but it has to be paid back. I know Deputy Martin supports the proportionate sale of AIB here. Obviously, the question of demographics has been raised by us repeatedly and we have identified the kind of country we would like to see and the infrastructure it will require over the next ten, 15 and 20 years. There is a need for increased capital expenditure, but one has to have the engine of an economy to drive that. Clearly from a European point of view, investments that will come from the loan process with the European Investment Bank will have a significant impact on some of the very major infrastructure projects that lie ahead.	spk_91

Enda Kenny	66	Fine Gael	Mayo	#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_20	There are still many challenges ahead and I hope the Government continues to do its duty in office. It will focus entirely on decisions that will be made in the interests of the people. This is one decision that is in the interests of the people. The Minister has taken advice over a long period and the optimum time is now. The economic circumstances are very good and this is a test of the value - it will be floated on the stock exchange - of what a 25% offering for AIB will bring in. Over the next decade or so, it will bring about a situation in which private banking offers competition in the interests of a strong economy and an opportunity for people. Deputy Adams can stick with his mantra. He spoke to me last week about long goodbyes and I offered to wait for him. I understand the movement is now asserting that Deputy Adams should stand up and make a declaration as to his future intentions also.	spk_110
Enda Kenny	66	Fine Gael	Mayo	#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_20	I thank him for his consistency. I do not share his view. This is the right thing to do with AIB and now is the right time to do it.	spk_112

Enda Kenny	66	Fine Gael	Mayo	#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_20	They have left our shores and we have retrieved our sovereignty and restored our economic independence. Furthermore, we have also given the flag back to the people with a new sense of understanding and respect. Deputy Gerry Adams says this is in the interests of the bankers. There were 225,000 new jobs created in the past few years. The young men and young women of this country work to build our economy and international reputation and send the brand image that we are not afraid to face up to our challenges or make hard decisions and that we are not afraid to make sacrifices in the interests of everybody. While we have many challenges ahead, we are in a much better position than we were. Had we followed the Deputy's line, I hate to think where we would be now.	spk_124
Enda Kenny	66	Fine Gael	Mayo	#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_20	We have had a lot of discussions about this issue already. The Government made the decision, which the Houses accepted, that the Charleton inquiry should be set up. As I pointed out to Deputy Mick Barry yesterday, the appointment of Mr. Justice Charleton was exceptionally appropriate, having dealt with the Morris tribunal for over a decade in County Donegal. I prefer to let him and his commission do their work. I do not know whether the allegation about the particular phone being missing is true or not, but the justice has set out the timescale and the hearings that are to take place. There will be public hearings of the commission in July on this very issue. The Committee of Public Accounts is meeting this morning and I have heard some of the comments made about the discrepancies in some of the contributions being made. Be that as it may, the House has set up a commission of investigation, a tribunal, to deal with this matter and no better person than Mr. Justice Charleton to deal with it. The Deputy's question about the previous Commissioner was the subject of a full-scale commission of investigation which made its judgment and ruling. Obviously, the current Commissioner is one of the people whom I named yesterday as having legal representation at the Charleton inquiry. The hearings will take place in public in July, which is not too far distant. I expect Mr. Justice Charleton to find out the veracity of the allegations, the facts and the truth. That is why he was appointed.	spk_126
Enda Kenny	66	Fine Gael	Mayo	#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_20	The Deputy completely underestimates the capacity of Mr. Justice Charleton who is the sole member in charge of a full tribunal. He is not the kind of person who will be led astray by filtered information. Believe me, if the Deputy is suggesting the tribunal liaison group is deliberately filtering information to him that is either irrelevant or not meaningful, he is not the kind of person who will let it pass by.I have every faith in Mr. Justice Charleton doing 100% of what he has been appointed to do. He is not the type of person to accept information that might be filtered or which he might be asked to accept as being the full truth. His job is to find that out and I have 100% faith in him doing that. The people who appear before him had better be very clear in the answers they give him.	spk_128

I hope to see him in Pearse Stadium on Sunday week and I hope he will be as kind to me then when we take to the field.

Enda Kenny	66	Fine Gael	Mayo	#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Leaders' Questions	dbsect_20	They might not have been my supporters when my friend Richard took to the field some years ago. Be that as it may, I was happy to appoint them to Front Bench positions, to watch them grow as Ministers and to bring about a situation where they have actively and vigorously campaigned around the country for the last number of weeks for the right to lead this party. Whatever the decision of the Fine Gael electorate is, I hope that whoever is elected leader of the party will continue in government and will always make decisions in the interests of our people. Every decision it makes and every step the Government takes should be about the country and the people. I am sure that is deeply embedded in their political philosophy. From my perspective, I have been a Member of the House for a long time. I have seen all the tensions and all the outbreaks of viciousness and sometimes fisticuffs when people were being either moved on after elections or shoved out the gate. I have always made it clear that instinct is important for politicians and, indeed, sports people. After 42 years in the House, 13 elections, 15 years as leader of a major party and six years as Taoiseach, I am happy to be in a position to transfer responsibility to a younger generation. That is important in all walks of life. As for advice, it is a little later than people think and there is no time to waste. When the new Government is appointed, in whatever structure that might be, it must get on with challenges we face of keeping our economy moving, dealing with child poverty and homelessness, the provision of employment and creating the infrastructure we spoke about for the people who will live in this country over the next 30 or 40 years. As for regrets, I do not have any. Anybody who holds the position of Taoiseach had better have an optimistic and positive outlook. There is no point in going around looking like one is weighed down with the problems of the world.	spk_140

Enda Kenny	66	Fine Gael	Mayo	#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_21	I agree with the Deputy that boxing is not in crisis. The sports capital system has supported boxing clubs during the terms of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments over the years. The number of young boys and girls involved in boxing as a discipline, science and sport continues to increase. On Monday, I was in the north inner city and visited Ballybough Boxing Club. It has brand new facilities and really good coaches and it is doing a wonderful job. I am a big supporter of Bernard Dunne. He is a wonderful example to young people. He rose to become world champion in his weight division. I hope the personalities involved in the matter raised by the Deputy can work this out. As the Deputy rightly pointed out, Irish boxers have been very successful in many Olympic Games. Ireland is recognised by other countries as being outstanding in this regard and one of the top countries in the world. I hope, therefore, that the powers that be, or the personalities within the IABA, along with the Minister of State dealing with this, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, and the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, can come to an understanding that is in the interest of thousands of young people and in order that there will be a body that works in everybody's interest. After all, the Deputy's Government and a succession of Governments have put money into the facilities in Dublin and around the country. Through these, young people learn discipline, character formation and the science of boxing, if that is what they love. It is a sport in which they can rise to be world champions in their respective weight divisions. The Deputy's message is one that I fully understand.	spk_151
Enda Kenny	66	Fine Gael	Mayo	#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Questions on Promised Legislation	dbsect_21	This is an important judgment by the Supreme Court. The Tánaiste, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and the Minister of State with direct responsibility in this area, Deputy David Stanton, have done a lot of work on this. Within the past month, before this judgment, they asked their officials to begin work to identify the options for and the barriers to asylum seekers gaining access to the labour market in particular circumstances. This judgment, therefore, gives this work increased priority. As the judgment has only just become available, as the Deputy is aware, the Department of Justice and Equality officials, together with the Office of the Attorney General, will examine it in the immediate future. It is important to note that the International Protection Act, which introduces the single application procedure for protection applicants, was brought through the Oireachtas by the Tánaiste and commenced on 30 December 2016. That is important legislation. The new Act is specifically designed to address the delays in decision-making on asylum claims. Since the beginning of the year, applications have already been decided with applicants having been recognised as refugees who can access the labour market now. Overall, 92% of the 173 recommendations in the McMahon report are now implemented or partially implemented, or are in progress. That is a significant increase on the figure of 80% in the first audit of progress, which was published last June. One hundred and twenty-one of the recommendations are now implemented, with a further 38 partially implemented or in progress. It includes the key recommendation of the working group, that is, the one on the introduction of the single application procedure within our international protection process. I do not have any difficulty at all in saying to the Deputy that the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, in particular, will be happy to engage with Opposition Members to discuss the outcome of the ruling of the Supreme Court. I expect that once officials from the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Justice and Equality have gone through the judgment in detail, the Minister of State will be very happy to have a discussion with Opposition Members and move on in the context of the findings of the Supreme Court.	spk_153

The detail of the strategic development zone in this case outlines the kinds of development that can take place within the almost 500 acres allocated for the zone around the entire airport facility. The local authority has already produced its local plan, which was the advice received a number of years ago, and the proposition through the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government was that the Government should now back this with approval for a strategic development zone. It is not a case of saying here is a certain amount of money. We now have the opportunity to follow through the development of that local authority plan with expedited planning permissions and business and commerce associated with the airline business, be that hangars or hotels. There is a range of issues that can now be followed through and put in that development zone. It is not a grant system that provides a certain amount of money.

My Department, as outlined in the strategy statement, provides support services for the Taoiseach and the Government. As part of this service, the parliamentary liaison unit was established to perform a liaison function to help ensure that Ministers and Departments are properly and fully informed of new responsibilities and procedures in the Thirty-second Dáil. The unit provides support to Ministers and their Departments on Oireachtas matters with a particular emphasis on assisting Departments with Private Members' business. It provides Departments with detailed information on the rules and procedures with regard to Private Members' business. In performing this function, the unit liaises on a regular basis with advisers to the Independent members of Government, including the chief strategist for the Independent Alliance and the political co-ordinator for the Independent Ministers in Government, to ensure that they are informed of Oireachtas issues and to assist them in engaging with the new processes arising from the Dáil reform changes. In this regard, the parliamentary liaison unit provides detailed information on upcoming matters in the Dáil and Seanad and highlights any new Oireachtas reform issues for their information.	spk_228

The same applies in the case of the Independent Alliance and any others who support the Government. All of these have been published. This liaison unit does not have anything to do with that. It is staffed by a principal officer, a higher executive officer and a clerical officer. As I said, it provides support for Ministers and their Departments on Oireachtas matters with particular emphasis on helping with Private Members' business. As the Deputy will be aware, amendments can be quite complex and detailed and the structures of that are explained to Ministers and their Departments as to what particular amendments might mean. The unit does not have any political function, for example, in dealing with Beaumont Hospital or a new emergency department there. That is an arrangement that has been agreed, between, in this case, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and the Government, and to fulfil that it must be able to be the subject of discussion by the Minister for Health and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and be in compliance with best practice. However, they all have been published. When Deputy Haughey states there is a need for transparency, openness and accountability, I share that view.

Enda Kenny	66	Fine Gael	Mayo	#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_25	In respect of the issue that the Deputy raises, it is important when an election is over that the judgment given by the people is then considered carefully to see is it possible to put a government together. It took some time to put this one together last year. It is a Government of the Fine Gael Party supported by the Independent Alliance, a number of Independents in Cabinet and some others outside, and of course, the main Opposition party, Fianna Fáil, in respect of a confidence and supply agreement. Part of the discussions that took place at the outset was about a change in the way that members of the Judiciary are appointed. Deputy Nolan will appreciate that the Constitution is clear in that the Government makes the appointments and the Cabinet must have choices when making those appointments.Part of the discussions with the Independent Alliance was about the nature of that structure. As the Deputies are aware, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, has been around for quite a number of years. That board assesses the credentials, legal experience and the kinds of cases that candidates may have heard to determine their suitability for appointment to the District Court, Circuit Court, High Court, Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court. What was approved yesterday by Government was the Judicial Appointments Bill which will now proceed through the Houses and hopefully become law this year. The other Bill in respect of the conduct and the oversight of conduct by members of the Judiciary is the Judicial Council Bill.  This does not represent a Minister stepping outside his brief. In this case, the Minister, Deputy Ross, working with his group of Deputies, said that this was an issue that they considered to be very important. It became a focus of discussion between the parties in terms of including it in the programme for Government. That is why it is there in the published document. In the case of Waterford, this was not an issue that came out of the blue suddenly. There was a very particular letter issued by the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, which had been considered very carefully by the medical personnel in Waterford. The Minister has responded with a mobile unit providing cardiac facilities in Waterford.	spk_234

I am very happy with the way that he goes about his business. In respect of what Deputy Howlin said, he will be aware from his own experience that Cabinet operates on the basis of collective responsibility. All the candidates whose names came to Cabinet were deemed to be experienced, professionally competent and suitable to be nominated to the particular bench to which they applied. It is not a case of somebody going through the file and the experience of each nominee-----	spk_247

I do not want to say anything about newspaper reports and analysis. All the nominees were cleared by the JAAB as being competent and professional. The new Bill, when it is passed, will reduce the number of nominees for each position but it will still be the responsibility of Cabinet, under the Constitution, to make the choices. I acknowledge the mobile unit is not yet in place. Obviously, the Minister for Health is conscious of that fact and is working on the matter. That was the outcome of the discussions that were held with the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, at the time.	spk_251
Enda Kenny	66	Fine Gael	Mayo	#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_25	I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive, together. I have restructured my Department to ensure that Brexit is treated as a crucial cross-cutting issue by creating an amalgamated international, EU and Northern Ireland division under a second Secretary General who also acts as the Government's Sherpa for EU business, including Brexit. The work of this division includes supporting the Cabinet committee on Brexit and the Cabinet committee on European affairs. There are 32 staff assigned to this division. The international, EU and Northern Ireland division comprises three sections.The international section advises me on international policy and supports me in my international engagements with a particular focus on driving economic growth, trade, investment and job creation, as well as protecting and strengthening Ireland’s strategic relationships, interests and reputation overseas. The EU section supports me in my role as a member of the European Council and provides a coherent, whole-of-Government strategic direction on priority EU policies, including on Brexit. The Britain and Northern Ireland affairs section supports my work and the work of the Government in helping to maintain peace and to develop new relationships on the island of Ireland and between Britain and Ireland. This section supports me and the Government in ensuring there is a whole-of-Government response to the UK’s decision to leave the EU and the implications of that decision for Northern Ireland and the British-Irish relationship. Staff in other divisions also contribute to the work on Brexit. For example, the economic policy division advises me on economic policy aimed at supporting sustainable economic growth, with a particular focus on jobs and competitiveness, including possible economic impacts of Brexit. I have three special advisers, including my chief of staff. The Government Chief Whip has two special advisers. The Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, the EU digital single market and data protection has one special adviser, whose salary is paid by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The Minister of State with responsibility for defence has two special advisers, both of whom are paid by the Department of Defence. The Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora has no special adviser. Although they are not special advisers, the chief strategist for the Independent Alliance and the political co-ordinator for Independent Ministers are also based in my Department.	spk_252
Enda Kenny	66	Fine Gael	Mayo	#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_25	I can supply Deputy Martin with the audit he mentioned. I will forward him the numbers we have in terms of the appointments of diplomats and other staff who are working in different places. The Deputy made the point previously that it may become necessary to recruit or appoint people with particular experience, for instance, in trade and in the complex issues involved in that area. There is a willingness that when it becomes necessary, we can and will do that. When the issue was raised about Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, as I said, they look for particular types of people, but these negotiations have not started. Deputy Howlin is right on this. We still have a great deal of information to get from those with whom we will negotiate. Deputy Howlin made the point about knowing the thinking of people at a European level. From his experience and from that of Deputy Martin as a former Minister, it is about the building of relationships that last over a long period.	spk_259

Enda Kenny	66	Fine Gael	Mayo	#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_25	Yes, but if somebody at the European Council will not accept the outcome of the deal, we will have a real problem. Deputy Howlin made a point about knowing the thinking of other European colleagues, and it takes time to build those relationships, but, as he is aware, it comes down to the European Council's decision, it is the Heads of Government who will make the ultimate decision. I take the Deputy's comments in the spirit that he made them. The presentation of our priorities, as we see them, without having all of the information in so far as what the British Government's thinking is on this, have been reflected in the Commission, Parliament and Council. However, as the Deputy pointed out, in terms of having as close as possible a working relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom, which is what we have now as a member of the European Union, that will be changed by virtue of the fact that the Single Market will be gone and the trading status will be changed. Therefore, when we go around that loop and come back to where we started we will be in a different position. Even if no tariffs will apply in terms of trade, we will still have two different jurisdictions and the complications that would involve are obvious. An Open Skies arrangement will have to be drawn up between the European Union and the United Kingdom, otherwise, aircraft will not be able to take off from here and land in London and go on to collect other passengers. That is an issue that needs to be dealt with and it is being worked upon now. We cannot wait for divorce to be concluded to do that.  The three issues identified by Michael Barnier here and agreed by Europe are the border, modalities and liabilities in terms of what the bill might be and the question of citizen's rights and reciprocal rights. All these matters, as was rightly said, were never put to the people in a way that they would have had a real discussion about understanding them. That is why our common travel area, which has been in place for 90 years covering travel, residence and the right to work and to draw social benefits, is a bilateral arrangement between Ireland and the UK and it is different with respect to rights of the Polish people or Lithuanians or Latvians who live in Great Britain. The European position is that if we want to have a parallel discussion begun, where we get into the meat of trade, we will have to make substantial progress in respect of the first three issues. I hear comments from some people across the water to the effect that progress will not be made on this, which clearly will lead to other complications.	spk_265
Enda Kenny	66	Fine Gael	Mayo	#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_25	I take the Deputy's point. A no deal situation would be catastrophic for Ireland in, for example, the beef and agrifood sectors. Deputy Nolan spoke about the Brexit position. We did not cause this, we were not responsible for it and we did not want it but we have to deal with it. In respecting the vote of the British electorate, clearly, the issues that are priority have been set out for us. Dr. Pfeiffer is perfectly entitled to his opinion but this is decided at the European Council from a European point of view. One can have all the opinions, all the ideas and all the propositions one wants but at the end of the day, political leaders have to make decisions and the choices sometimes are not very palatable. That is why we were happy to get unanimous support from all the other 26 member states to say that Ireland's priorities are understood and Ireland's unique position is understood. We should remember that Brexit does not interfere with the Good Friday Agreement and we will not let it interfere with it. The Agreement was signed 19 years before Brexit ever became a reality.	spk_267
Enda Kenny	66	Fine Gael	Mayo	#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_25	Thank you. In recognising the visionaries of the Good Friday Agreement, we have had support from Europe, in that, if the Agreement is ever implemented in full, that is, with a vote for consent by the democratic decision of people to join the Republic, the entire Island would be recognised as an entity of the European Union in full without having to reapply for membership.	spk_269
Enda Kenny	66	Fine Gael	Mayo	#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_25	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 9, inclusive, together. We are confident that the European Council’s adoption of the EU’s negotiating guidelines on 29 April gives Ireland its strongest hand going into these complex negotiations. The unique circumstances of Ireland have been recognised as part of the negotiations from the outset.  The Government’s priority here has been to ensure that the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, including the Good Friday Agreement which already exists, are recognised and protected within the context of the Article 50 negotiations leading to a withdrawal agreement. The Good Friday Agreement is an internationally recognised treaty, legally binding and registered with the UN. This is a key distinguishing factor regarding what is a unique political and constitutional framework on the island of Ireland. As the Government has consistently said, the only way for us to influence this process and protect our national interests, including with regard to Northern Ireland and the common travel area, is to win the understanding and support of EU partners for Ireland’s unique concerns. From the outset, these concerns have been recognised as part of the negotiation guidelines, and we have achieved this understanding through the extensive programme of outreach and engagement undertaken with our EU partners. There will be a separate agreement on the UK’s future relationship with the EU, which is likely to cover a broad range of policy areas, including trade, and which is likely to take longer to conclude than the EU-UK exit agreement. Depending on the nature of this agreement, which is subject to negotiations, approval by each member state may be required in accordance with their own domestic procedures. It is also important to remember that the future relationship agreement will require ratification by all 27 member states, including Ireland. An EU-UK exit agreement will be approved by a majority in the European Council, therefore no one member state will be in a position to block or veto a deal. Even if it were possible to veto a deal, it would not mean that the UK would not leave because under Article 50, it would simply mean that the UK would depart without appropriate arrangements in place.	spk_271
Enda Kenny	66	Fine Gael	Mayo	#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_25	"I will answer the last question first and the answer is ""Yes"". As the Deputy is aware from sitting very close to where Mr. Barnier spoke, this is one of the three priorities that needs to be dealt with. The first priority is the question of modalities and liabilities and the charge on the United Kingdom for leaving the European Union. This refers to a range of issues where contracts are in place or moneys are paid out of the European budget. There will be a difficulty in that if there is a €12 billion hole in the budget on a yearly basis, who is going to pay the extra or what programmes will be cut? Mr. Barnier stated that no country currently contributing to the European Union budget wants to pay any more and all of those in receipt of capital, grants and so on from the European Union do not want to receive any less. There will be a real problem if that is the scale of what is involved. The Deputy asked if the matter was discussed and it was. Mr. Barnier is a negotiator for Ireland and the Border is one of the first priorities. One of the second priorities relates to the rights of citizens and reciprocal rights for people from the UK living in the EU and  Deputy Howlin set out the position about the majority, equating to 72% of member states and 65% of the population. He is correct in that it would be a hollow victory. We do not want to have the case of negotiations coming to a finality at the European Council and finding ourselves stranded. That is why we have people on the negotiating task force who are in very close contact with our committee of permanent representatives to the EU, COREPER, and sherpa people in Brussels, so we know what is going on at all times in respect of the negotiating stances. I take the point of Deputies Howlin and Donnelly that it is very important for us in building those relationships to have our position cleared very early on. In fairness, most of the other European countries may not have as much interest as we do in Brexit because we are so close to Britain and for so many other reasons but they will become very interested if the hole in the budget will have an impact on programmes and structures in their countries. They might not have associated that with Brexit but if scheme X or Y is cut back or abolished altogether, people could become very interested politically. I agree with the sentiments that we need to do the work now and this will absorb so much political time from so many leaders over the next number of years. It need never have happened but it has happened."	spk_275
Enda Kenny	66	Fine Gael	Mayo	#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_25	I made a very clear decision that we should not appoint a Brexit Minister as the European Council leaders are the ones who make the decision. The European Parliament must pass the outcome and the Singapore agreement also has an impact. These mixed agreements mean the European Union has competence in some areas but individual and regional parliaments must ratify the matters at the end of the day. We have some really good people operating in London, Brussels and throughout Europe generally. They are very competent and fully focused. Whoever is the new leader of the Fine Gael Party - I hope he will become Taoiseach, with whatever structure of Government is involved - will have at his disposal all that expertise on a constant basis and be really fully informed. It will be up to that person to build relationships with the individual leaders, who seem to change on a pretty regular basis at a European level. In my experience anyway, every second or third European Council meeting has another two or three people I might not have seen before because elections take place on a very regular and irregular basis throughout Europe. I wish the best to whomever the party selects as leader. I hope it will be a focus in putting together a Government.I will finish by saying-----	spk_277

I must say that his brief carries him into stormy as well as calm waters. As someone who has been a national journalist for many years, he has learned a good deal about the responsibilities of politics at ministerial level. I am very happy with the way that he goes about his business. In respect of what Deputy Howlin said, he will be aware from his own experience that Cabinet operates on the basis of collective responsibility. All the candidates whose names came to Cabinet were deemed to be experienced, professionally competent and suitable to be nominated to the particular bench to which they applied. It is not a case of somebody going through the file and the experience of each nominee-----	spk_247

Enda Kenny	66	Fine Gael	Mayo	#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Departmental Strategy Statements	dbsect_26	I can confirm to Deputy Howlin that when the nominees were presented by the Minister for Justice and Equality, they were accepted in the normal way by the Cabinet, unanimously and without any comment. I do not want to say anything about newspaper reports and analysis. All the nominees were cleared by the JAAB as being competent and professional. The new Bill, when it is passed, will reduce the number of nominees for each position but it will still be the responsibility of Cabinet, under the Constitution, to make the choices. I acknowledge the mobile unit is not yet in place. Obviously, the Minister for Health is conscious of that fact and is working on the matter. That was the outcome of the discussions that were held with the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, at the time.	spk_251
Enda Kenny	66	Fine Gael	Mayo	#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_27	I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive, together. I have restructured my Department to ensure that Brexit is treated as a crucial cross-cutting issue by creating an amalgamated international, EU and Northern Ireland division under a second Secretary General who also acts as the Government's Sherpa for EU business, including Brexit. The work of this division includes supporting the Cabinet committee on Brexit and the Cabinet committee on European affairs. There are 32 staff assigned to this division. The international, EU and Northern Ireland division comprises three sections.The international section advises me on international policy and supports me in my international engagements with a particular focus on driving economic growth, trade, investment and job creation, as well as protecting and strengthening Ireland’s strategic relationships, interests and reputation overseas. The EU section supports me in my role as a member of the European Council and provides a coherent, whole-of-Government strategic direction on priority EU policies, including on Brexit. The Britain and Northern Ireland affairs section supports my work and the work of the Government in helping to maintain peace and to develop new relationships on the island of Ireland and between Britain and Ireland. This section supports me and the Government in ensuring there is a whole-of-Government response to the UK’s decision to leave the EU and the implications of that decision for Northern Ireland and the British-Irish relationship. Staff in other divisions also contribute to the work on Brexit. For example, the economic policy division advises me on economic policy aimed at supporting sustainable economic growth, with a particular focus on jobs and competitiveness, including possible economic impacts of Brexit. I have three special advisers, including my chief of staff. The Government Chief Whip has two special advisers. The Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, the EU digital single market and data protection has one special adviser, whose salary is paid by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The Minister of State with responsibility for defence has two special advisers, both of whom are paid by the Department of Defence. The Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora has no special adviser. Although they are not special advisers, the chief strategist for the Independent Alliance and the political co-ordinator for Independent Ministers are also based in my Department.	spk_252
Enda Kenny	66	Fine Gael	Mayo	#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_27	I can supply Deputy Martin with the audit he mentioned. I will forward him the numbers we have in terms of the appointments of diplomats and other staff who are working in different places. The Deputy made the point previously that it may become necessary to recruit or appoint people with particular experience, for instance, in trade and in the complex issues involved in that area. There is a willingness that when it becomes necessary, we can and will do that. When the issue was raised about Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, as I said, they look for particular types of people, but these negotiations have not started. Deputy Howlin is right on this. We still have a great deal of information to get from those with whom we will negotiate. Deputy Howlin made the point about knowing the thinking of people at a European level. From his experience and from that of Deputy Martin as a former Minister, it is about the building of relationships that last over a long period.	spk_259

Enda Kenny	66	Fine Gael	Mayo	#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_27	It has got to be agreed at the European Council.	spk_263
Enda Kenny	66	Fine Gael	Mayo	#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_27	Yes, but if somebody at the European Council will not accept the outcome of the deal, we will have a real problem. Deputy Howlin made a point about knowing the thinking of other European colleagues, and it takes time to build those relationships, but, as he is aware, it comes down to the European Council's decision, it is the Heads of Government who will make the ultimate decision. I take the Deputy's comments in the spirit that he made them. The presentation of our priorities, as we see them, without having all of the information in so far as what the British Government's thinking is on this, have been reflected in the Commission, Parliament and Council. However, as the Deputy pointed out, in terms of having as close as possible a working relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom, which is what we have now as a member of the European Union, that will be changed by virtue of the fact that the Single Market will be gone and the trading status will be changed. Therefore, when we go around that loop and come back to where we started we will be in a different position. Even if no tariffs will apply in terms of trade, we will still have two different jurisdictions and the complications that would involve are obvious. An Open Skies arrangement will have to be drawn up between the European Union and the United Kingdom, otherwise, aircraft will not be able to take off from here and land in London and go on to collect other passengers. That is an issue that needs to be dealt with and it is being worked upon now. We cannot wait for divorce to be concluded to do that.  The three issues identified by Michael Barnier here and agreed by Europe are the border, modalities and liabilities in terms of what the bill might be and the question of citizen's rights and reciprocal rights. All these matters, as was rightly said, were never put to the people in a way that they would have had a real discussion about understanding them. That is why our common travel area, which has been in place for 90 years covering travel, residence and the right to work and to draw social benefits, is a bilateral arrangement between Ireland and the UK and it is different with respect to rights of the Polish people or Lithuanians or Latvians who live in Great Britain. The European position is that if we want to have a parallel discussion begun, where we get into the meat of trade, we will have to make substantial progress in respect of the first three issues. I hear comments from some people across the water to the effect that progress will not be made on this, which clearly will lead to other complications.	spk_265
Enda Kenny	66	Fine Gael	Mayo	#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_27	I take the Deputy's point. A no deal situation would be catastrophic for Ireland in, for example, the beef and agrifood sectors. Deputy Nolan spoke about the Brexit position. We did not cause this, we were not responsible for it and we did not want it but we have to deal with it. In respecting the vote of the British electorate, clearly, the issues that are priority have been set out for us. Dr. Pfeiffer is perfectly entitled to his opinion but this is decided at the European Council from a European point of view. One can have all the opinions, all the ideas and all the propositions one wants but at the end of the day, political leaders have to make decisions and the choices sometimes are not very palatable. That is why we were happy to get unanimous support from all the other 26 member states to say that Ireland's priorities are understood and Ireland's unique position is understood. We should remember that Brexit does not interfere with the Good Friday Agreement and we will not let it interfere with it. The Agreement was signed 19 years before Brexit ever became a reality.	spk_267
Enda Kenny	66	Fine Gael	Mayo	#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_27	Thank you. In recognising the visionaries of the Good Friday Agreement, we have had support from Europe, in that, if the Agreement is ever implemented in full, that is, with a vote for consent by the democratic decision of people to join the Republic, the entire Island would be recognised as an entity of the European Union in full without having to reapply for membership.	spk_269
Enda Kenny	66	Fine Gael	Mayo	#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_28	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 9, inclusive, together. We are confident that the European Council’s adoption of the EU’s negotiating guidelines on 29 April gives Ireland its strongest hand going into these complex negotiations. The unique circumstances of Ireland have been recognised as part of the negotiations from the outset.  The Government’s priority here has been to ensure that the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, including the Good Friday Agreement which already exists, are recognised and protected within the context of the Article 50 negotiations leading to a withdrawal agreement. The Good Friday Agreement is an internationally recognised treaty, legally binding and registered with the UN. This is a key distinguishing factor regarding what is a unique political and constitutional framework on the island of Ireland. As the Government has consistently said, the only way for us to influence this process and protect our national interests, including with regard to Northern Ireland and the common travel area, is to win the understanding and support of EU partners for Ireland’s unique concerns. From the outset, these concerns have been recognised as part of the negotiation guidelines, and we have achieved this understanding through the extensive programme of outreach and engagement undertaken with our EU partners. There will be a separate agreement on the UK’s future relationship with the EU, which is likely to cover a broad range of policy areas, including trade, and which is likely to take longer to conclude than the EU-UK exit agreement. Depending on the nature of this agreement, which is subject to negotiations, approval by each member state may be required in accordance with their own domestic procedures. It is also important to remember that the future relationship agreement will require ratification by all 27 member states, including Ireland. An EU-UK exit agreement will be approved by a majority in the European Council, therefore no one member state will be in a position to block or veto a deal. Even if it were possible to veto a deal, it would not mean that the UK would not leave because under Article 50, it would simply mean that the UK would depart without appropriate arrangements in place.	spk_271
Enda Kenny	66	Fine Gael	Mayo	#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_28	"I will answer the last question first and the answer is ""Yes"". As the Deputy is aware from sitting very close to where Mr. Barnier spoke, this is one of the three priorities that needs to be dealt with. The first priority is the question of modalities and liabilities and the charge on the United Kingdom for leaving the European Union. This refers to a range of issues where contracts are in place or moneys are paid out of the European budget. There will be a difficulty in that if there is a €12 billion hole in the budget on a yearly basis, who is going to pay the extra or what programmes will be cut? Mr. Barnier stated that no country currently contributing to the European Union budget wants to pay any more and all of those in receipt of capital, grants and so on from the European Union do not want to receive any less. There will be a real problem if that is the scale of what is involved. The Deputy asked if the matter was discussed and it was. Mr. Barnier is a negotiator for Ireland and the Border is one of the first priorities. One of the second priorities relates to the rights of citizens and reciprocal rights for people from the UK living in the EU and  Deputy Howlin set out the position about the majority, equating to 72% of member states and 65% of the population. He is correct in that it would be a hollow victory. We do not want to have the case of negotiations coming to a finality at the European Council and finding ourselves stranded. That is why we have people on the negotiating task force who are in very close contact with our committee of permanent representatives to the EU, COREPER, and sherpa people in Brussels, so we know what is going on at all times in respect of the negotiating stances. I take the point of Deputies Howlin and Donnelly that it is very important for us in building those relationships to have our position cleared very early on. In fairness, most of the other European countries may not have as much interest as we do in Brexit because we are so close to Britain and for so many other reasons but they will become very interested if the hole in the budget will have an impact on programmes and structures in their countries. They might not have associated that with Brexit but if scheme X or Y is cut back or abolished altogether, people could become very interested politically. I agree with the sentiments that we need to do the work now and this will absorb so much political time from so many leaders over the next number of years. It need never have happened but it has happened."	spk_275
Enda Kenny	66	Fine Gael	Mayo	#EndaKenny	2017-05-31	dail	32	Brexit Issues	dbsect_28	I made a very clear decision that we should not appoint a Brexit Minister as the European Council leaders are the ones who make the decision. The European Parliament must pass the outcome and the Singapore agreement also has an impact. These mixed agreements mean the European Union has competence in some areas but individual and regional parliaments must ratify the matters at the end of the day. We have some really good people operating in London, Brussels and throughout Europe generally. They are very competent and fully focused. Whoever is the new leader of the Fine Gael Party - I hope he will become Taoiseach, with whatever structure of Government is involved - will have at his disposal all that expertise on a constant basis and be really fully informed. It will be up to that person to build relationships with the individual leaders, who seem to change on a pretty regular basis at a European level. In my experience anyway, every second or third European Council meeting has another two or three people I might not have seen before because elections take place on a very regular and irregular basis throughout Europe. I wish the best to whomever the party selects as leader. I hope it will be a focus in putting together a Government.I will finish by saying-----	spk_277
