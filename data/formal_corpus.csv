The Fine Gael-linked firm says he will provide guidance on its “future strategic direction”.

Its clients include National Broadband Ireland (which is delivering the National Broadband Plan), the media agency MediaCom, the Irish SME Association (ISME), SSE Renewables and Cork University Hospital.

The company was founded by Pat Heneghan, who was a long time advisor to former Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader Dr Garret FitzGerald.

Its Director of Public Affairs, Eoghan Ó Neachtain, previously served as government press secretary during the first year of Kenny’s term as Taoiseach, having been appointed to the job under the preceding Fianna Fáil-led government.

In a statement Kenny said he has “known Heneghan Strategic Communications for many years”.

“I look forward to supporting a dynamic team with an ambitious vision for the future of the company,” he added.

The firm’s managing director, Nigel Heneghan, said he is “honoured” that the former Taoiseach has agreed to join the board."
https://www.thejournal.ie/enda-kenny-golfgate-5400054-Apr2021/,03/04/2021,Enda Kenny says it's time to 'move on' from golfgate as he rules out presidential ambitions,"FORMER TAOISEACH ENDA Kenny has said the golfgate controversy is “in the past” and that it is tme to “move on” from what happened.

Speaking on The Late Late Show last night, Kenny said that “lessons were learned by everybody” from what happened..

Last August, the Oireachtas Golf Society organised an outing in Clifden at which members and invitees played golf before a dinner in the Station House Hotel. 

A total of 81 people attended a dinner in a room in the hotel despite Covid-19 regulations not permitting such gatherings, with a partition erected to divide the room. 

Among those who attended the golfgate dinner were then minister Dara Calleary, then EU commissioner Phil Hogan, Supreme Court judge Séamus Woulfe, former RTÉ presenter Sean O’Rourke.

Kenny played golf as part of the event but did not attend the dinner. 

Speaking last night, Kenny said that he told the organisers in advance that he would not be attending the dinner.

The first day I went back and I played golf and I had my son with me. We played golf with the captain of the Oireachtas team and a person well-known to RTÉ. We had a lovely round of golf, a beautiful evening. We were one of the last groups out, I came back into the carpark, the place was empty and went home. 
Asked about the reaction to the event and the outcry from it, Kenny says he has “put it all out of my mind”. 

“It’s all past and dealt with, I’m moving onto a different plane now.” 

Pushed on the issue further by host Ryan Tubridy, Kenny said it wasn’t necessarily about the issue going away because it didn’t concern him. 

“I told them in advance I would not be there but the mood was was such that that was the outcome. But that’s in the past now, that’s a lesson learned by everybody, move on.” 


Kenny also spoke about his retirement from politics ahead of last year’s general election, having first been elected 45 years before that. 

He said that he felt that it was not his role to comment on current political events. A former teacher, Kenny was asked about the government’s decision to move to an aged-based priority model for the vaccination of most of the country. 

Kenny said it was not for him to comment on the decision but that it’s about “vaccinating all our population and getting on with the job as quickly as we can”. 

No presidential ambitions

The former Fine Gael leader has also been suggested as a potential presidential candidate but when this was put to him he said he would not be interested in the role.

“I used to enjoy visiting both President McAleese and President Ó hÚigín, President Higgins in Áras an Úachtaráin because you have to go there to give them an update on events in the house.

After my years in politics, there’s always a life upfront, and I’m the kind of person who looks forward and up to the next horizon. And it’s not in Áras an Úachtaráin, I’d prefer to go and visit there and not be a tenant. 
Asked does he have any political regrets, Kenny said he was “far from being perfect” but he does not have any regrets. 

He said that his focus in government was to “move the economy” from where it was and to “restore respect” for the country and give it “financial integrity”. 

Asked whether years of austerity budgets under the EU-IMF Troika had shouldered austerity onto a generational and widened inequality, Kenny said:

“I’d love to have been able to do so much more to eliminate poverty, to have greater equality to deal with the issues about all of those things that you mentioned, of course. But you’re not going to be able to do any of that unless you have a country that’s stable, that’s able to generate capacity to do those things.”"

https://www.thejournal.ie/enda-kenny-north-inner-city-2-4940444-Dec2019/,18/12/2019,Enda Kenny says he wants to see a 'resurgence of pride' in Dublin's North inner city,"FORMER TAOISEACH ENDA Kenny said today that he wants to see a “resurgence of pride” in Dublin’s North inner city.

Launching a strategic plan for the northeast inner city for the next three years at  Ballybough Community Centre this morning, Kenny issued a challenge for the young and old people in the area to make the area a place to be “recognised for quality, integrity, trust and opportunity” both at home and abroad.

Speaking at the launch of the progress report on the north inner city task force report today, his first public engagement since he stepped down as Taoiseach, Kenny said “it’s your area, its your place, your people”.

To applause, Kenny told the crowd that he wanted to see a “resurgence of pride so that when people are asked where are they from, they say ‘the North inner city, a place that we transformed with the help of a lot of people”"".

The task force, launched in 2017 by Kenny, is a major initiative focused on the development of north-east inner city. It was rolled out following a spate of gangland shootings in the region.

Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said that the programme was set up in a “moment of darkness”, when the government and the community came together in the aftermath of a “truly extraordinary cycle of murder and violence”.

Donohoe, commended Kenny for his work on the project, stating that despite no longer being Taoiseach, Kenny is a frequent visitor of the area and champion of the project. 

In his speech, Kenny said he spoke to one woman who had recently completed an apprenticeship in one of the large corporations situated just off Sheriff Street, highlighting what it meant to the local woman to get such an opportunity. 

Developing apprenticeships with local businesses and industry in the IFSC for young people is one of the key focuses of the plan, with 18 paid student work placements taking place during the summer.

The chair of the taskforce, Michael Stone, sent out a clear message to companies located in the area, stating it is “the duty of businesses in the North inner city to get involved in the area”. He added that companies can’t come into the area, and build buildings in the area, without supporting the community.

In 2017, when visiting the area, Kenny spoke to one man who said he was discriminated against in a job interview because he came from the area.

“How could a knacker like that speak Portuguese,” is what the young man claimed was said about him when applying for a job in the area.

The local man, Paul McKeown told Kenny at the time that he had experienced discrimination while job-seeking, despite having a Master’s degree and being fluent in Portuguese.

“No one, no one should have to deal with that,” said Kenny at the time.

Since 2017, a number of companies in the area have been offering internships, jobs and funds have been established to give young people experience as part of a youth diversion programme.

In 2019, €6.5 million in funding was dedicated to the project which helped set up a new inclusion health hub as well as a rehab centre for drug users from the Dublin 1 area."
https://www.thejournal.ie/enda-kenny-royal-regatta-4758568-Aug2019/,09/08/2019,Enda Kenny crewed the winning racing yacht with Bear Grylls in a big royal regatta yesterday,"EVER WONDER WHAT former Taoisigh get up to once they’re out of office?

We’re sure Enda Kenny doesn’t spend every day hanging around with celebrities, royals and assorted sailing types – but that’s exactly what he was up to yesterday.

The former Fine Gael leader, who left office in June 2017, was part of the winning crew in Bear Grylls’ yacht at a charity royal regatta on the Isle of Wight. 

The fancy affair was hosted by none other than the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge Prince William and Kate Middleton and took place in the seaport town of Cowes.

Enda was part of TV star and adventurer Grylls crew on the yacht for African wildlife conservation charity Tusk, which won the competition outright. 


Kensington Palace / Twitter
We’re told he’s a supporter of the charity and that support obviously gets him some nice days out from time to time. 

Seven other charities took part in the competition yesterday, with William and Kate also climbing onboard, but it was the dynamic duo of Grylls and Kenny who took home the gold.

Of course this isn’t Enda’s first time hanging out with the royals since his retirement.

He was spotted rubbing shoulders with Harry and Meghan last year he handed out awards at a polo tournament.

The former Taoiseach is clearly making the most of his time since he surrendered the Fine Gael leadership. Beats chasing rats around the Dáil bar any day. "
